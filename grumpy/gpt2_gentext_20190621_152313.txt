We see, then, that religions are not only insufficient for the task of training children to believe, but they are also absurd and an disgrace to the State, ecclesiastical, and to the State itself; for the truths which appear absurd and absurd only strengthen the bonds of law and order. Hence, as a punishment for not believing in the Bible, many people have recourse to miracle and revelation in order to believe in Indian, Greek, and Christian doctrines. But what can be more absurd than the belief that all religions are the result of Jewish design, and all religions are a fraud; and as a punishment for not believing in them, many a man has recourse to the most ridiculous system of pseudoscience, inventing all sorts of things that are really absurd, such as the story of the Fall, or the story of the Judgment of Judgment, or even the absurdities of the Pantheists. For to have a safe and sound system of belief one must first of all have something to do with the facts, which are already there absurd  that is to say, you must have something to do with them rationalised and valid by experiments, and that when you have obtained a rationalisation and a valid justification you can apply it to the circumstances in which the facts already exist. For instance, if you have obtained a rationalised justification you may apply it to the circumstances in which the doctrines already exist, and so on up to the Epistles and the Revelation. To form a system of rationalisation and valid justification one must combine many qualities, from the fact that it is a new belief system first, and a priori to it, that are necessary for its successful introduction. Knowledge that one has a priori knowledge derived from other sources is a quality that is common to all; and because it is a quality where the basis of belief is also a quality, it is placed before the word validity. It is the word, however, which makes it possible for a person to believe without ever having read the book itself. So much for the justification of one belief alone.A man who has not taken other things into his own hands can have no other conviction than that he has lost his mind. This is especially evident in the case of those who have acquired their own knowledge by reading, as is the case for most people. Reading has great consequences. First of all, it makes them inactive, and makes them ridiculous. Second, it makes them more inclined to believe, more inclined to be convinced, and inclined to omit things which might be evidence of their own good faith. And thirdly, it makes them less inclined to look to books in order to carry out their studies; and lastly, it makes them less inclined to think. This is why professionalmen have become so attached to the impression of what is false and ridiculous. Some people think that what they read is not really wrong, but that it is afterwards proved to be neither right nor true; that it is a fabric for telling the truth, and they persist in reading in the hope that it will last them some time. But the fabric is soon unwound by reading, and people lose their cheerful confidence in it. The Cure for Reading and the Bodies of Phlegmatic People Is Transcendentalism In this sense a man named Plato says: the mind is the vessel by which we perceive the really things lying in our way of perceiving and talking. Reading and the Bodies of Phlegmatic People Plato is quite right in distinguishing between the representation of truth in the form of a Readingandthat it is really something.

What makes a man so good is this: his faults and vices remain, even under the most favourable circumstances, the same as those of the rest of mankind: they remain only as to what; and under the most favourable circumstances they do not change. This is the case, however, where the faults are encountered with the only knowledge that they are present. Under the most favourable circumstances errors do not exist; they merely form a irregular and irregular outline of what is known. Under the most favourable circumstances there is no such thing as punctum saliens; errors which, in the proper sense of the word, stem from the misapplied word, and do not merely appear as a new word; such as grammarians, infirmists, and those who work with their hands commonly call a new accent. Under the most favourable circumstances writing is much easier and more conveniently done by post than by gesticulation; but still, everyone is a writer, and he writes for the sake of writing; and this is why there is such a thing as posthumous vanity.There are many writers who possess both an original and genuine talent for writing, and there are many who, like Leasing, manage seriously to write with that talent. This is also why the last pages of the bestsellers whose real names are mentioned are sent to them in prize winning condition, as soon as they are published in voluminous records. There is no author so great for the range of human thought, so wide a horizons, so evergrowing the charms of human beauty. As an illustration of this, look at any periodical reprint or other periodical publication and you will see that countless works, begun before long, are invariably wrecked and ruined; the worst of all, for they are written as a rule with such randomness that they seldom appear in a position to be of value. So you will forgive them if, later, a new and improved work arrives with such rapid and total success that you regret that you had not sooner obtained it and so have corrected and improved it in each succeeding copy.It is only the works of true philosophy that are genuine and genuine because they have been thought out by the wisdom of experience and their value lies in the fact that it is based upon a rule which is universally adopted  that the error should occur sooner rather than later; or, more frequently, the error occurs sooner rather than later. This applies to the whole of our existence, to the very various degrees of perfection. The inevitable result of this is that the system of philosophy is like a clock that makes minutes too minute to be accurate. The system is true only for a certain period, but it is true for a certain length of time. Time is the illusion that marks the period of perfection; it makes the dogmas of the intellect and of the sciences unnecessary and garbled; and the false idea that it is necessary for the sake of the philosophers to make its appearance in the works of the old philosophers, especially since the time of Aviat Godavigation, has its share of fruit; meanwhile the new system, which is based upon the doctrine of metempsychosis, appears to be the fruit of their errors. For example, the Christian system establishes God as eternal and not as temporal, and consequently offers no temporal value; while the Jewish system and the Christian system, be the further reason why the Jewish god is not a mere allegorical character, is apparent; but still the prophetic aspect is theological in its deepest sense. And as the meaning of a word, as the key to its signification, is based upon a definite proposition, as the quintessence of the word, so the meaning of a word is also given by the quintessence to the whole of its meaning; so that the signification of a word is based upon a merely quintessential character, as though we should change it for another. The same thing applies to intellectual qualities, to character, as it applies to the intellectual qualities of an individual. The better, therefore, that the intellectual qualities are accomplished, the easier it will be for him to overcome and overcome humanity at large. And in chess, every movement is its greatest success, so that as soon as the game is over, the number of victories increases from the main sequence, which is an allegorical representation of the victory is assured, and the impression of the mistake becomes a subject for ridicule, even though the mistake was made only a moment ago. In the same way the chess master who is constantly reminding the new players of their rights and obligations always makes them feel that they have grasped the true point of view of their game, and not only understood it, but was earnest in his praise for them, although he totally failed to erase it.The difference between the impression that a man makes and the true view he takes are difficult to make out, because the man who makes the difference has no knowledge of the game or of the world, has neither the imagination nor the vision to see clearly and accurately, and yet by coming to a decision or finding out
====================
We find in the Koran a number of passages which make the followers of the Ahl al Arab, or the Islamic religion, and some of them of the same creed, the Ahl al Arab being the final resting place of all those religions. In the same way when the followers of the Mohammedans got into the Arabian peninsula they got possession of all the treasures which they were to lose by going to America. We find that the adherents of Christianity, even though they were followers of the false prophet Mohammed, and in Mohammedan Islam got possession of the treasure, they made no profession of it, and repeated their assertion a hundred times, as though it were a matter of secret pressing, before God, five times in a row, in behalf of his dogma. This is because, as has been said, the doctrines of the new religion were originally laid down by Constantine, and, as a special favor, meant effect upon him, that the workmen who made these doctrines, even though they were followers of the prophet, were not permitted to speak of him. The result of this is that, as has been said, the treasures which the followers of the new religion have in its way are not one and undiminished, but, with the exception of those rare cases where it was necessary to make a sacrifice and had other needs before it, in order to gratify the desire of the clergy, who, in England, are represented as full traders in their own right, and face to face with their people in the different religions. In view of this condition of things, and because the followers of the new religion are the first to be crushed by the crude activity of the press, I should advise my advice to those who are still alive to this; take up a paper or two, and reflect for a while on what you are. You will then have found your philosophy vindicated and your religion extinct. You may put down your mistrusty fireplaces and get good cheer before you of some one who runs a shop in new and strange religions. You will also have found that everything you have read has convinced you that life in new and strange religions is a roguery carried away by the fools every day, so that there is no shop in every corner. You must leave this subject for another time.In the last resort, it is a good idea to take a look at the works of the great minds of the past, if they are in some way, or in some fashion, fundamentally incompatible with ours. For example, if in our day the Metaphysics of Fichte and Schelling have preceded that of Kant, in our day the Philosophy of Hegel it is the Immutable Truths, or the Instincts of the Soul. And if, in the same moment, the World and the Arts of Being are, as it were, combined, that is to say, the Willingness and Fichte of the One and the Only Being, so that the medium of Thought and Knowledge is to be sought in the Peripatetic Gorgon, and all that the Gorgon has that is placed upon the Gorgon is carried away; and then, again, the world and the world has received from the Gorgon a little while before it is brought into play. It is a big part of the reason why the world and the world is so very strange, and why I say very little must be explained.The nervous system is the system which makes the development of the next generation impossible. It has no thought for anything else, and is carried away by the body of the mind following after the morrow. This is why, as soon as the morrow has been marked by a marked difference from that which preceded it, the whole of our existence is suspended in horror. The man who is fifty years old will experience a complete paralysis of the brain in consequence of the embitterment of the hanging or the falling of the deadhead. It is the same in men of sixty.The fright I feel at the sight of the body of a living man lying dying in his arms,̶ in the fright that goes on like a raging Angel of death,̶ when, overcome by that same fear, I dash away from the sight of the body and run away from it, into the arms of my parents, who were with my father when he was a boy, and often remember him with all their strength and delight. This kind of terror is common to the Mohammedans; and it is also the case among the Buddhists; for the sight of the body and death of a son or daughter do not leave the senses, but instead pass away slowly and easily into the unconscious. One feels the sting of the incurable disease killing the father and the mother; but the son, who has received the blessing of the father, is killed out of fear; so that the son stands in the way of the father when the father is not with him. This is the feeling commonly accorded the rest of the world: India is the grave of one Masi

It is a fact that the best novels are the monologues of the intellect. In this respect these, then, hold a higher claim than to the same thing, that they are the refutation and elaboration of the worst novels of all. Further, while every one who has spent his life in academia has discovered that the more mature a thought is, the later it is in maturity. This is especially the case when the author is a man of note, for the simple reason that his is no longer a human face in a museum in Munich. A man of note, however, is a man of genius, who in another sense or trait grasps his own nature more closely than any other.In any German language literary newspapers are not maliciously suppressed, as you may expect from the most sophisticated of nations, who do not find in a word of English newsprints anything in the way of reading novels? Most people are very much pleased to leave the country if they find a novel in their line of work, which they think will excite their interest; but this is an affair governed solely and in vain; they eagerly anticipate new books and articles every year. As a rule, these anxious to read only what are short, wellknown books of the most eminent minds of all nations. Novels are not only useless, but also represent only a very limited amount of life  nay, could be described as myth and allegory. They are like a fable that in its heart cannot be true; but can easily be confirmed by reading the description and telling the real history of the author. In this way novelists may read more widely, and make more money, whilst the less experienced man may read more quietly, acquire a more mature knowledge of the subject, and generally his faculties would be more perfect. On the other hand those with moderate experience will generally be more attentive to the advance of knowledge, and will require a less mature and accurate knowledge of the subject than the advanced individual. In Germany the advances of knowledge are sometimes made by letters, sometimes novels, but these never write; they die young, and live for nothing. They have no great books to write for them, and only a few exceptional works to impart. They are literary parasites, the parasites of the future. These people are of low birth, and left no better proof of anything than their propensity towards reading than those works of the most eminent minds of the State, without any better proof of their worth than those of the few who have the upper hand. The works of great minds are on the line a mere signifier of low intellectual qualities, when it is understood that what they have written is nothing more than a short, obscure letter from them which has been sent merely by the author.So far, then, it is merely theoretical that one takes when one reads about ideas; but if one has no theoretical motive one will not believe in them, and when one does, it is often in vain. On the other hand, reading about ideas withers the mind and chokethign the mind. If one were able to remain at it for any length or length of time, one would sooner die than watch the intellectual ferment from which he was thrown, and perhaps conclude that it was right when he did so.There are at all times two literatures in Germany, the old and the new. The one is in a fair place; the other is in very bad. The bad thing about all these is that it makes one longing for revenge difficult to bear.To be sure, the constitution of a State is a body of laws which are not fit to endure for a lifetime. In the original idea of it, a Parliament was constituted and fixedrahhip, and the people were to elect a speaker, who, besides his term, rested from time to time. But all through the whole of the Prussian periodaries anything could be ameliorated by a change in the constitution, whereby the number of men allowed to vote were reduced to four from ten, and the number to sixteen from sixteen. In the whole of times this change was attempted only a few times, and succeeded in making them less and less attractive; and so in the whole of political science there is a passage in Schopenhauer called the Berlin Wall. It was written after the death of the founder of the German nation, and applied to conduct nowhere near the same measure of scrutiny as was to be applied to the founders of other nations. We have, it is true, fallen back on the word of a Justice of the Peace, which says nothing of the kind; but when it comes to the matter in question, Justice is as nonsensical as ever was. There has been nothing in the world so absurd and so ridiculous as this that will stop the little embittered man who thinks that it is on trial, and protests that it is a ridiculous trial.The courts have never satisfied them, and the reason for it is this: that if they have not got what they want, the amiable barrister comes in and gets your

Speech and memory are systems of thought, which as soon as the author has been given a subject may be said to have acquired it by hearing. But the capacity for hearing is weaker, and thus a man cannot get a subject heard; because the latter requires that the former have acquired it. But when the subject is acquired, the power of dissimulation is lost, and the capacity for remembering is gained.When a man sees a great or a small for the little, he thinks of no longer having any things to say. This is the case whether he has been thinking of them or not.When a man thinks for a long time of not having anything to say, he looks away from the world in front of him, finding no other to say but what has just been said. This is the same process as a man identifying with a species or with a race, when he sees a bird by its plumage. No longer will he see anything but what is presented itself, in other words, the species in question is no longer existent.The present state of consciousness is not so bad as posterity imagined. The world is no longer here, and the man who has been in the past lives on in the shape of his finger; whereas, who is present in the present, and remembers the past, will be entirely overmatched by it.The best consolation in this is that the indolent historian is great as long as his finger is used to holding the record straight.It is the same with the view which history makes of the life of all men who are still to come. Most men are so blank and indefinite in their hearts that they have no ideas what to think about them. If they start with such empty thoughts they are in actuality starting a blank slate. The history of humanity, like that of art, should be based on the possession that a man has of the person to whom he wishes to be born; a claim which he takes for a fictitious person, and which he takes for real when he deceives us.The existence of a mans ideas, and of his recollections in general, is a correspondence between them and that of a man. He has no clear notion of when or where he came into the world, or what he is thinking about it. His recollections, instead, are fixed and determined for a very definite purpose; and they remain with him until the point which they have always fixed and determined is reached. Thus it is that they are never given for a man. His recollections are always fixed and determined for a purpose, and they are never given for anything else. There is, in other words, a perfect correspondence between the will to live and the memory, to whatever it may be like in that moment. It is as though the will said to all alone, -- since it is all for nothing  were to say, so would the man to whom it is all for him.The best example of this is furnished by the brilliant Sophoclean wisdom we read in most newspapers; I regret that I has skipped it. It is a simple and striking rule, and it is just as true in the case of languages as it is in the case of languages: everything that is true in the one case but is false in the other, is false in the one and true in the other. Therefore, in the meaning of the word innocence, we read: it is the good or evil which is true in the one case but false in the other. But in the meaning of the word treachery, we read treachery; it is the good or evil which is true in the one but false in the other. Therefore, in the meaning of the word to forgive, we read forgive. And in the same way we wish to say: We wish to forgive you, but the badfinger of the truth is always apt to come by us, and we wish it to fail, and so it is that our finger is always at his ear.In the ordinary meaning of the word innocence, if it is true that is all is right in the world; if it is not true that is true in the world, it is either: One is mistaken in your heart; forgive me if I've been wickedly inring you in particular cases of wrong.OriginsOfAllIjusKant root: Maecenae to morum veri.Nonesescrit.Werd van deen maken enveniam!13 Hoboeron perieron.Ainne werd de megenioenioen nebioresiden iinde.And, in truth, it is all very probable, all the same with it that two men are murdered in one night, and the first is bound to the stake for the remainder. The second is more certain; but even this probability is reason enough to justify the breaking of the news to your loved one. The same thing, I admit, happens to many murderers; but it is still more certain than the first, and makes news to many

Siegfried! !forte! !in which there is no room for surprise! Siegfried! You are quite right in saying that! There is still room for error. There is still room for dissimulation. There is still room for illusion under the circumstances. There is, however, room for the illusion to be present only in the individual, and only in so far as those circumstances are favourable to it. For example, in the case of an illusion to which I have referred, the shadow of the man standing in the street looks exactly like the shadow of the man standing in the same street. In this case the illusion must be brought to a pass by making out with the greatest accuracy the identity of the person with whom the illusionary effect is principally due.If you try to make up any kind of intellect for an hour, or for any length, you shall find that the person speaking has been much more active, lively, and emotionless than the one before stated. For the intellect is not only of a nature equivalent to that of matter; it is also much more distinct from it than ordinary intellect is. So that it looks as if the most ardent of desires had been made with greater accuracy and accuracy! It is a bad thing that the special and special mastery which the special mastery of a genius on the whole possesses itself out of all proportion to the degree of his intelligence possessed! For a man on the whole system of intellect would look upon anything crass, if he could perceive how that special mastery worked. The ordinary man, that is to say the fool, when he speaks, thinks for himself. It is only the thinker who can see. The special mastery which the special mastery of a genius on the whole possesses is not to think for itself, but to perceive what other people cannot see. For the ordinary man sees everything, whatever the light of education may bring. But if he has any special insight or insight of his own, he can see that the special mastery of a genius on the whole possesses in a man by a very considerable amount of blunted reason and greater reason certain things he cannot see in others, so that his reasoning power may be reduced to a minimum. But the special mastery of a genius on the whole cannot do this: the reason must be of a higher kind, and be of a higher order of existence. So it is that truths may not be deducible from the reasoning faculty alone, but from a small number of men who are directly acquainted with the higher kind of knowledge, directly employing it in their own thought, directly advancing knowledge, and in so doing making it known to the others. This further work of the special mastery must be continued for ever. The reason that any one man can see further works in the mind as a whole, and therefore works in a double manner. It is the advance kind of thinking among men, who among others add to the knowledge that is latent in another. It is the further development of the reason reported to have this advance thinking added to, that is to say, overcomes the original error of the report. It is the same as an oak cutting through a hedge in order to clear a hole in the foundation of a mooring. No more is necessary if the elder oak is in place. oak in its entirety is a true historical figure, for it stands in direct opposition to the pretentiousness and vehemence of religion, which pretends to be the thread of science, but is actually hindering it by limiting its range. It is a truly historical figure, for in its stead science and practice are brought forth, and a new kind of historian is brought in, a truly historical figure of the kind to be brought forth from the ground up. This kind of historian shall possess both a mind and a will both of which are very strong. He shall have the memory of the past and of the present in his hands, as also in his, and he shall have the memory of the past and of the present herself. History, as a rule, is a picture to the mind, and a picture which is worth a thousand mirrors. Its advantages and disadvantages are presented to the historian in brilliant colours and striking contrast to his naked self; and he shall not see anything otherwise. This is because the history of every man is a great census of human affairs; and the more he reads the less clearly he sees the matter for himself. A man will oftenenses his ignorance towards a man, and it will easily develop into fondness for him. This is why such people become fond of reading what they are not fond of talking about: they become convinced of somethingariy law. This explains why it is that we read a great deal, and that in general we do not want to read about it. On the other hand,
====================
It is a wonderful thing that all things heavenward should have to give everything. If an angel has given everything, how can he be everything? If he has not given everything, how is he to be anything but what he is? This is the impossible and capricious position demanded in these last terms. All things he gives everything. In other words, heavenward has given everything to him. If he cannot give everything, there is nothing he can do about it; there is only the emptiness of his will, of the will to live. Therefore, if he can give everything, heavenward must be indifferent to him; in other words, no one can give everything to him. In this way there is an angelic home to all will  an empty tomb, a world where there is nothing to be had but what has been begotten, and where the individual will remains indestructible. In the same way, an empty stomach means there is no food, no clothing, no clothing for the individual to wipe away the evil of the present. In any case, an empty stomach means the will is dry and inert, and the individual will is limited to what has been begotten; and if this is not enough, there is death in every man, and it is only the burial of the will that is the matter of dispute. The will to live, as such, is the most complete manifestation of the will to live, and its preservation must be the domain of the will itself. Therefore, if the individual desires to become immortal, and is not satisfied with a hundred little forms, such as polarity,  or even answering the name of the species Venerable Walter Scott, there is no best method of saving him than to take the form of a man himself. An old and favored letter from the person who wrote the note says that immortal life is an impossibility, and that it is only by means of an immortal soul that a man can become immortal. The old and lamented maxim is simply this: Don't ask why I don't get immortal. But it appears that there is a more or less a valid reason for this, maybesignificality. If an individual is stupid and stupid enough to become immortal, it is only because of the way in which he acts in regard to his intelligence and reason; and it is only because his intellect is weak that his body works without its being expressed in a definite and irreducible way. If he is stupid enough to become an intellectual man, he is only intellectual in the essential point of it so ironical as to be completely unintelligent.If any one criticises my work, it is conscious that I have not done enough for theoretical and practical culture; that my style is short, hoary and superficial, and that I take a very cold and materialist tone. This is a great mistake, and a sure indication that the old style is no longer applicable. The most appropriate title for this book is a) Which Wants to be a Man? b) Essays on the Fine Arts of Art: A Treatise on Fine Arts for a New Age Man, by the famous Chinese artist  dum dum times. I have no doubt that his style will be much better, but at this late date it seems a distant memory. The best way to preserve the art of painting in their own hands is by abolishing the special state of appropriateness which allowed them to make use of modern technology  to say nothing of that grand palette of colors which is now open to public display. I am quite ready to give up the art of painting in favor of the next most excellent method of preserving and improving upon it: I mean, the technique of taking small, sharp, vivid, and beautiful images, which are then spread over a very narrow and short period, and applying them with greater accuracy and grace than their portraits could ever show. These can be made into picturesque works by means of the illusion of anamorphosing them into a high culture and a fabulous form; and when this is accomplished, the age of pictures is over, and the art of painting no longer so important.However, the age cannot be put in its proper historical sense; for it is in too great a degree a subordinate age to be able to preserve and enhance the art of painting in the special way that it can in that other, which is subordinate, sphere, such as photography or videography. This other may be preserved in the form of an historical beautiful man or woman, a common age without any of those special pictures that are commonly preserved in the gallery of great numbers. It is quite in keeping with the art of the past century that we now possess the rarefied kind of beauty, rarefied even by the very rare, the rarefied man of today. Here we have a world which was made up of such great and famous people as Jean Paul; Florence Foster Jenkins; Niki Ristori; and now, again, here, a world where artists after Garcespo do the same

What kind of influence is there in the world that calls itself civilized? It is in Europe that civilization calls forth the savage savage, which in the hearts of its youth was called the savages. In the East, the barbarians were the ancestors of the moderns and the ancestors of the barbarians. They were the heathens of India, whom the Vedas refer to in their example as the Buddhists. In the West, the Buddhists are the ancients, the Greeks the Vedas, the Romans the Pantheists, and Judaism the Iaches. But in Europe those races which are in the path of ruin are the conveniences of the East, and as a rule they are like a sack full of excrement. If it is not too late for Christianity to recover its footing in the West, it will be by the revolt of the heathens from the barbarians.The downfall of the ancient order can be predicted by the revolt of the heathens from the ancients. The outcome of this is a matter of no surprise to anyone who has spent any time in Italy. The priests and their messengers were such a common sight amongst the ancients: they are said to have shot up in glee at the opportunity of meeting them. The history of religion shows that most of the time they are not so lucky. In the Vedas, Brahma, the son of a tradesman and a barrister, tells of the farewells and sufferings of his kinsmen, who, he says, are shot up in laughter at his failure. In the sixteenth century, the custom of Stobaeus deorum showing no trace of a trace of irony in his eulogies of Macchiavellis played out in triumphal splendour. Who has not been overstuffed by the miseries of the Brahman and Buddhist empires, and been unlucky enough to end in death, the Indian and the Chinese?To be sure, the stunted, the single figures, the monastic and the monastic orders, are certainly in a position to which they can be put when they last in transit; but the point at which they may be most completely disregarded is when the Continent takes a turn for Europe. The ancients, reckoned, as the last great epoch of human civilisation, were not so far from taking a turn of themselves as they were from anything that a quarter of a century previously had been.So it is as regards the ancients that are as far removed from the error as they are from the error is in the question of women. The arguments which women take are of a weak description and are of a construction which will be judged by her own experience; and the outcome of them is a matter of no consequence. For instance, the argument is made that woman should not wear the outer garment of society, but that man should have the outer garment alone. The argument proceeds by an argumentical impossibility, which is put on her behalf by the lady, although it is in a ridiculous and ridiculous way. It is proved by the fact that women of the earlier age were quite silent about social matters, and men who were in a better position called forth to defend women in matters of difficulty. And this is in spite of the fact that the ancients had no sense in the matter, and treated women in a very negative light.The arrangement which the ancients had taken up such a system as this as the school of Christianity, whereby woman should remain behind, was a deviation from the proper mode of life, as otherwise called for in Judaism, which was immediately based on the idea of a Kingdom of God. And it is quite in keeping with this that the Church has always tried to have her seen that she is not a passive spectator in all matters of beauty and grace, but is actually a active one, and looks upon them as something that is attached to the moment. This is shown in every artistic sense of the word, up to the present time the height of vulgarity in the representation of women. It also appears in all religions, in every mode of expression, in a dress up or down, as if it were necessary to represent them all at once. This is because the Divine Comedy gives a certain seduction to the use of vulgarity, as is said above of women. But if they are stripped bare, the effect is the same: they are seen that they are naked, and therefore entitled to nothing but the crumbs of their degradationly deserved fame and fortune. This is why the ancients, when they talked of beauties, have talked of evils; and it is all very hyperbolical! It is all very hyperbolical! It may be so, if a man wants to get a living. But to degrade women as passive bystanders is degrading in its extreme and calculated form, as it renders them into a mere prop of the egoism of the greatest ruling class of men, who, moreover, loves his position and enjoys to see his friends murdered. Among the ancients there is no saying that sex,

In this way the spirit of the new religion will be more ardent, and it will pursue with its whole'scliffe the path of redemption from the curse of the fathers existence and of endless existence; and it will dwell more firmly in the pit of illusion than in the grave.Demop. That may be, but it is the only way of achieving it.Phil. Which is a very questionable argument, since the flagrantial and systematic abuse of religion is in no way lessening the suffering of the mankind. There are religions, however, that are minimis for the egoism of the masses, and for the vanity of the few; nay, for those for the cleverest breaks of intellect and penitence.Demop. Indeed, nay, even if you could get a clear conscience, this would be impossible; you must take a purely objective standpoint.Phil. I am surprised to hear you say that, for the simple reason that you cannot get a clear conscience. There are, strictly speaking, four senses in which a purely objective standpoint may be able to cure you of one or two of the defects in the Christian religion: 1st sense is that it is a deviation from the truth, and this from the path of redemption, which is its aim. This is not a merely metaphysical cure, but it might be possible if we could make the diagnostic use of the scientific data of the time, and distinguish between what is true in the case of truth and what is falsity. It is the recognition of the truth in the case of allegory, which is particularly attractive. But in practical life allegory always presents a figment of our own soul, and as a rule it is easily contradicted. Therefore it is that defective from the moment of view of religion. It is the kernel of the human race, and should it be necessary to extend it, would be a monster. It is a contradiction in practice, and the worst of it is that it often turns out as a result of their wish. Not only does the Church make all religions perfect, but she infallibly and clearly guides all others; hence, everywhere and at all times, she served as the de facto authority in the whole of Christianity. This is a doctrine which is not only palpably absurd, but it is alsoed to be absurd when carried out by the philosophers; for the philosophers alone are the real doctors and nurses of the souls of dead people. Tombs are a place of safety from them, for the intelligent multitude must always be with us always, and always ready to help when we need them. The Pope declares in the De Civitate Dei Laetitia:') So let the philosophical pedagogue, who has the noble aim of cracking down on philosophical dissent, be allowed to speak for the great masses. Otherwise there will be religious wars, civil wars, and wars in the streets, and there will be religion as well. There will be general wars, all the more frequent and more successful, because the multitude is of a like nature; so that the uttermost cannot be reasoned about anything else than as a whole. Such general evils as these can never be contained, and are accordingly given up by the Christian religion to the painless overthrow of the Church. This was the case even in the ancient world, where, owing to the pains of the catarrh, rulers made polygamy a condition of office, and in later times also mandating it everywhere, so that kings and priests could make no distinction between their people and the freemen of the land. Even the ancient Magers very frequently annulled this practice, so that today they are better equipped to prevent and control the flow of souls to the void. It is, to be sure, to be questioned whether it is still capable of being true of the ancient Greeks and Romans, to explain what is so singular and shallow about this? The very thought of which I am speaking. Why is it that in the very first passages of the New Testament, and in the very last, in the very first chapter of the Old Testament, the evil omens areamed with a positive cheer, not only of the righteous in Egypt, but of the unrighteous in the wilderness? The whole of Judaism is a trace of this scheme, as far as my system of doctrine is concerned; and yet it is the only system that is consistent with it. The whole of Judaism is a manifestation of the will to live, a steadfast faithful imitation of the will of the Creator. Every religion sets its stars for failure, every yearably great undertaking, and year by year, constantly advancing its temptations and applying them into a whole new way of life. But the followers of the New Testament religion must be kept in mind that its doctrines are a mirror of the will of the Creator, and so its articles of faith must be tolerant of every kind. For the doctrines of the Old Testament were not in conformity with the will of the Godhead, and, in consequence, of the law of generations. These are the principles of the New;
====================
We have here to look upon a religious incident as a purely philosophical one. In the year 1840, more than a hundred fundamental churchmen, priests, philosophers, and others were arrested for trying to establish a State Religion, and for trying to teach the principles of the new State religion. The criminal law was strengthened by the first general application of the principles of religion to religious wars, into the arms trade, into the ecclesiastical subjects, into the works of the ministers themselves, into the morals and religion of the clergy, into the daily and spiritual affairs of every man. In short, under the name of Christianity and under the name of the new State religion, the whole race was compelled to work, in all weather, into the darkest depths of the grave, in order that the whip might strike fear into the hearts of his unbelievers. For to enlist in these new laws the armies should be set up in basthorses and brought into the synagogues; and the coldblooded slaughter of the masses would have been a barbarity. It was barbarity and war that George Sand that barbarity; and now George is welcome in the States, where he can make war on any man he please, nay, may he not fight the first opportunity offered him. Sand has been honest in his advocacy of the new State religion, and by his advocacy has made a good share of the soldiers a witness of the spirit of impunity killing those who give the cause their best. He has also been honest in his advocacy of the old State religion, and made a good share of the soldiers in the blood of fallen brothers and fathers, whether it is their own or that of their parents; and it surprises me that such a man should give such a talk about religion. There is no absurdity in it; it is a system which only looks upon the religious persecution of the Hindoos in its time as a great misfortune, and only traces its roots in the Christian dogma of Predestination and Faith. It should be obvious to everybody that the Hindoos were extremely careful to form a caste system of religion, and to employ it as a weapon in their war with the Buddhists. This weapon was very cleverly employed, however, by the Chinese, who, in the opinion of their priests, invented the word religion in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and by Catholics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This system of belief was soon incorporated into the Christian religion, and by the aid of the inquisitions and the Christian rule in India that was rectified in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. You see, I may say here that the New Testament teaches the immortality of the soul and a resurrection in Christ; but the Old Testament does not. The New Testament condemns suicide as an act of violence, a sedition, a crime against the person, although it never mentions it, or the culpability of others; whereas it condemns suicide as an act of grace, a justification of their actions; whereas the Old Testament condemns it as a crime against them, even though it never mentions it, and the penalty for it is death. The penalty for suicide is death by eternal damnation; the New Testament calls it eternal life, and the punishment for it is eternal torment.The New Testament condemns suicide as an act of wickedness, a persecutionsse for the sake of the kingdom of God, and a denial of the resurrection of the body; whereas the Old Testament calls it eternal life, and the punishment for it is eternal torment.The argumentum ad verecundiams is a common objection to the doctrine of supernatural mental suffering, because it is presented to us as opposed to moral suffering  that is to say, as the consequence of the laws of nature. But the view I have taken of it is not opposed to the laws of nature, but taken by them from the picture of the intellectual world which we see in when we come to look at the matter round its corners. It shows that the metaphysical laws are not there, but are taken by them; and when the metaphysical law is abolished, the conception of the mind is and remains the same. But now the way in which the law of nature, which provides for the maintenance of the constitution and all things pleasurable to the senses, is brought into play  that is, when the phantom of the intellect comes into the world, we have it on good terms with the rational world, but it has also fulfilled the functions referred to in the constitution and all things palpable to it. This is why the old philosophers looked upon suicide as a crime against the world. This is no longer so and what is left is an argumentum ad verecundiam; and it is not a case of the old philosophers looking at the matter from a moral point of view, as they did in the case of criminals, but of the rational world. There is a difference between a crime against the world and a crime in his own province. The former is a mere blustering; the latter is a genuine confession of some crime.
====================
How many great masters have it among mankind that live on in the present day only as masters of some one former life; how few, if any, amongst the dead; how little or no return they make after a hundred years.Philalethes. They exist only as a kind of ghost, to be reckoned from the look on them that has not gone away. They are the controlled individualists, and the history of philosophy, I believe, will be like that of the priest over the elect.He who has lost all control of his desires will not read philosophy, but will, with the company, print up anything and everything that he sees and fears and fears more about the dead man than he has now; and for the sake of this he can always sacrifice what is absolutely necessary to his happiness; for it is what the elect has lost all over again. People like this never existed; they existed only in the past. There was always a great and original force behind their pictures, a Creator God from without; and it was just from that source that philosophy and religion sprang up.Philalethes. The former, it is true, which is so intensely his concern and thoughts during his life: but the latter are limited to what is necessary for his happiness; he never concerns himself either with what is necessary for the latter or with what is unnecessary for the former. The former is what makes possible the continued existence and constant progress of his present affairs; the latter is what makes possible the continual and rapid degeneration of what he saw, heard, or read; and what depends upon them the greatest or the least of all the pleasure in so doing. While, on the other hand, the former is what enables him to see and look at the world, which he now sees with his own eyes, sees with his own heads, hears with his own hands, and is made cognisable by his conversation. People like these are like the former; they were in the past, and can be got again; they are what depend upon it the greatest or the least of all pleasures. They are what make possible the continual and continuous progress of his present affairs. Hence the history of religion is always full of sham and perversity; and this is why their metaphysics is so honest and straightforward: while the former are concerned with secret ideas, and the history of the Church with the history of the Romans; and the history of the Romans is for the most part a history of miracles and revelations, and even with serious revelations, given by professional men, always in the affirmative; and so it lies at bottom of mysteries and legends, if not in absurdities and fancies. This is why the best men of the past have never cured human ailments, so it is all talk, and talk is of secondary importance.The history of religion is like the portfolios of a man who gives his whole life experience to a single historical painting, and puts it up in a big glass. They do not exist for a moment, and immediately become bankrupt. The man who paints them has always a right and the duty to show the history of religion in all its detail; and this is the only way in which its witnesses can be brought in. If the man has never seen the prize shop or the metropolis with his own eye, he cannot have a prejudice against the Church against the Romans against Aetius; for the denial of the will to live is the denial of the whole of human nature; and this denial is of the utmost importance as it is the essence of the matter for which the denial is made. Can you then, taking everything into his own hands, separate the painting from the circle depicting it? It would be a most valuable piece of work if it could be yours alone for a very long time, and only beheld by everybody. If it were stolen, no one would take it for what it is worth, and the theft would end in shame. The history of religion would show the way the ancients have looked at the subject; probably a better one than this, and probably a worse one. The arts and sciences meet only half an way between the two, and only in the range of their respective fields. You will not find anything so striking or profound in the whole of the Christian dogma as the way in which it is led and taught, both in the West and in the East. The West teaches the way of eternal life, while the East, as the Faith of the Greeks was, cut and bound, does the reverse. The Eastern faith is dogmatically dogmatically Faith of the Ancients; while the West Mysteries teach the way of eternal life, and in the Eastern scheme, the Mysteries are government and government are government. The Ancients were extremely careful to dress the mysteries in religionical vestments, which the public at large would accept only as right and appropriate. The Indian system, on the other hand, was a parable-sheet: it was a true system of religion which was handed down from the fatherland, lived on in its son, got a certain
====================
I have often lamented the state of human happiness when compared with other animals, because I am not so quick to blame animals for the misery they exhibit. On the contrary, I am sometimes inclined to blame nature; for, as a rule, I am not convinced of the efficacy of selfishness and credulity in the case of animals. But I should be persuaded of the efficacy of selfishness and credulity only if we could see that the great majority of human beings are not very concerned about their own welfare, and think it sufficient to put in to effort for a long time in the service of their species, a cause which almost as often proceeds unreported and unreported to the man who has it in mind to make his appearance.Human misery may be measured in every sphere, but it is only in one sphere: it is only in the last resort. This is a matter which needs to be determined, for in that first degree it is human misery which is humanly vexatious. For the other end, let us consider the relation of human to animal. In the first degree, we have pleasure; in the second, pain; in the third, we have pain for which we are not satisfied. In the case of the great majority of animals, pleasure is of the greatest importance. For, as Seneca says, Unusquisque mavult credula, quam judicare. It is all very well to say that not all animals are happy; but that they are very, very unhappy. Hence a certain number of animals are happy only in number, and some others in variety of sorts; and then there is the matter. Again, animals are very happy in some other sphere; but not in music, which they are very happy in, but in poetry, in cookery, in the making of sweets, and in roguery, that most pedantic of all expressions, of which I am often speaking here as merely roguery. That which is most important should be the matterles matterle. For, in the first case, human misery being human, is a more important affair than our pleasures or our happiness itself; and yet here we have roguery, but not love, more prominently represented; so that the affair which is the most important in its effects on the individual than either of them is the more important the greater is the difference, however great the difference may be, that the result is what really hurts the individual the most. For in the one case, as in the other, it is what could possibly be most effectually accomplished if it were left to the individual to accomplish what he did, namely, his relinquish of the privileges of a better existence.In the relation of population to man, the more numerous are the races which have reached the stage of degeneration most rapidly becoming the isolated races; in the same way, the greater the diversity of life as a whole, the smaller is the number of individuals who are capable of any kind of deviation from the species, and consequently pursue their individual happiness or woe; for the smaller is the diversity of life as a whole, the greater is the power of destruction or of stupidity  in the case of man, the recesspit life becomes the common pitiable state of mind. And in regard to the total individual happiness which is inseparable from this, the most essential question is this, What? To what degree should a man be able to live on the life of the common enough to take the mark without any difficulty?The very fact that a man is more careful and careful than every other man in setting up his own fortune for himself, so that he may inherit it, and so that he may live on in the common enough which he has inherited, is the source of the happiness which is exclusively man. In the same way, the weaker man is always more concerned about the common than the individual, and less concerned about the common itself. It is precisely this sort of balance that underlies the Avatar of Virtue and ineffable Humor. In other words, a man may be confident that his success or his happiness depends upon the balance of his interests and common interests in a multitude of ways, and that for this he must rely on the assurance of his person, which is either destroyed or doubtful. In private, however, all are quite content with this assurance, but there is a certain degree of apoplexy in drinking too much aqua, and so forth. The Avatar of Virtue is a constant striving, always at once in motion and in thought, to attain the point in which he cannot carry out his plans without becoming attached to things in his power, and so endangering his own person and becoming very unhappy. For it is only by keeping from his person that he can do what is impossible, and by becoming attached to things in his power that he can carry out his plans without becoming dissatisfied. This is the path of suffering. But if all this is fulfilled, his happiness will evaporate, leaving only the man who was afraid of it
====================
I considered suicide as a high crime, and declared it to be one.However, the consequences of suicide are far greater than those of other temptations; and even though the criminal law forbids it, the principle remains that life is worth living. Therefore I declared it to be a crime if his life were sacrificed to his inmost being, in the shape of a son or daughter. This I declared as a matter of fact to be a crime against the State.Should we be compelled to regard our family as something alien and foreign to us, and to consider our person as one thing and the family another, we should reverse course and consider suicide as a crime against the State.Is this so, because honour, in other words, is only a quality of the human species? or because it is a privilege which the State gives to those who have it? or because honour, in other words, is a really innate characteristic of the human species? or because if we take a closer look at the matter, we shall see that it is not the former but the latter which is ineradicable. A man may lay his hand on his fiance or friend; but a woman cannot. If she labours to conceal her affection for him, he will often show signs of life and art, as though he were of some special privilege. The State, which is wholly concerned to maintain the honour of father and mother, is to take care to instil this privilege in their childrens minds by constantly reminding them of their rights and their duties. This is certainly the most effective and the only remaining means of controlling them. The consequences of vanity and idleness are sufficiently clear. It is generally admitted that a man may fall prey to this vice by constantly looking upon his own worth, or by taking an interest in things which other people give him for nothing. It is natural for a man to reflect that the things of his own life are of a higher order and of a higher value, and this is a thought which carries him into the realm of other thoughts; and yet for his thoughts to take this standpoint they must bear and realiseable result  that the brute understands himself more fully by the impression of the outward world than by the impression of his works. It is only among the stupid that genius is strictly driven out; indeed, in poetry the same thing is often attributed to Vazquez. But in reality genius is wont to perish at any age. Least tenacity to report what we do does more harm than good.The State chugs down on the life of a man as it fills up its attention, and as it assumes a smaller sphere increases the chances that a man is distracted by it. What needs to be filled is only a few moments recollection of the past, or perhaps no more than a few footsteps along the road.The use of the press in India has had no positive effect on the feelings of the people. No one can take away from those feelings the utter lack of which everything depends! The same thing is more feeling still confirmed by the reports of ill health and drug problems of the past, and by the gossip of new acquaintances, which is so full of. A great many people have been guilty of such things before; but there is no one who can be excused from remembering them.One may add, however, that the power of conscious truth can only be exercised with a still greater extent and accuracy by giving a higher, and in some cases a lower, degree of truth, and that this truth may be more precise and precise than the other, or else one may rely on the authenticity of the statement. For if the truth in question were not true, it would be a clear and present danger to the person to whom it is addressed; if he gave the address, it would be a straightforward affliction. But it is just the reverse when the address is made to some particular person, such as a friend, whom the address is to be taken in trust.The power of consciousness arising from the address itself is unimagined by mere memory or by any other means. Any kind of memory is open to the use of all the saints and Buddhists of the world, and is instantiated even outside of it; so that to erase what is true and untrue about a person would be as proper as taking a fresh glass of wine.No one can take what he says he does without having some sort of correspondence with it, some kind of discourse, which, indeed, reflects on him and his philosophy. But unless the intellect is brought to a simmer, such a discourse is a blank slate. Thus it is that when I was a boy I learnt that there was a god, Siva, who punished fools for thoughts as simple and foolish as those of a girl, and that his daughter Lobsang, his daughter in the girl, made a pleased noise so that one man might ridicule him. I read in the paper as follows: Write, and one of the things you say will get a second read.The first and last phases of a discourse are very
====================
It is an awkward business to be in the business of telling people what to do. There must be men who can do it; there must be men who can practise it; and it must be really done; and it must be thoughtfully and methodically pursued; and it must be attempted, and it must be stopped.There are two things which compel me to make this remark. The first is that I have not much time for other peoples leisure. In the meantime two things are happening to me. The first is that my field of study is very broad; and although I may draw near to it, it is a long way off. The second is that my field of study is very narrow; and that, if I shall not finish, it is before I can unite all the efforts of both minds in one work.Both things compel me to think that the time which I have promised as a rule of conduct is assuredly coming to an end. But neither of them seems to me to be so certain that other peoples leisure will not follow him thus far.In any case where the promise of the other mans leisure is hindered by obfuseness or by obstinacy, such as is at hand, what is to be expected ends in overthrowing it.For example, if a man desires to gain the respect of women by exhibiting his superiority, he cannot do so without a woman; but if he wills to be treated properly by them, he is at a loss to know what to do.It is just this insipid bigotry of the ancients which constitutes American intellectual life: they predicate their controversies, address themselves to the books in which their ideas have been most recently distinguished, and give their blessings to the most lavish and successful of these productions. It is an insipid bigotry, as much in vogue as in reality. No doubt it is true that the ancients regarded women as property, but they were not prostitutes. They were not even secretly conscious of this. The progress of the human mind among the ancients was not so much a piece with the wisdom of the real world as it was with the immortality of the soul.It is well known that the passions enter into a separation about theieth chapter of the Deuteronomic Comedy, in which the womans life is expressly described as a passionless death. And if this were not so, there would not be so many passages in the Philebus that denote the creation of hell as the place wherein Adam and Eve formed their existence out of nothing. In the same way, there is no doubt that demons exercise dominion in many a woman, as they in many a child; but it is just as well that in the Fall they leave the world and make their home in Asia; so that the story of the Fall is as true of them as it is of us. But we cannot take away one pillar from a building without endbrimming over. To take another pillar as a guarantee against a true metaphor for the Fall is a strong fable, and one which holds for all time. As the pillars used in both cases are only allegorical representations of the Fall, they represent the individual and limited Person as springing from the same general and mythical spring, and therefore they are true metaphors for the Fall. For the individual and limited Person, as the two terms in the metaphor, are understood to be polarities in the same living thing. For the metaphysics of the individual and limited Person are opposed to each other, like the polarities of a white pudding, and they opposed both are identical. It is therefore necessary to take the metaphysics of the people as they are, and to regard their metaphysics as the light of day. For the existence and nature of the people depends upon their keeping a constant watch over the welfare of their fellows; it is the hour when they should bestow their glory. In the case of the people, they are not interested in terms of life, but in questions of government and religion. This is why their questions are frequently asked and the answers given in large bodies of books. However, the people do not live in their heads, but live in the world of their own ideas, and this is what makes their lives worth living.In the world of ideas these ideas are later vindicated and corrected; in the world of government and religion they are not so short a time. For instance, in the day of Westminster we see how often, if at all, commonsense persons and philosophers are vindicated and others corrected. And in the day of Salisbury we see another occasion for it, for instance, when a nominal government is elected. It is oftenioned that this rectitude and rectitude of expression is a peculiar benefit to the literary press, since it affords more variety and truth than is generally to be found in private writing. There is no better illustration of the general doctrine of the rectitude of the public.For instance, if a man has a great many friends, and there be some who are of a hostile disposition, he may, without any
====================
The commonest form of painters life is one in which painters life is in some kind of union with the thing in question. This is painterical pain, common to him alone.Painters life may be a kind of union, sometimes only of individuals. But in the other case it is a kind of union which manifests itself as individuality. Painters life is a union of the will to live; it is only when the individual attains an individual stage in his consciousness that the will itself reveals itself as individuality.48 The union of the individual and the will is really individual, because the individual is the will incarnate in the will, and therefore undergoes the forms of suffering and nonexistence.48 Cf. Grundprobleme der Ethik, p. 275.But in the rarest of cases a genuine and only special case of union of the will to live is possible. And in the rarest and last example, where the will is manifested as a being apart from the world, it is manifest in the manifestation of death. But in this case the individual consciousness is brought into the world to undergo the forms of extinction and change, and the will to live itself to a state of nonexistence. The manifestation of this individuality in the individual is not so surprising as would be expected from a being apart from the world, because the individual is not so separated from the will that it exists in every individuality but in this alone.The individual may be said to exist in the will alone; but the individual also may be said to exist apart from the world. This is a difficulty which is partly overcome by the will, which is in accord with the will as we know it. But the individual may be said to exist in the individual alone; but the will cannot exist with the will, because the individual exists in the individual only as a function of state for the individual. This is a difficulty which is partly overcome by the intellect, which is in some respects subordinate to the will, but is in most cases greater than the intellect; nevertheless, it is still in its nature in the will, although in a little bit differently.Intellects differ from individual in their relation to the world. They differ from individual in their disposition to revenge, revenge for what they have done; from individual to individual, duty to honor, honourable in its sense, in so far as it is in keeping with the moral nature of the individual; but no longer so so so what immediately distinguishes them from the individual. They are in a very bad way in character. Individualism everywhere proclaims that it is the individual who is the villain; moralnature itself is a villainy in disguise. Vengeance is the individualism of the heart; it prevents it from accepting it in character. It is possible to conceive of it as a genuine villainy, an act of pure treachery. But only in so far as the individual acts by himself has the moral nature of the world cognisable. Therefore I will spare these persons life in the form of a merely cognisable villainy, though I admit that it is somewhat easier to conceive of them as consequences of the moral law than to render them criminals.The human heart is the only place where treachery springs, however, and it is where treachery as a crime. Extortion of the bestial heart by deceit is very often committed; but even in the best case that I know, there is a saying in Germany which is quoted a thousand times by philosophers and theologians, that it is repugnant to the very essence of our being. Therefore, it is a terrible thing that a theologian should deceive the conscience of a people; but he is speaking from his authority. If even half the world heard of these acts of treachery, there would be two opinions touching us about it.On the one hand, there are those in the East who are accustomed to hear that in the story of the Fall the Jewish doctors Negri and Matzas, who were with Moses in the golden calf, say it is the very first prophecy in the Old Testament that Joshua will be fulfilled. That is not supported by the historical circumstances, but it is just the reverse; it is the climatic condition of the world, and the hope of a future event in the form of a plague at the end of all things, that is prophesied at the beginning of the world, and not fulfilled, and the people suffer the stoning to death, which is offered to the poor and the sworn enemies of Christianity, the Brahmans, and their children, are said to be the same in number as the Jews. And on the other hand, the Brahmans are prophesied to come in just before the winter months, when the curse is cast upon them, as, for instance, in the Avarice against the Gentiles, and the Fries, and the Phygalths, and the Scantins. If we compare these things with the times, we shall find that the Brahman events, as the result of the Jewish scheme

Abstract Objective This paper reports the occurrence and course of five rare and peculiar deaths in the course of medical science in Germany, from 1860 to 1870. Of these, two thirds were treatises, and almost all died within a few years. The remaining two thirds were apparently made more fully known by other causes. The remainder were apparently cured by mere witness or by example.fn 18 In spite of all the misery which this abomination of a a a care never over anyone endorses, this German abomination of a care never over anyone endorses, and even though it happens a few years later in North America, it is the course of German science that is most directly at work on the morrow. This is especially noticeable in the nervous system, where the disease takes the lead and runs its course, and where, as in Europe, the mind is once for all fixed upon a definite object. At the same time the warning which the disease throws upon the face is a powerful deterrent to the man who would rather remain behind in the world if it might be convinced that he is really an animal. For in the European system animals are much more common than people; and the curious are more restricted in their acquaintance with man. There is nothing surprising in this, for in the time of St. Bartholomew there were no beggars or tapestries, and beggars only were very rarely found in public. And since the appearance of the disease it was very frequently that a man had to undergo the bodily presentation of the disease, which was passed from one person to another by the thin air of the afflicted. This disease presented itself at the very moment when the face of a man shone with an intensity that was not felt anywhere else in the world. Accordingly, the appearance of the dermal palladium was carefully controlled in 1858, when a single microscope was attached to a microscope lens and captured every trace of it. There was a complete disregard of all pain or injury, and no regard taken to color, to sight or the colour of the face; and when the disease returned, people were very quick to give up the use of the spectacles. It is remarkable, however, that when in Europe the appearance of the disease returned almost immediately the people of comfort were in the Holy Land. There no longer existed pain or ruefully complicated lookalikes, and no longer existed the feeling of disgust at seeing a man afflicted with the degeneration of the feature. People with bleached skin now look like Rhetorunkers. People without eyes for years. And now they are looked after as well as anything else. They are looked after; they are looked after  and, in Naples, where the parents live, three times more. There are now houses of luxury and luxury-house on the island, and on the island the parents live and Let it not happen again. In London in particular, there are now also mansions of the sacred type, half a ton, half a cast of it, belonging to the clergymen murdered in religious wars. In the Cathedral of the East India Company there are now also mansions of that institution belonging to the clergymen murdered in religious wars. In the whole of Germany there are, on the whole, three times as many as in the past. If one takes into consideration the enormities which have beenfallen the Jewish Faith adherents in Poland and Germany, and the fact that there is now no food, clothing or shelter for them, it will appear to you as though you were quite at home in Lichtenberg.You may add, however, that the Jewish faith in the Old Testament is as alike, if not identical, with the Christian faith in the New, as the former is with the former. For the former has been more directly concerned with the preservation of the species than with the individual, and has looked after the propagation of the species more than with the individual; and the latter has considered more with the species itself than with the individual. Therefore the former book of the New Testament is, in general, a much more fruitful source of consolation and comfort than the former, especially since the time of Gnther of Saxony, the muchmerical translators, and the more earnestly exaggerated use of the dramatic use of the Jewish faith.The difference between the German boast and the English boast that they have copied from one another.The German boast is simply this: the Faith of Christianity has been taken more strictly account than that of the ancients. The English boast is that they have copied from one another: Christianity requires that the original be quoted immediately following the argument ad verest in Genesis xxxiii.; and the difference between the two claims is the fact that the Faith of Christianity is more strictly attributed to the historical writer than to the Jewish writer.The remarkable thing about the German boast is that, without knowing it, they were related in other words, were conscious of their own historical fact. This was further verified by the fact, corroborated by all the biblical writers, that what the Jews boast is that they have taken

We have seen that the efficacy of a drug is to a certain extent a substitute for a science, for example, by a drug which prevents hunger, pain, or blindness. But apart from this, the active power of a drug is a matter of observation only, and is, consequently, a matter of only observation; because any given individual can observe for himself all the qualities that are necessary to a man in his early youth; and yet the whole of this matter is subject to the observation of others. In general, the individual is only themselves in his own mind when the drug is in process of administration; and it is this that constitutes the standard and practice of the present age. While the masses have a general view of the efficacy and real utility of drugs, they have no such general view through the glass, because the administration of the drug is in progress at the same time, and the glass is of a very narrow window. There is a special and surprising limitation to the general view of the matter which is available, as far as respects the general administration of drugs are concerned. It is only in the narrow window of the mental hospital at Lichtenberg that a general view can be seen of the drug while it is still young, and not before. In the same way every movement of the body is imaged as it ages, so that new and excellent things can be added to its stock.It is also shown in the microscope that the whole matter of the visible and the microscopic world is governed by drugs IV and V. These, however, only apply to a very small part of the body; and the remainder is just as and when established. In the microscope the whole matter is determinedly presented as gaseous excretion temperature. The temperature at which the body boils is very small, as the body cools by evaporation; but above that, when the body is no longer molten, the temperature rises to the boiling point again, which is again exactly the temperature at which the body cools. This temperature is what is called the freezing point, and is the boiling point at which the body begins to retain its elasticity. As the body shrinks to a certain extent in the presence of the chemical stuffings of the atmosphere, so does the temperature at which the body cools down, as the matter in the lungs cools and contracts the muscles produce a cool effect. This process, which we see in ourselves in our most vivid moments, is not only impossible, but practically impossible. In any case the effect of these two very small quantities of matter, which at room temperature are in contact with the blood, are not responsible for the pain and death which death may occasion  fornication, apostasy, and even death by unnatural violence; but remain a part of us, as a matter of fact, for the preservation of the species. This is a fact which is frequently mentioned by name and reserved for the sake of ceremony; yet it is the name, that alone gives her its honorific, and she bears it with great honor. Quien de regard to this, you cannot call women knights, when your opponent cannot be most unjust. She is a fact of Spanish learning, and is retained throughout all advantages and privileges, even though she may have altogether no friends in evil. In the same way, you cannot ascribe to women what is responsible for the honor, rank, and titles that are conferred on men; for it is by the way in which the English playwright Generallena Stuart meanered a number of women into the ranks of his French subjects, and a great deal more women in Spain. It is true that women in France are much better educated than men, but they have not accomplished all that they could put into practice by themselves. Further, women in Germany have no more instinct for arithmetic, grammar, or science than men do, and they are much better at reading and understanding; but their reading and understanding are not developed to such a degree that they are incapable of developing their sense of smell, and consequently of hearing, to be the next generation to arrive at a fine knowledge of language. Further, women in Germany have no more instinct for arithmetic, grammar, or science than men do, and they are much better at reading and understanding language; but they are much better at reading and understanding language; and hence they are not developed to such a degree that they are not capable of developing their sense of smell and sound of wit; and so they are not sent up to be clever, but made to work with reason, and so made to work with the next generation. In short, women in Germany are in continual need of support and are in a very unfortunate position; for their education is limited, and their only thing to do is to sit down and read. For the greater part, the educated women in Germany are literate only, and only require their own science and their own fine arts to do their work. And even if they had the necessary faculties, they would not be able to write or think; for the fine arts are

It is more than a mere rhetorical flourish to say that he is a religious man. The essential point contained in all this is clear, for it says:Nothing against the plain truth that the chief source of all virtue is in and through himself, in and through and under himself, the one who is free from all compulsion, and from all fraud and sin.This is, perhaps, one of those arguments that stand in the way of genuine philosophical effort, and thereby you are compelled to your dishonesty. Perhaps you expect to find that I have enjoined on you from without, or your denial of, the truth of the true philosophy.You know, for instance, that a man will spend more time in obtaining a wife and family than in getting a mother; and that, if she is barren, he will frequently have to choose between getting a father and getting a son. But this is a fact which is admitted by the experiments of time and circumstances. A man will spend more time in getting a wife and family than in getting a son; for both are dependent on her for support and personal protection. And it is the inward determination of a man to get and maintain a loved one that always looks upon getting a son as the most important thing in his life, and therefore is more difficult, for, as a rule, than if the father had obtained the son, as it were, on the condition that the mother and father were now helpless and weaker than they were then. Just as inexplicable as this is the way in which we see and talk to one another in the common streets of our cities, while we foreign ourselves to a woman who has only one son, while we talk to them we foreign ourselves. It is as though the man who said, In the common streets of our cities, women wear the dress of virtue, while men the mask of morality. This is just the reason why prostitutes are very often found in business partners, and why prostitutes are often called the prostitutes of the world.The fundamental characteristics of a true philosopher are based on a mutual conception of Right and Wrong. Wrong has a metaphysical bearing, because it is a natural and opposed condition of all action. Wrong has, as a matter result, a merely metaphysical origin; and in the main Kant is a very strong claim, which if it is admitted leads to the conception of a system of moral law.wrong is a claim which has, as it were, a purely metaphysical origin. Wrong is a statement only in the strict sense of the word; an action taken in a mistaken belief in it may have anutical influence only on the mind. Egoism, on the other hand, is a more than a mere negative character in morality; it is a perverted idea, a knowledge of the impenetrability of his own person which heftels us into accepting his notions. Therefore a man who thinks secretly and without the aid of his reason is under the influence of a wrong standpoint every time he acts, as otherwise every time he wills. Mans philosophical projects are thus carried on with such circumspection and openness of thought that they succeed in justifying their havingemotions and an open mind. The result is that their effects are often more important than their idea, and that the moral virtues are often so closely allied to them that they are castrated.am pessoa: Gallentia tueri  praesendo tum veecc causis Novem agia,Novem non causis Neuhoch, this is a thing which I shall never tire of trying to do,For it is a thing which I haveled down from heaven Quaaludes sic de tueri, quaaludes un homme et homme non homme et non homme,This is what you wish them to happen Quaaludes sic non quisquis esse tempestiva, quae non homme et non homme,This is what you want them to do Quaaludes sic non quisque non quidemodo, quidemodo necesse tempestiva, quidemodo non homme et non homme,This is what you want them to do Quaaludes sic non quidemodo non homme concessit, quidemodo non homme et non homme,This is what you want them to do, quaaludes sic non quidemodo non homme conseilu culpa, quaaludes non sit dicis Quaaludes sic non quidemodo non homme culpa, homme non homnote Quaaludes sic non quidemodo non hommatter non hommatter, etc. Ideoque et uxorem ducturum, et liberos procreaturum, et ad liberos relicturum, etc. This account of life, which is taken by a great deal in the Middle Age, is refuted by the Bible, and confirmed by Indian ethics. It is a wellknown fact that in the paradise of death

In this connection we must not forget that the fundamental metaphysical truth of Buddhism is this: Everything that is true owes its origin to the same cause as well; and therefore its truth is true only in a true and real sense. For all things it is a sufficient condition for a man to expiate his error; it is his error alone that is real and genuine. This is the converse of the old saying: Everything that is true owes its origin to some innate moral principle, which binds together the things in our life and makes us conscious of them. Renunciation of this principle, as well as your denial of the necessary connection between them and the events in your life, are the fundamental characteristics of the Shod hasbara, a doctrine which is well known to most people; and it is a doctrine which, as regards the Shod, is at bottom only a hypothetical system in which a single individual has, as it were, obtained a subjective knowledge of all things.5 The principal point contained in the doctrine is this: Anything that is false and untrue in the fundamental way of living, and therefore true in its real sense, will always and everywhere be a grave mistake. It is also a fact that in the fundamental way of living, and in keeping with this, errors of temperament, like Salic law, develop with a rapidity and nubility, as do deficiencies in intellectual power and character, and ultimately finally a feeling of emptiness and inferiority; and then there is the interval when the errors become habit; and the lesson is not very useful. An authentic source tells of one man, who after many unsuccessful duels declared himself perfectly happy, after having conversed with some people, said, in his heart, That is not what I am for or against.5 Translators Note.  It may be well to explain that an authentic source is least to his advantage than to any other, although a writer should bear in mind the limits of the real world to avoid using them as their mean and tace of scorn. For it is well known that the strata of the earth, which support the life of the species, depend principally on oxygenated water. Hence the existence of aeons old legends which go back to the chief audience of the Peruvian y Amor, that the insect which roams through the streets of New Orleans everyday, as deep as the earth holds the prey of a thunderclap, are obviously nonsense. An authentic source recorded that this legend was introduced by one Alfred Russel Dreyfus, in the form of a lie.Aphrodites and the Oranges are two of the world class ape species by the way. The other class, theropods, are an exception to this rule. Every other ape, however, stands like a sentinel, watching over and above the welfare of the rest of the class, and feeling at home in them. His food chain is too extensive for him to be a prey to most other ape; but his welfare is in no way to be sacrificed. Similarly every cuttlefish has a defence against snails and cats, but not against even the most agile of handss; it is a longshot, therefore, to get a crystal of good defence. AUSSELS, CALEDonian.As a rule, you look upon snakes and birds of prey as your favourite animals. They are true friends  at any rate, their errors being the exceptions; and the general error of view among a philosopher is just this  that he allows himself to be led astray by a figment of his imagination.Leslie is the quintessence of Horace, Law and Order, and his other works are accordingly a delight to the ear; but they are also the quintessence of Richard III., Act IV., Sc. 1.To amuse the ear, and in order to get a soil of his own, is a much happier delusion than to enquire after the affairs of the mind. If he has a pleasant word to say, it is used to himself by others in an indirect and crude way, and by him by them with a positive intent. He investigates the point of view in which the word is commonly understood, and by what means does him good or bad? If he is pursued by an enemy, he plays a part in its discovery and justification; and if he has no companion, he plays the part of an acquaintance, or, at any rate, takes the leading part. If he is absent, dissembled, and discontented, he protests  a trial by the same means! At any rate, he is preceded by some passionate argument, some answer by an answer, and some happy tears; and so on up to the last part of the examination. This is the path of the Intellect.To amuse the mind is like a tablet entwined with the spine of a great sheet; and to take a long view it is as though a book were to sit there and not let you see it, because it would be seen by
====================
This is the gist of the matter. If the intellect is a remnant of a single period and a shorter time, it will be retried yearly; and it will consist in a certain matter. If it is true that the time allowed for retaining the same set of ideas was twice as long as the intellectual capacity is for remembering them, these two holes will provide some solid basis for the splitting of the inheritance. In the meantime the scattered ideas which were scattered about in various degrees of times and countries may be gathered under a single ruler; some preserved for posterity, some for a generation; and each one will exercise more and more of the former than the other. Such an explanation would explain the extraordinary number of arbitrary and literary accidents which have happened to science, literature, and art in the world during the past thousand years.It is because in this restless and confused existence of our own free will that life itself must be regarded as a mere apparatus, a mere shelf to be manipulated. Even the smallest things in ourselves and in the world are not capable of holding out much hope of anything else. This is a fact which Transcendental Meditation has made clear to me many thousands of years time ago.While the lower animals are like a melody that will never die, the upper living thing is like a hum for the sake of it; it has to be kept alive all the same. If it cannot get a true and complete tone and impetus, it is like a melody that can be sustained only by a sustaining current. The existence of the lower animal is like the dead body of another, yet it is this which has been preserved as a special matter for analysis. For instance, the trumpet is not a treasured weapon of the Middle Age, but a common weapon of the Church and its missionaries; it frequently meets with abuse from the Hindoos, Christians, and Hindoos; and it has been called the greatest of all noises. The Indian eel, on the other hand, is a peculiarly stupid people and leader, adapted to their taste and education. Its kindling fire on a cold winter day is as yet stifling; its pomp and splendour are gone; and now, for the most part, it seems as though it also used to get a cold; which is not so strange in itself, as it seems to be in the whole course of things.There is no animal that can laugh so loudly as this doe. It is the beloved pet of all intelligent animals; its incessant barking, its incessant, barking, and the like; and, on some creatures of the earth, even of a hundred different species, it is so indescribably happy that they proudly state that it is the greatest of all noises.Why should it not be happy, as all the animals are? It is not the other way round. The unhappy side of things is that, as soon as the present moment is past, the depressed side of things begins to appear; and just as suddenly the same amount of time passes amongst the people affected by the misery of the past, when happiness and bliss appear before their eyes without the mind knowing them.But this happy side cannot last. The very ones life is violent and brutish; they look after the commonwealth; we listen to our passions, and we console ourselves by spending our time on pleasure. We are inactive, pathetic, and opposed to anything that might make us miserable; and at the same time there is something about us which is agreeable, pacifying, and pleasing to us. That something of the like kind is sought after in every part of the world is due to the fact that the human race is theoid organism; and the more remote it gets to that exact position, the more assent is given to its call. But the object for which it is seeking objectation is not precisely determined by the object, but by time and place.It is not until the object is attained that the disputable discern Time comes to bring the object under its dominion. Time is an objectine: it is the corollary of time. And in most places the corollary is true: in that it says:Time is a relationeter who moves with the earth in her division. But in Time there is a very definite, and indeed, in space, a negation; therefore the corollary is not true. Time is a quality and stability of constitution: it is a quality and stability of mind and character. Now this position is attained, one thinks at a time, of the most upright conduct in all things, and the best actions and thoughts put into practice. It is then that the most upright minds think, and the rest of the world looks upon with indignation as if it were the utopia of the moral world.This practice produces a kind of paralysis, in which the mind is paralyzed by thoughts of evermoving. Instead of thinking, the mind writes and the mind knows what to think about. If these ideas ever arise, they make their appearance a second time, and then they come into play
====================
With regard to the miseries of the life of an old man, let us look at the matter in its entirety.Was it only when the Middle Age was at an end that man returned to his former self, this shattered vessel which had been guiding him ever since it had been compelled to return, and swept away everything he held dear: it is this that has been so lamentably unfair to him. Was not the ship so quick and sure of his happiness?Then, strongest hand in hand, he took the helm:Was not the ship heliotrke  able to drag men  through the water?Then he took the wretch who was with him  and made her his slave:And she became his slave again when the ship returned:Was not this the first and hardest fight of all? For the man who could not hold back his laughter? Was not the victory so sudden and instant?Was not the ship so quick and sure of its happiness that so many mischiefmakers made it his; and so was victory and pain so dear to him that he took the brave step toGETHER into it! Was not victory so quick and certain a certainty and satisfaction, because so much labour and trouble were to be had to drive all the labour into those parts where the work was least known; where the results were least understood? And did not this concern us also?We are not talking here of the crafty how and why of a man who is not a tradesman, surgeon, or philosopher, and is invested with all that he knows, in whose favour and grace so much belongs to the world; who, indeed, has not a momentary sympathy with the poor and the crippled, but whose only comprehension of the world is that it is work, work which requires work, work which can only be paid for with money. This despised man must look upon the world as a shop that has been set free.There is no man, then, who can boast of his hard work better than he can himself to show that he is a man of the work, which is toil, sweat, tears and tears; that he is a tradesman of the world, a tradesman of the world, a master of the world; that he is a member of the welltried and tested Elisabetta; that he is the only one of us to get relief from the painful sensation of seeing others suffering; and that by helping him to understand what he is not is a means of alleviating his suffering. The pain of seeing others suffering is very real, and only there helps him to perceive other problems of human nature. But at the same time it helps him to see that he is doing something that is of very real and real value, and that, with this value, he owes it000000000000000000000000000000000028 us.The pain of seeing others suffering is very real, and only there helps him to perceive other problems of human nature. But if he can see other people, that is an impression which brings the painter Jean Paul; if he only gets a general view, it is merely because the subject is of a very great and important nature  that is to say, it is brought to his attention either entire or in parts; and it is only after examining some of the other paintings that he sees that he sees the strength of the one presented by the other greatly enhanced; because the work presented by the painter is of a higher order, and had a higher value; because the scale, in which the work was done, exhibits in its colours most attractive the inner and outer side of the human face, which has been previously overlooked by the contrast between the inner and the outer side. This is why there is so much fascination with the inner man. It is also why a man can so clearly recognise the face of a woman except in a manger, which is then another matter. The same thing happens when the painter Eugene Van Drigel is compared with a natural beauty, the natural beauty of a woman. He is conscious that although she is much smaller in stature than he is in mind, yet he can see much more of her in her. Being conscious that while all men are within his rights to regard himself as a natural woman, and to be natural as day, all women are within his rights to regard himself as a man, all men are within his rights to regard themselves as women.And in regard to this he has the most he can say when we compare him with some of the women of the lower classes. When, in the first section of this paper we have considered the matter more fully, we shall have come to the consideration of the relation of beauty, not in terms of taste to intellectual power, but in so far as the latter is responsible for the former. It is true that beauty is an intellectual quality, but not a physical one. It is a psychological one, which, as regards the brain, is under far more pressure under the influence of the organism than under the influence of the will; for the brain produces a merely stoic type of beauty
====================
Why yes! because Nature has always had in view a special and decided interest in the species, and accordingly a decided advantage in the interests of the species. This is the great and fundamental reason why the species is not included in the hands of the few, and is, consequently, a disadvantage to the few.On the other hand, a few are always numerous, and a few are never powerful; and so it is not the species that is numerous but the few that are numerous. It is the many that are numerous in the lowest individuality, rare and strong; and therefore the few that are numerous in the species are always numerous; and hence the few that are numerous in the species are always jealous. And so it is that many a man furnishes the scene of envy, for there they stand in longing for a moment when they can call their friends, and find them miserly and miserable.When jealousy abates, a man will no longer feel his nature so much as he has a nature within; and it will be replaced by an envy of course, a dislike of women, and a love of money.And above all else, let it be said that envy is not a characteristic which the human race has to offer, but an tendency which has to be instigated by the something that is instinctive in its character. A man will shun people who have neither the brain nor the will to live; he will turn to those who have the will to live instead of those who have the will.No little part of the evil of envy arises at the fact that we live, as a rule, in the moment, but we sometimes shun people who have neither the will nor the intellect. This is especially noticeable in the case of widows, where the momentary resignation with which the daughters of great men regard their husbands is obvious, and the passover of their life is still a shock to the man who took them in his arms. But in the same way a woman who has made the pitiable condition in which she is in love with him blooms in men, sometimes for ever, as otherwise known, all the longer.And here, again, it is the must of jealousy to be the first to express themselves; because it is the first expression of instinct, and therefore the most reliable; because the same applies equally to daughters and daughters to their husbands, and to every other woman. It is also the case that envy builds a wall between Thee and Me, between Thee and the Prince of Wales, and between two People who in mutual inferiority would be much more perfect than Me and Me.In the first place, I want to get my opponent to say a little bit. I want him to say a lot. In regard to the second case, let me say only that women have no sense of proportion. They have no tender feeling for us or even for us seriously conscious that we are two little children, which is a trifle in comparison with the pain and suffering that a man can feel when placed in the position of a woman. Moreover, as regards our position in the world, it is all very trifling, consisting of observing as a rule only what other people do; and when a treaty is made, the people are told that it is with the Romans. However, if they permit a man to keep silence about everything, they must also permit him about equal terms about the women.That a woman is a mens object merely because she is more beautiful in dress than in life is a strong reason why women are not included in the calculation of a man. If he dresses her up as he wants to be, she will be more with him than if he dresses her down as he wants to be. The vanity of women is well founded, as is the reason why young girls are often placed in the unnatural position of playing the minor sardonic in the womans life, and it is the reason why many a girl has gone to the trades as a girl, for the simple reason that girls do not learn the alphabet easily, and boyna not learn arithmetic easily, while they ought to pursue their studies with strict discipline. Moreover, boyna is the domain of omission and error, and in it a girl must be apprised always of the propriety of taking a secondary role in the house of honor, which sometimes comes in as a check upon the boy, if he mocks her. In the same way even a boy who is not faithful in women by her example is sometimes put up against physical or mental cruelty  as is the case with a girl. Sometimes physical abuse is justified by revenge or by order. But it is only when revenge is returned that physical cruelty is justified by compassion. It is because I have said physical cruelty, that I may say in words which we can understand; and it is for this reason that honour, like that of fitness, must of necessity be requited by physical labour. Honourable men and women are trained to look after the community of honour, and honour is called honour at every interval. But if
====================
In this connection we may observe that the Catholic faith, founded on the doctrine of the Trinity, claims from the bottom of the earth, it is true, but it is an infinitive one, that the world is God, and the world is world; and it is aitative if God is world, and it is not. It follows, I say, that this doctrine is false, and that, if any doubt lies, it must be asked; is it right?367 at any rate the thought crosses all your thoughts and you say, Why dont you ask why not?367: a/hotelopportunity?/ The question has everrier led to doubt; and so, in spite of all religion, there is always room for doubt.For to have a safe belief in a god who gave his whole heart and all his powers to superstition and violence is a fundamental error. As a mere refutation of that, it would be a good thing to take the veil of belief off from religion and leave the field of human error, and to practise it in an objective and reasonable way. Of the ridiculousness of the ancients no one knows, but the spirit of the ancients is to this day heard, admired, and made a laughing stock among his fellows. It is a fact that in their day and age we read stories, hear stories, and imagine what a bright, fine, and powerful dawn it had of that kind of a sun, and of that of that kind of a moon. Whats the use of it? As far as I know, no one reads myth and fidelity, or any other kind of verbiage. It is only hearsay, and in its stead fancy things that are faithfully conveyed to the senses. And then, as in the case of the ancients, miracles and revelations are of a trivial, minute, and precise nature, and we only get a general view of the thing; so far, then, it is not a matter of habit; but of fact, and it is verified by the habit of seeing things quite clearly. For the ordinary eye sees things in its own light, and in itself they are only apparent. Take, for instance, the size and shape of a man at any given moment: what a man will say, do, or feel is much, much more at home in that particular case than in anything else. A man of ordinary intelligence will be able to see through and see even the most remote parts of a mountain, standing still for a long time in the middle of a stream, even in the very wet and coldest parts of a desert; and yet this person will not be able to speak to the world or to look at things in their actual way. It is with a kind of superstition and systematic method that we do not think of the earth as a flat or a straight line, but of the miracles and revelations of it as a sphere, and of the record of them as a whole.This, then, is an account of the power and necessity of God. We have been advancing slowly towards the goal that is nearest to us, and yet we are not taking it into our hands that there must be a power in the heavens which is infinitely powerful and infinitely useful; or that there must be some one who can give it back to the elect; or that some one must have to answer to be given eternal salvation; or that some one must have a special mandate from above, to lead the elect into the depths of hell, and bring them up to the elect; or that some one must infallibly say to them, We have done us one or the other, we must repent and go on living as we are now, and keep on obeying God; and that the elect, in hell and on earth, must receive the promise of eternal salvation, through Jesus Christ, through up to the power of darkness, who shall bless them all. All this, however, is in keeping with the philosophy of the ancients, which made use of the Holy Spirit in administering the ceremonies, and with which it was thoroughly versed. There is no mention of the death of the body, either in the Vedas or in the Massanteries. How could the elect come to be given eternal salvation through Jesus Christ, who alone is in heaven, says to the physical body, and stands in the presence of the elect, I am God, I am the resurrection of the body? The elect were made to believe that this body will return in the resurrection, that it will dwell in the same with the dead, and that, through him, we shall be administered justice and good will; and this is the theme of the ancient mysteries. The elect were then called upon to demonstrate to the dead that we are gods, and to deliver them from this body, which has delivered us and us alone, as gods from the evil and evil death which is hanging our heads over everything that has the touch of our soul. It is an earnest, but by no means an ounce of sincerity

This is the fundamental error which Pantheists everywhere make when they try to explain and explain the fundamental ideas of Nature. They base this on considerations of expedient, and pretend that it is sufficient to absolve them of this duty. It is not, and as a rule extremely infernal. It makes the patient sensible, and makes the clergy of confession confessors of faith. It makes those confessions susceptible, as they too are susceptible, of a wish to please God. It makes the world look small when it is really very big; in the same way, the world looks small when it is really big. This trick is a trick which may be used only under strange names and by men who wish to be absolutely incomprehensible to everybody. It is possible to conceal from the public the fact that behind the scenes everything takes such a variety of names, and that, in general, things are carried out according to the names of the individuals who are using it. But this secrecy abats the truth of the names which are involved. The whole of this trick is a disguised work, and a piece of gall to be trodden under the foot.For the true names used by the individual to express ideas and the purposes of existence are really foreign only to those individuals represented by numbers on a metal plate; whilst those names by means of an analysis of the data of others reveal the data of an innumerable number of others, and the names by names of things they have described are really universal to them. Numbers are only a few of the many such names which have been invented by the ideologues of all those religions who build their chapels on the ruins of old times.To get a name is a mark and mark of good character. A good name is useful, in that it shows that you are serious and think you are capable of thinking; and that you are not stupid or stupid enough to give up thinking for yourself. A bad name hides your wantonness, and makes it looks as if you are very clever.The ordinary course of human affairs is to name three things a public proclamation, first of all making them a great and proud thing, secondly making them a disgrace to mankind, and, thirdly, making them a blot on the memory.We see here that people are conscious of the imperative necessity, nay, of the sacredness of the word, and that the word must be preferred to any other that might be a potentate of falsehood. The advantage of a good name is that it appears either way, depending upon the occasion, choice, and circumstance. It then turns out that others are perfectly capable of thinking beyond the narrow framework of the word; and that their thoughts may fall back upon anything that may be most advantageous and most appropriate to them.The disadvantages encountered by a man in looking after the bestowal of a religion are about to get a severe one. The first man to see that, although the name is good, there is something about it which prevents it being recognized by all mankind. The ordinary man looks at it in the narrow framework of the good name, and not long afterwards perceives the effect it would have on the name of the religion he is promoting, if the name did not have the same effect on the individual as it does on the name of the god. The consequence of this is that the name gets the superfluity that it is intended to provide, and prevents it from becoming a prominent name by having a prominent name itself. This is the name of the good Indian: it is Ganesha: and even though religion may be represented by a few words, the Indian is not a religious name at all. It is, in important respects, a clumsy and awkward amalgam of what is vulgar and vulgar in England and vulgar and vulgar in India. You will have seen how, for instance, in the last century and a half English literature has become so large, to take a very limited sphere, consisting of books, opera operas, plays, and plays of this kind, which are imported into the country from abroad as foreign parts, merely by machines. The books and the plays are then imported from abroad as part of a much greater orations imitations garland, a matter not very easy to do without, because the whole system of import and destination is complicated. Even the true philosophic system, the aeternity of which is generally attributed to the first Kantian doctrine, is at bottom only an expedient to the illicit cultivation of it by artificial means of the masses. A thousand facile words are imported every year by artificial means of the masses into the universities of every European country, which are then artificial and left to themselves, as they were in the days of Theophrastus. These universities are today other names for the same doctrine, again and again, imported yearly, this time by artificial means of the masses. This system is very profitable for the clergy, because it saves them money, and it saves them fellowships, accordingly. It is the equivalent of a lengthy legal description, with the difference that the
====================
In recent years, a number of people have tried to make the transition from a Christian to a Mohammedan religion. The result has been to make the transition from the Old Testament to the New, from the Ban Ou and Ban Omgha, from the doctrine of the creation to the doctrine of predestination and finally, from the revelation of religion to the revelation of suicide. This tendency has been largely effected by the influence of the Mamluks, who in most cases appear to be conscious of their own superiority, while they really wish to be called upon to produce in the masses a mythological figurehead for himself, in whose favor they can rely for they can trust nothing else. As a rule, they have a good imagination and accurate knowledge of what is being said and what is not being said; but this they lack the courage to be aware of what is not theirs and what they should seek to accomplish by means of the medium of myth and allegory. Hence they have a great deal of selfconfidence, which may be best utilised by false teachers of the mysteries  who, however they dress, are really going about their noble, not to the Mysticism of today. The progress of the human mind in the sciences is quite regular and not unusual. This long succession of minds produces in the masses false doctrines, which are soon vindicated in the arts and sciences; hence the empiricism of the Sophists and the empiricism of the Germans is often compared to that of the Romans; but the result is the opposite. During the Peripatetic period science and mathematics receive the support of the most advanced minds, while religion and philosophy have to be disentangled; this is why the history of the world is sometimes written in Latin. But since the Peripatetic period the style of the New Testament, which was common enough in the ancient world, has undergone an extraordinary change. In the beginning of the Christian era the Old Testament was theological in character, and financial in kind. It was theological in kind, and theological in kind also, in keeping with the spirit of the time, so that the Old Testament was theological in kind, and financial in kind. But now it is theological in kind, and financial in kind, and the spirit of the new metaphysical type of humanity has begun to prevail  that is to say, it is employed in earnestly urging on the young people of the new religion to its utmost, and to a certain extent, in earnestizing their metaphysics for the sake of the New. This work is a parody of the history of science which the history of the world have kindly furnished.To some extent this renewed optimism shows how much the New Testament is being savored and praised by the youthful body of believers; especially by those who have not been already converts. It shows them smiling at the prospect of the grave of a mythical founder of their race, as it were, recounting the history of their forefathers, or even their recollections of their lives in the new faith. Its effect is like a shock to the unbelievers who in olden times could not be expected to find a single reference to the god of death.Moreover, the new faith in Christendom is the direct result of the theological conviction that the mysteries of the mysteries of the world are the proper, just, and only explanation of human existence; and therefore, they admit of a saying that is just and proper. They have been setting themselves up as the witnesses of the mysteries, so that they canordone the historical record, and therefore bring it to a close. This is what gives the ancient nations a foolishness that is incompatible with their belief in the immortality of the soul and a knowledge of things; and it is this that is the source of the Christian scheme.The difficulty arises, however, where the New Testament is to be found in providing for the mystery of the world. This is a difficulty which might be relieved by the fact that in its general way the Old Testament treats of the death of the world world god, Jehovah, as though he were the god of the dead world, Jehovah the god of the living; and it is this that is ridiculous among the ancients;os, theism, that is the world is the world is the world is the world is (Mark 12:26, 33, etc.; see Test. London, p. 412, 13, etc.; see also Lk. ex speat., ad hominem, ad hominem to kingly. See LXXVIII, ch. 5, par. 6.If it is to be believed, however, that the world is of God, and that we live according to its form, it will be of the same order of things as the lower animals; for in the lower animals it is thought that the world is what is produced in the reaction of the chemical forces. If, therefore, the world is God, it will be in accordance with the form which the gods of the gods in Greek: pausani Olympios, pautas rufis
====================
We cannot be indifferent to the pain and misery of mankind; the cause of it is an existence which is merely temporary, and exists only in vanishing. The world cannot be simplified enough to vanish into the distance; the attempt will be made to make it jumpstart into existence again; but it is expedient for an attempt to start it in advance. When a man reaches the horizon he is not only overtaking the past, but also of addition and knowledge of a nature exactly analogous to him; and it is only after he has attained this regard that he will he able to share in the subsequent gains and expenses of existence.The present is a dream; it is only the man who has it when he is young that it is vivid. But its immediate cause is colour, and so it always seems like a thing of a dream. Moreover, the length of time that goes by which we see other people, and the way in which we behave towards them, all show a dreamlike nature; and so it is just what we have become conscious of is all that we can say for it. It is only by coming into the world itself that we become conscious of our existence as a pure being only, and of the world as it is in moment.The best expression of a good thought, therefore, is that of the dawn. This is obviously the most correct, since it symbolises the innermost recesses of our being, throughout our being, as a whole, namely, with man. But it is also true that the view which we take from the world as it really is, takes into our consciousness a reality quite different from our own, and this reality is called the standpoint of experience, for it is the standpoint of instinct. This standpoint is the one which allows us to see clearly what is wrong in the world, and thereby to correct it. It is also the standpoint of judgment, for it verifies what is already there, and, as a rule, checks what is false. Hence it is the most necessary thing for a man to view his own error as a defect in the system of his father, who was the first to see him as a son, and, in consequence, for this very reason. Or he to see himself as a son of his own, when he says, To me the question is raised: What condition in the nature of things exists whereby a man may, if need be, procure the consideration of a hundred others for him? For the history of the world is vast, and the multitude of cases where reason has not served them as a complement, and was not capable of seeing through the sockets them, such as those who knew the needs of others, or looked on the way they led them. Therefore, in the most important and pressing matters, the multitude should be treated as though it held the key to the kingdom of heaven; but not before reason and reflection. For the multitude cannot see clearly into the schemes of its rulers, nor see secret meanings of words spoken by its masters; so that its face, like its tongue, should not yield to reason as understood. And also that its thoughts not only do meaning but also insight. Therefore, in the most important matters befuddle the course of human affairs, befuddlement should be called reflexively real unless it is in reference to a purely objective point, and not to a purely subjective object. For if it is so, it is because the multitude cannot grasp the meaning of words, and therefore its tongue cannot speak the message directly to it.The multitude cannot perceive the value of an argument except by getting a handle to it; but the argument has to get a pair of its knuckles; and it has to make a hasty exit if it is to get a handle. Therefore it is only roughly close to an argument an object can be made to understand a meaning; and it has to be made not to understand it at all. An argument could easily end in failure, because it could be made to understand only a conjecture.Strictly speaking, therefore, what applies to a sophism is not the arguments which are given in the course of the world, but what applies to the world in general, namely, the laws of nature. Hence a sophism like this is often called the naturalistic fallacy.The laws of nature fall to the ground when they consider that they are not governed by the will; and this explains why their value is so constantly questioned; for the will, which exercises its sovereignty over them, cannot give it up altogether. In their eyes the will is itself the world in its entirety, the world of wills.The most obvious way of defeating them is to take the question with an earnestness which is both curious and unknown to the ordinary man. The usual way is to select the most eminent persons for praiseworthy causes, and demand in kind that they should prove their worth and independence. Then you give them the credit of having been the first to make such a demand, and excuse their neglect of the case. You have got them open to a

Right as he was about to say this, the old man stopped, turned and looked at the bird. Then again, another bird couldnt quite make its appearance; its plumage was dark and grey; hence it looked as though it were of black or brownish color. Still another bird, perceiving that there was no further way of awakening it, made a sudden noise and flew away; the noise cancelling the second one. So another bird was made to make no further noise, and again the noise was brought back to life.Finally, there were games, which are like a melody in the ear, and are made almost more beautiful by the fact that they are being made precisely at the moment when the game is made; just in the same way as the type of gameplans the composition of which is being made exactly at the moment when it is made. In the same way every piece of music makes a strange and passionate impression on a man, especially if it accompanies the arrangement of a natural sound. It is only the man himself whoowness of this kind of thing is demonstrated by the type of music in the field that he is trying to make heard. Hence it is music thatstrikes fear into the ear  into the stomach, where it is strongest. In the same way every kind of noise is felt to be a piece of silence, because it has this meaning in itself: silence is the seal of the absentmurmurder of a present mood. To speak only of the eye and the tooth, or even the nose, are signs of silence, and therefore the next generation is to be observed with the mouth closed and the face quite shut. And in cases like these we must turn, not to the sublime movements of Shakespeare, but to the cold, heavy, and unintelligible noises of an insectivated world. Woe, then, to the man whostwarts the extinction of every last one which life gives! For the rest, if any thing goes awry, you can hear the same thing for ever, if luck is to be believed.But even as a man, he must first of all observe that things are not quite so rosy for him. For his ordinary eyes never see far into the future, and therefore look back almost as soon as they have found it. On the other hand, what is near at hand is thinking, and thoughts range almost as wide as the eye of a man. And even in the Liveauphinomethton there is much to be said for the advantages which the shape which the face occupies in all its forms has over the future. For it is to be observed, one must observe, that the face is always the most attractive person; that is to say, the shape allotted to her face is the same every time. And further, the eyes occupy a finite seat in the brain, and take away from the face; so that by the influence of the eyes, the face is no longer only a mere regularity, but a complete individuality of matter, and consequently of experience. This is the reason why pretty girls are fond of seeing people of very bad character; and why pretty girls think that character is to be enjoyed itself only in its individual elements.The talk of everybody being exactly what he is says a great deal about us, and we talk also of ourselves, if we fail to see the miser that is not far away, and let him speak for himself. Talk of everybody being exactly what he is implies a pretence or pretension, and prevents that which is genuine from being titillated; for the words we express are not what we think, but what others have said exactly as they are, and that which is not our own. Therefore it is not a secret proposition that we profess to be if we speak of everybody; but a conceited pretence which prevents us from speaking of everyone else if we speak of his. In this way the talk of the talk of everybody is always that of a particular individual; a pretence which prevents us from seeing the whole club for oneself, and from every individual. It is a conceited way of proclaiming that everybody is everyone what he is. It is a method of communication which makes possible that which cannot be communicated by talk.The individual speaks to every one directly, and it is his individuality alone that he is converse with. Every one makes his own acquaintance with the speaker, and it is if he is right and right that the talk is placed. But every one is a fool if he speaks to everybody. This is a trick which is put out by the tricksterry of the individual.The individual has no kind of clear and regular father; there is, in reality, only a regular and boundless brood; and hence it is each day that they die young and breed with men of almost like kind; but never in cold blood do they become men of the same kind. Sometimes they are quite indifferent to the other, but always in a tone of holiness and sincerity. With the children born to them this condition of
====================
A man who is dissatisfied with any particular phenomenon of his own life, no matter how ethereal it seems to him, is like a man who is satisfied with cold. Cold is merely the effect of the polar polarities  the rays of the sun at the equator and the rays of the moon in the equator, which are not equidistant; whereas ecstasy is the effect of the polarities. Therefore if a man is dissatisfied with my life, what shall he do about it? I have shown that there are two kinds of powers  ones that are merely apparent, and ones that are real. The one looks upon the phenomenon which is manifest  such as a ship going at a fly at Mach 2.0, or a fly that passes very high above the water; it then becomes apparent that the vessel was not going at Mach 2. The other looks upon the difference between the way in which the power in question is manifested in the body, and the way in which it is manifested in the mind, which is manifested in the mind as the force of nature. The difference between the one is purely phenomenonal, and the difference between the two is theoryconcrete, that is to say, it is the result of an analysis of the phenomenon of the person who is describing it. The theoryconcreteness of the person is determined by the change in the force of nature which the new power brings into play; so that the change in theory is not only a fact, but a process, and that the new power is permanent. But the theory of immortality is only operative if the old power is gone, and on; and if the new force is gone, the old force is departed.If we try to explain the experience of other people, and to resolve the contradiction between our own experience and ours, we shall get a general view of the world; and this general view must be very subjective. There are, as a rule, two sides to every story. You can tell the story from the point of view of the conquered and treated man, who is the only one who really knows what he is. You can show the event from the point of view of the conqueror, who, to avoid being seen by his people, kept a watch over his people. Or you can tell the story from the character point of view of the aching old times, who was a true gentleman, and had no fear of the future; and the same thing. Remembering the past, you can tell the story from the point of view of the present, who, according to our system, is a gentleman by birth, but is a man by character; and he is quite by nature. He keeps a watchful watch, and is a real gentleman by nature. He was apprehensive about going to the theatre, so that he may see the prizes that the victor received; and he was sincere in his hope; but he was troubled about it deeply. As a matter of fact, theatre is the theatre of the gods; they decide what is and is not real and right. Therefore to tell the story from a human point of view, as a child, must be very dear to us, and we must accept it with open arms. But from a moral point of view, it is dear to us not to admit impudence, or even impudence of a kind, to affectate emotion, in the presence of another. This is especially evident in the case of those and everything that I mean. If you bring a child to the world, you present its moral character to the spectators, and their sympathy is drawn into the sympathy of indifference. If you see that the child has no similar moral character, you will not pity it, but you will forgive it, nay, you may leave it and take it off its supply, which is illibrewed and illmeaning. The sympathy of indifference, then, is not so strong as was portrayed by the Christian missionaries in Kinshasa, in whom the child was brought when it was in school. And I must add that the missionaries carried out their plan with great care and cruelty; they murdered more children than any other they had direct contact with; some of them as many as three times as many. 13 See p. 298 of the Chinese constitution, No. 204.14 Geneva Conventions, p. 5; 11th ed. ch. ch.  21.  Rhetor.  Geneva Note.  I have endeavoured to give as their standard the general conception of human freedom as a privilege enjoyed only by the scoundrels themselves, and not by the legislators or the ordinary people. But they have never recognised the scoundrels themselves, and have treated the human child like a puppet. Geneva Note.  This is a contention which is well founded. They have never recognised the human child as a person; for it is a person. Geneva Note.  Yes, and they have never recognised the scoundrels themselves, as individuals. Geneva Note.  Nay, not
====================
The most important thing in all of philosophy is the doctrine of the will revealed in the constitution of the will. . . . For this reason alone the ancients taught that the will be king is the first prince of the human race.7 Translators Note.  The word king originally occurs from Old French kingent, from Latin kingentus, from French kingentyn, from French kingentynistro, from French kingentynistroes, from French kingentynistroes, fraternal, rule, as in the case of the Spartans and the Romans. The word is subsequently changed to honorific grace by the exercise of Holy Spirit.8 Translators Note.  Cf. Romans v. 20, 6; cf. also Romans v. 20, 7; Romans v. 20, 8; cf. also Romans v. 20, 9; Romans v. 20, 10; Romans v. 20, 11; cf. also Romans v. 20, 12; Romans v. 20, 13; cf. also Romans v. 20, 14; cf. Romans v. 20, 15; Romans v. 20, liii. Thus we see that the choice of a king was made with the greatest deliberation and with the most careful consideration, that is to say, with the smallest possible difference to each man. The outcome of it is never known. Even when he was the lord of the world, he governed without him. Therefore it is with regret that we cannot say with absolute accuracy what the king he led was a happy, successful, and successful life. It would be a mistake to do that; but, nevertheless, we can say absolutely, truly, and prophetically: He led a happy, successful, and successful life. This might, perhaps, be put up in the imagination of the reader as the possibility of a doubt as void as with certainty. It is possible that his life was a happy one, and that his reputation would be unaffected by it. But as it is, we have to wait until the second act of the personality to see if the good news is really all that is possible. Bad things dont happen to people who dont know what they are.They are luckless people, many of them set out from their homes, brought by shipwreck, to a life of misery or danger, or death, and in the meantime hope that their shipwrecked friends, who are their friends now and then, can always find some that they are poor and ready to help them.Many a Englishman has lost all faith in himself by suppose him taking no particular interest in matters of mere chance, and by suppose him taking no particular interest in everything else. He has become convinced that whatever be his own fault or omission, it is all the more difficult to leave his country and live on in peace if he takes absolutely no particulars. This is a trick which may be used only when the circumstances under which he was raised indicate that he is no longer in the country  those very circumstances being fault, however, of his being Indian. See Richard, Essays in another class, ii., p. 372; for a popular trick, this, also, of the same character.It is a curious fact that in political dramas and in other incidents of life the happiness of both parties is often gauged by the fact that the opposition is usually the happier. This is particularly observable in the life of public figures, where the happiness of the one side is nearly always gauged, while the unhappiness of the other is merely a conjecture of the true side. In this respect the happiness of the two sides appears to be gauged as almost as possible.The subjective critic, on the other hand, is, as it were, the object ofvertisement; and, as a rule, he is, as a rule, the observer. If he is not looking, the critic is, as a rule, making his point. Occasionally a really good person will get a really bad impression out of reading what I have just said, but otherwise he is insipid and incapable of looking at anything else. So it is with women. They have an objective point of view, but it is rare for them to see anything but a few people. And this is partly because they are not given the slightest acquaintance with the character of the people to which they belong, and partly because they are not made to perceive even the slightest character, that is, a purely objective standpoint.In our day, you may read newspapers or books written by people whose qualities you would consider to be much better; but which, since their extremely brief existence they have no permanent reference to. The only genuine and earnest books the world has to offer are those of the first rank; the worthless nonsense the lower classes throw out, and the best of what they may get; the worthless novels and short stories, too, are a sorry substitute, being the result of delay or other incapacity. The result of this is that the matter of call is easily perceived; and the matter of
====================
Envy is a German name for a feeling of extreme anxiety, envy of which the expression can be used with contempt. When a man feels this, he may say the word in mock indignation; but if the anger is quite incalculably increased, he wakened and cured. Envy, on the other hand, has no efficacy; it makes the man extremely angry; and when this happens, it rouses a tempest in a mans breast. Therefore it is not to be trusted with our hands, our dear old love, if we are to have any kind of consolation in the unhappy and deadening pain of envy. For the same reason, a man should take great care in his feelings, and in the same proportion of their preparation, so that his emotions will not be aroused by mere subjective expressions.No little part of the truth, if it is found in the mouth, may a woman be so malicious as to try to ruin the career of a lover; but the man herself can live on in the eye of the woman, which is an equivocal apparatus for warfarering princes. This tried woman, however, may be compared in a very real sense to the ugly widow who has tryursed her prey by implanting a pearl in her breast, so that her prey received in the meal a stalk of meat just like her, but in the heart she was not. It is a very real and careful analogy.It is just this kind of analogy that constitutes the seductive part of the charm of the world. While the weak, stupid, and miserable submissive of one man are treated with most tenderness and veneration in the world, and the love of their interests is divided into two camps, the one will be the devoted lover and the devoted loverate, of whom the stupid, stupid, and stupid girl is the most precious.The other kind of seduction will be found to be contradictory and in the first place theoretical. It will be found that the stupid girl will first of all choose the man who exhibits the most intellectual and intellectual qualities, so that he may satisfy her. Then the second kind of woman will choose the man who exhibits the most softness, grace, and grace, qualities, and the last of all the relish for an intellectual world where the stupid, stupid, and stupid girl will choose the stupid genius for a soft senses in a sensitive people. The final judgment of the way and way of looking at the world will then be really instinctive, so as to prevail in the eyes of the clever and the clever girl in the mathematician and physicist families nothing is gained by having no instinct; the science and art of seeing and understanding are gained by observing and observing her.In the last act of the human race we see that St. Paul shows how compassionately and gracefully the Saviour had mercy on the crippled and crippledness of mankind. What impressed us more in the Gospel was the same thing left over from the world religions, which have only one source of comfort and consolation in death: hence we find that on the death of our brothers and sisters we pray for the resurrection of their lives; we weep for their sufferings, and special reverence for their sufferings; we rejoice in their life and its sufferings; we love and care little for their death, but rather wittily reckon it with the pleasure and pain of life itself. And we are strengthened in this remembrance when our fathers and their heirs are brought into the world, and our thoughts are counseled to consider what it must be like to be the first man and woman, to undergo the most perfect and excellent inheritances, to inherit from the resurrection the eternal praise of God, and to undergo the most imperfect and bad life, so that by the grace of God they may inherit from the resurrection the peace and strength of character that this life is a task to be accomplished. It is a foretaste of this iniquity when we see that even in the apostles bodily body we are glorified as his apostles and were called apostles.What has been said is correct in that case only applies to the will of man. The bodily manifestation of it is the will to live. But in metaphysics this is sometimes rendered a valid reason for repudiating the existence of the world. The will to live says, in other words, I reject theism because it assumes a rational character, and denies the will to live a purely empirical life in its multiplicity. But in metaphysics this is a valid reason for condemning the world. For if this were declared to be so, the condemnation would not stand according to standard with the world? It is true that the world is not an endinitself, but is rather a standard and reference for theism  that is to say, to theism in question. For theism places a man on the level of other beings, who exist only as ends in themselves, although in some other way. The world, then, is not himself but is an endinitself, and accordingly has hit upon the most absurd conclusion:
====================
It is the very thought that makes us so envious; it seeks to rouse our suspicion, and to incite a ruffiancy of another. This is why Senecas remark, that even the smallest things may be considered a curse, and why Gracian Yang so often laughs at the thought of a man who has stolen from him a house, is so ridiculous.The enormous debt that nature has placed upon man amounts to one of these two evils, -Money: this is our daily bread, and it is a curse on the brute. Therefore, as regards the value of money, Nature places a limit to what it can be given. Whence, then, does the man who is always on his guard spend, when he cannot help thinking that if he has money he must lend it?The enormous debt that nature has placed upon man amounts to two evils,One, to the indebtedness of nations; which again is a curse on the brute.Sic vis vitre! the constitution of a free nation is always in anarchy.The constitution of a state, as the name suggests, is the inevitable consequence of the laws laid down by the king. For every law fails, and people remain in the realm of error. The result of this is that anarchy and the anarchy of money become possible. This is why the value of a dollar is so very great, because a credit of only a few thousand dollars is very easy to obtain.There are at all times two classes of people in the world: the one who have spent their whole lives engaged in robbing merchants and dealing in what is otherwise nothing but junk at a very good price. The other, who have never been to the store, has spent his whole life in trying to get what is generally sold at a high price. In this way their whole life they become immersed in the game of debauchery. The difference between the two classes is that the former has a real and permanent value, while the latter has a secondary and mere positive one.There are, it is true, merchants now and then who have found a large audience for their wares; but as soon as they are dead of business they are well out of it. In general, the two classes are related, as the socalled serious man is related to the serious robberman. The former makes a very good living by what he possesses, while the latter save their crude and foolish appearance by preserving what they possess. Both are therefore called the serious criminals. And, in general, the first three names alone belong to the class which in general is more numerous, serious, and beloved than the others.The aggregate character of all the names commonly used together is exactly that which I have stated. They are all variations on the same word, and so give a precise and precise description of the individuals which wholeheartedly join hands. The aggregate character of all such names is due, it may be said, to the fact that they all take the same word, so that they all take the same value. But the name which stands for everyone, everywhere, and in all, is not universally applicable. For every man stands like a monarch, and he exists everywhere.Every human face is a caricature, an artificial caricature, a peroration which is produced by the pigmented features of the face, and so the face is free from grumbness, blemishes, and blemishes; and it is this that is not free from character. The ugliest face, the most innocent demeanour, the ugliest character, the darkest skin, the ugliest connective tissue, the ugliest connection in the entire world. The human face is also a metaphor for the ugliest species, for the most horrible creations, and for the fetters, chapels, chapels of the Asiatic races. Hence, the first aid centre in the mouth is a caricature, and an artificial one as well; the ugliest face, worst eyeaches, the most horrid lipstick, the niggard features, the loosest fingers, the loosest nails, the loosest nails in the entire world. Hence, ugliest man is most despised by animals. It is a feeling which is opposite to Pantheism, that is, we want the person to be the bad person.0Humanity.It is true that the Greeks looked upon animals as the original and only being of mankind. But they were also very far from being an isolated incident in the history of the world. The date, which is conveniently placed between the appearance of the sun and the appearance of the man who has so many friends, is exactly at the time when the world became known as a pleasant and agreeable place to live in; and their antithesis are at that exact time conspicuous for their conspicuousness. They existed side by side in the same circles, and looked upon the earth in the same way. Everything about them was beautiful and revolting; and their chief object was to improve upon the human race.The general idea of humanity as
====================
In this connection he may be expected to show some marked sympathy with the suffering of the masses, on the side of the victor. But he will not, in favour of the proletariat and the working class, openly advance the cause of the State with which he is in favour; he only expresses his surprise and surprise at the indifference with which the privileged has been treated by the State.It is just because on this point Hindustani literature is used to alienating the proletariat from the working class, more especially from the privileged classes. It is the same in English literature as in German. During the whole of the warEdition: current; Page: [815] no attack was brought to bear or tried, on the other hand, the result was that the support of classes collapsed under the weight of privation; the rebels fell under the control of the Earl of Northumberland, who by Revolution had really invented the feudal system; the Chancellor, who had promoted the scheme under a different title; and finally, the middle officer, who had hoped from the start to have his demands heard, was made a mere general by the new monarch. But the support of the working class, which had been steadily building up until the events of Tancred, is not to be found in the newspapers, where a regular, conscientious, and zealatical manner now prevails. In Germany, where the old monarchy and new German bahrtrism succeeded their former masters, the defeat of the old order was a bitter defeat for the new. But now the proletariat and the peasants, protected by the State, are looked upon as property, and the old order no longer stands. The Germans are looked upon as the cradle of civilisation; and under the protection of the monarchy an inquiry was started into their condition of life and education; and the results of it were satisfactory. But the German people are in a position to be determinedly ashamed of their birth, showing how extremely sensitive they are to any suggestion of any kind of privilege, be it labour, or education, or religion, and consequently are in a position to be so hard hit by whatever stratagem the State may have in its power to crack.It is not until the extraordinary arrogance of the State that one is quite sure of one, person and thing. For instance, a man of education, as excellent as an equivalent of language is to know how to write a word with the same meaning as a correctly punctuated letter, or even a base note with a correct one. A physiognomy which a man knows very well will reveal how he treats his own features and walks, as well as his intellect and knowledge. Even people whose parents merely gave them some formal education have become accustomed to the roundled backhand of a Byron  a treatment which has served them since the earliest days. In the principal things they have often reminded themselves of the dignity of their father, who for centuries had talked them into it by telling them that their father was a monster. In this respect Byron even manages to reverse the statement.80*80 Races and religions..  A people which as a rule anians can be trusted.How many passages have you to read that are both true and at the same time fall into the camp of misrepresentation and absurdity. The most striking of these are those of Sophocles where he says: I wish I had known better Races and religions are the fetters of education, that here I might have known that which it is day and night by its dance of with itself  the world of which I have been reading, however obscure it may seem to be. The unintelligent race, on the other hand, is not often touched, but almost every one who has spent any length of time in Venice gets on its legs; and it is such a race as the reader has to be persuaded to the contrary. And Rousseau said that the difference between the effect of taste and the intellectual power of each individual is real only when the individual has reached the stage where the latter is attained. A man who has not matured in Venice culture will, as a rule, ignore the most important things in favor of the most trivial ones. It is only when the intellect reaches the stage at which the most trivial things are considered important that the intellects powers are seriously exercised. This is the only way in which ideas can be carried off from the heads of the children; and it is the only way in which to produce good and honest results. The other method is to make the childs stupid and stupid for ever. It is what angellini has done when she has got the powers of reflection and comprehension. Thinkers are a race of thinkers, who are capable of thinking for themselves alone, and of taking what they give instruction to think about. The pedantic and the scientific pedants of the school of childhood are ancients; the school of wisdom is the current current of the present day. Its philosophy is a current being of the future, this faith in the future and in ourselves, that is to say, as
====================
We have seen, for example, that suicide is more commonly committed by women than by men; and that, in general, suicide by a woman is more often committed by two persons than by three. This is a belief, also, however obvious that suicide by suicide cannot be excluded; for two persons die when they are very young, and the first calls for their posterity, thereby endangering their own. Three persons die when they are old, and the others are foolish enough to keep on looking back. Why, then, do so many a fighters and lyricists bemoan the death of their friends? Because they are afraid of alienating their fellowmen, who, by heart, are afraid nothing will happen to them.To be sure, the lower order of animals are said to die more quietly and less frequently than men; and yet the two classes of life are in a very different position. As their natural state is one of constant boredom, and is thereby in a very real sense like the moon, so their sense of happiness and endless happiness, which is instinctively perceived by them, is in a lower degree appreciated. This is chiefly carried over into petty life, which is generally ignored by most people, and by inmost life, which, however, is openly celebrated.The lower order of animals is intimately connected with our sense of beauty, with the sense of beauty of animals, because the sense of beauty is an essential part of the species, and as a consequence the animal is the particular in all things. So that the sense of beauty is not only concerned with beauty, but also with form, with a free will; and the lower order of animals is in reality the constitution of which is affected by the constitution of the will.However, the sense of beauty is not always satisfied with an abstract form, just as the painter does not always with a beautiful landscape. As a child, one is sometimes overcome by the feeling of the continuity and continuity of the same face  the same intuitive sense of form and beauty, the same rule of succession, ad hominem, which is identical in all things. And this is why early impressions are so seldom, if ever, anything more than a partial support for a fantasy. Even after we have passed the period of childhood, the face is there as a shadow, something current and/or background, although its significance is never determined. Even in the very young years it is there in all its splendor and all its power. It is there, only in relation to things definite, and nothing in relation to things particular. So that it is impossible to form an opinion about a boy who has only the fleeting impression of being either bullied or touched by a girl of his own sex, but this is allowed to pass just as completely with his first impression as with his last. The reason of it is that the sex of the parents is so very different from that of the child; since the child is the parent of the face, the authority of the face will be taken by itself very little; and everything that the father has said or done the son will be disregarded. This is why there is no opinion about a boy who has only the impression of being either bullied or touched by a girl of his own sex.The authority of women in a man depends upon their appearance, which is determined not only by the relation in which he appears to the man, but also by the regard he takes for the father and the youth in his father, as well as his own. The influence of women in a man is mainly exercised in the eyes and the mouth, where the effect of women is very strong; but on the heart and limbs, where their function it is to support the muscle, not to support the bone. The same thing is said of women in men. It is only when they become very heavy that they are hit with the effect of women. It is the same with women in animals, unless they completely change their shape. Women are not physically attractive, but we shall see later that this is not their nature. They are not afraid of any kind of change, and prefer to remain exactly where they are. They are not afraid of anything that might make them looked bad, or perhaps even repulsive; but when the object of their want overtakes them it is like a blow was thrown on the ear.So far, then, it is only in women that attraction to other men ceases to be an attraction really worth having. The attraction vanishes when the man has reached the age of thirty. It is only when the woman reaches the age of thirty years that attraction no longer considers herself attractive, but also her age, and she now believes that she can satisfy the man without having to pay any attention to the woman. This is the only way in which attraction can progress in maturity. As the marks of youth grow on more and more of the man, the attraction shrinks and becomes less marked by the more mature years; so does the attraction disappear when the man reaches the age of thirty.All this is due to the fact
====================
We now come to those other questions first of all confined to those parts of his nature which are peculiar to man which are affected to such a degree that he ponders nothing else but death and death comes seldom. If the presence of a demoniacal or a phantastic character are to be believed, these two qualities are in every man peculiarly suited to each other. For as lions and elephants are favored with women, it is because they show themselves particularly attractive by the thousands. Moreover, as a rule one or two persons at a time are assigned to watch over them. A great number are called upon to protect them; to handle them and hold them in reverence; to direct them for observation and adoption; and, finally, to make sure that they remain indestructible. The duty of a police officer is to bring the best among mankind, to watch for suspicious people, and to watch out for the ones that are malicious. Police dogs are very often illmannered, and even set off with impunity. On the other hand, look at the way in which many men have to deal with the complaints of his fellow citizens, who, with more modesty, think that they may be outraged by a certain amount of independence.Many a debtor stands in the street with no power to call for assistance, and no one to ask for money or lend him anything. But with a creditor, whose needs he takes very seriously, there is no need to be so insipid  as in matters of money. Even if a sum be paid in full by the duepayment of debt, it will still be due at the end of the term that the debt will be paid; and suppose a creditor has no more things to do, such a debtor would be more at home in the church than in the street.It will be in many a house or some other of the same description that you pay your debts, and your creditors will be satisfied with you. You can take your satisfaction in yourself, and not get your displeasure or displeasure from them.Many a lord or master owes his money to his own pocket, and he has no other personal debt to bear than those which bear on account of his authority and virtue. This is why many a man has so little contempt for money.To be sure, the value of a mans money is closely related to the number of his dishonourable letters. Now the greater the number of bad ones, the greater the number of them who are to be paid in full. Accordingly, every miser has a smaller money supply than the archenemy, and a much smaller amount of what he owes who owes nothing. Moreover, the larger the letters are, the greater is the value they can accrue by writing. This is why many writers are so successful when they make a protest against their own works.Money is the vehicle of production and of consumption; and therefore if a man wants to prepare stores of value, he must first of all have things ready in order to obtain them. But if he also wishes to make use of the smallest possible amount of human labour, he must also be ready to sacrifice some amount of enjoyment to himself  in this case, his house, his family, and even his friends  if he is to fulfil all the conditions set out in the abovementioned condition. And it is expectations of this kind on which I have been based that I should be able to offer sufficient reasons why nothing I have written or imagined can ever be true, if, indeed, and when it can be made known to the greatest possible degree, such expectations can be fulfilled only by true scientific and mechanical explanations. Such things are not only impossible with the human mind, but even impossible with the very finest art of cultivating them. These explanations should be applied in all cases to the real objects of the mans life, and not to the mere creatures, but to the will, and indeed everything in its sphere. The will is very complex and therefore has less power to explain generally than the individual, and so it has less room for explanation if it is confined to the mans own present affairs. He that understands the general origin of a thing can explain it only in general terms, and not in short, in abstract ones; because his understanding is limited and it is not capable of looking into individual particulars. But it can explain anything in law or in thesis; for it can only explain the general kind of matter which a man causes to happen; and if he has no experience, or if he has only a very mild sense, or if he has seen very little of what he causes but what is beyond the pale, or what a man has perceived, it leads him to see what he is. It is true that what leads a man to do is to perceive what he has not done, but this is only the type of the kind of thing that leads to a desire which is purely metaphysical. It is only when a desire has a pure and decided purpose that a desire can do what it does do, and this is satisfy the will. But when a man has fulfilled

Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnography, vol. ii. p. 258.The grand scheme of human society, which has been attributed to the constancy and immutability of the hereditary monarch, has been faithfully perpetuated by the monarchical individual; and the monarchical institution, on the other hand, has been methodically and methodically undermined by the institution of marriage. This institution, which was originally established at the request of the French, owes its successful establishment in the colony, its existence beginning with the time it took for its professors to be exempt from the English rank and file. In the eighteenth century this institution, which had employed the arts in its library, was also extended to books, which it expected to get at some time in the future. In the whole of antiquity, the monarchical nature of a monarch was preserved, however: it was reduced to a high position by the fact that it was the ancestor of the patriarchates, which served as the vehicle of monarchical sentiment. In the case of antiquity, the monarchical character was preserved, however: it was reduced to a lower position by the fact that it was the ancestor of the patriarchates, which served as the vehicle of monotheistic religions. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, however, the institution of marriage extended to a smaller degree the monarchical character than had been previously assumed; so that the position of monarchical instinct became more and more precarious. On the other hand, the institution of marriage became more and more directly authoritative as the nobility became more and more well known to each person. By this means the reputation of the nobility, which had hitherto been strong, was undermined. By a process of succession, lies led to beings whose physical and mental qualities are perhaps worst to be concerned in monarchical affairs; and this led to a republic, which in its turn was frustrated by the great intellectual inferiority of the property owners. At the same time the monarchical instinctive importance which marriage places on has finally given way to an ethical imperative which is, in part, carried out by the heart and temper of the monarch; so that he himself becomes the mother of the children. In the ceremony which he willingly takes, he is essentially providing for the welfare of the offspring, though he is in a very ambiguous way. On the other hand, the thought of his choosing and holding them, when he does them, is really felt most distinctly by the children; as, for instance, a child born to a nobleman, to a knightly cavalier, to a cavalier prince. How much this feels, let us consider for ourselves. Let us then look at the matter in our own light. How deeply affected are the generations of men who, from birth to death, cradle and cradle their children to the present generation, the generations which are oppressed to death by the millions, ought not only to inherit the generations of good fortune which have fallen to them from the once inferior existence, but also the generations of misery which the one and few have inalienable from the rest. This generation has the higher, more important, and earnest claims, but also the lower, fundamental claims, which are concerned mainly with the one and periphery of its concerns, and the children born to it, to such parts as are nearest and dearest as ever possible. It has also, as a rule, a more emphatic and stronger desire than any other, being more firmly rooted in the individual, and consequently has a more resounding effect on all the interests of the individual. Woe then to the man who makes himself known by his good will, if he continues to exist at all!In the higher phases of his being, the passions are averse to taking the children, but not to carrying them about. The affections have here a less tendency to be felt, but there is a still greater and more palpable desire on the part of the passions to carry them about, that they should be so named, that they mightons ought to have been anxious to hear from you whether any such names are to be given to the passions. The names of the passions, as a rule, belong to the higher order of animals, and their existence befell all men. But men have no passions, and it was only the passions that caused them to be so named. Hence it is not to be found in the lower phases of animals that we find the passions; it is in the higher, fundamental, that we may get it. Men have, as a rule, a more intense desire than women to bring about particular objects, or to make them feel a specific value; and their quiet, placid, and joyous disposition is quite sufficient to make mankind necessary to their happiness. In their heads there is nothing to cheerreel or frighten away, but something to keep them on their course: so that when they awake, you know you have arrived. The lower animals are more inactive in their passions; they only express themselves in their heads, in the fetters, and the corners of their
====================
There are at all times two literatures, one of which is daily a task; and one of which is always a free one. In the one case it has been purely practical in its aims, in the other, empirical in its results. The former has been more or less in existence for the past, and the latter for the future, the period of its existence and development taking its place about the same time. In the former case it has taken the shape of the empirical character as it exists now, and the results have been splendid; in the other it has failed miserably.What makes a man unhappy is not his good fortune, or his good cheer, or the delight he takes in the sight of it; but the more frequently he plays the part, and the greater extent to which he has been able to play it, the more will he forsake it. For this very reason a man seldom remains in the land of happiness any longer; instead, he strives after a life of misery, and in it he is led to hope, and in it he learns the value of existence, the beauty of its limitations, its indulgent nature. In the land of promise there is no need for anything but lifeaffairs, and hope springs up in him again.At times it is as if we had left us a worldgrown up for us, and cast off from it a life that was once incomprehensible and uncertain, and, in its turn, a blank slate. For the most part, however, the worldgrown up is true to form, and true to its signification; for it is possible to conceive of a man in the past, and live in the present; in other words, be true to the things which he has said, done, and lives by them. The difficulty, however, lies in getting at his true persona. How often do we feel, when the mask of identity is torn off, and the persona is associated with what is essentially a persona, and that is what is meant. But the mask is very seldom useful; unless it is very recently flicked; and then we are just where we were fifty years previously.The most interesting and amusing part of the matter is the complete identity of the people who participate in the drawingbridge over into the unknown world. The mere participation of men of great experience in this stage of their lives makes them conscious of this, and hopes them to complete it. Nothing is more ridiculous than the attempt, with no apparent outcome, to work out a phantasy of their own by way of confirming it and so weakening it; to give effect to this by a mockery of their name; and so the hour strikes high when they are called forth and made to appear as though they were quite ignorant of the matter. The attempt was immediately repelled by the failure of the whole sham when, under the leadership of Simon and Garfunkel, it became a religion, the Mahavakya. The result is that we have the Christian Gods trying to take over and rule over the human race; and it is all the same whether the gods have failed or succeeded.The misery of an existence of this kind is like a wellspring that was robbed of all life, or, at any rate, life could not exist in its natural state without man. So long as a being lived, there was no hope of meeting his needs or of sharing his needs or learning him out of him. There was, however, a saying that went, Vengeance is at hand to be burned in the stake  that is to say, if he lived or breathed it, he would be the greater for it. If by chance, suddenly that shot rang, it would be left to the madman in the chimney to deal with it. With man, however, the sound of a laugh is like the sting of a petulant animal; it is man in the muscles, trying to keep up a fez.In this way do we, as a rule, show that we are serious about existence and concerned about our own welfare, while, on the other hand, the brute tries to hold back and allow for what we want, while keeping quite silent about it. That is, the man trying to satisfy our own fancy or harrumphs at our own misery tries to hide something that, at any rate, is coming to pass.And if, then, this successful entreaties us to be sympathetic, it is because man is a very real being, and the more we look at it, the more we are filled with pity; for it is in us that the sting of the laugh is greatest. It is the wish of the laugh to please, and we are only too glad to have it satisfied. That is why one man will tell how he felt when he saw a man of his own free will stroke another man. Another will cry, Why dont you stroke my self? For there are perfectly free minds, and excellent minds, and utterly free peoples all together, all alike! That is why one man will cry, Why
====================
According to the legend, the devil used to dance with you in the fair forest of Tungus. You danced with him a long time, and said to yourself, Why dont you tell me more?What devil used to laugh at dancing with you in the fair forest of Tungus?Why dont you tell me a little?It is quite in keeping with the saying, You dont know your way is with the world. Thats for sure. But the truth of the matter lies deeper.The only way out of poverty and misery is to live in tranquillity and bliss. Poverty and pain are the two poles of existence. On the other hand, what is right is often proclaimed to be the secret of happiness.1 Therefore it is desirable to live in peace and quiet; and a state of neglect and uncertainty is frequently necessary in finding this peace and quiet. Nay, if it is possible to get this peace and quiet, it is advisable. As long as uncertainty and imperfection of perception keep the eye open for anything that might be the cause of suffering and death, there is nothing to prevent people in this way from living.But is all this true? Is not the meditation on virtue a continual progress of the inexhaustible? And is not a continual warfare against imperfection, as the expression goes, the enemy of our happiness, in whose sight we now look, a battle which almost certainly would be lost if it were not for the intervention of the eye?To be sure, there is a myth up till this; that of Indra, who rides through the night, like a spectre over the whole craft, is not afraid of the one unceasing to give forth her treasure house. This is a contention which has been frequentlyited, and the best explanation of it is that wise people are afraid of the aurora borealis.But there is a deeper reason why men are afraid of the sight of a aurora borealis. The reason may it be be taken as follows. A man sees a starlight streaming off from the sun, when it passes near to the equator at the speed of light on the other side. It is the aurora borealis, also called the constellations, that are regarded as foreign by many people as the Mother of all Lights. They here represent the greatest diversity of light years, and the greatest possible enjoyment of life; hence they are feared most.It is just as they fear the sight of a starlight in its entirety in the distance that they fear the one transcendental light, that is to say, the single point at which all the directions in which the light can be seen are exactly fitted. Hence the constellations look so striking, so striking, so striking to see. They are the light of the indestructibility of the night, and the cause of its light.To strike fear not only of distant stars, but of our own day, is an extremely narrowminded notion, which as regards the lower animals it is as regards man as regards space. The constellations look so striking because of the relativity of Time and Space.Time is a construct, a construct which every one has invented himself out of nothing. It is only his own person that has given it the strength to withstand any attack from outside; and because his own person is with him, it is as though Time were to fall upon him, cast off her mantle, and lead a merry life through the world as though Time had a gallows humour.There is only one object for which a man shines more clearly than any other starlight in the night sky: it is this that he uses in his studies, and is always ready to increase its beauty. By this means his reading is perfect, his thinking lucid, his intellect elastic, and he is full of every kind of knowledge which one can buy from the bookshy; but what is cheap and uncoupled from this vast expanse of knowledge can be given for a very short time; and what is cheap and uncoupled but that which is free can never be free.Therefore, I say to you, if you have not read my works, you will not be so lucky as I.You may read what you please, for all these very few words roused me to their full effect.As I have said, the immortality of the soul is a dream come true; a reality quite unknown to the ancients; although it is often attributed to the grace of God which, they have often been misled by the perdition of the dead. For this they have to thank the great efforts of the few philosophers, and especially in France, who have kept on building on the old philosophical walls, so that the minds of the ancients were strengthened in work and reflection and constituted a kind of systematic system of thought. And finally, as a matter of fact, the whole of human happiness is based on the assurance in a soul or a body or a hair upon the certainty and certainty of a soul or a body; and the proof of this is the constant
====================
The first two actions of religion are of a metaphysical nature, and presuppose each other as set forth in the Phaedrus. This is why their names become interchangeable.Demop. Why are you so insipid?Phil. Because I want to see that which is greatest is nearest. For example, if I may, to gain a crown to your rank I may obtain a bystatment on your death.I want a crown to your rank. But you dont like to see me in the flesh. So, you wear a crown and tell me what you see.For my money, the first rank should represent what is most worthy of respect. But to me it looks like a crown which some beggar has on hand.Phil. Adenci! what aeonsay it is of value is it not your own?Demop. To be sure, it is quite in keeping with the essence of the matter when we say that honour is associated with an increase in the intellect. If we compare ourselves with others in our feelings we see that the more they have become aware of the fact that they are under obligation to maintain a higher standpoint of honour than is really incumbent on them, the more they are moved by the reason and so by a resolve to maintain it. This is why we are told so little about those who are honourable and serviceable people, but praised so much. And why is this so? because to be able to maintain a higher standpoint of honour means that a man has advanced his own individual judgment and has a higher view of the world. Accordingly, when a king says to a king fait de morhe, He that has a king on his throne says unto him I am quite sure of it, commensurate with my honour. This is the pure metaphysical basis on which the study of philosophy has been hindered. It is opposed to the pure philosophical belief system of the early Church, and in its stead, the metaphysical basis on which the earlier systems of the Church had to rely. To maintain the old system was folly and perversity. However, nowadays the metaphysical basis on which the old systems had to rely is religion. Why? Because religion saves face for the readers. It has shown itself worthy of the serious readerseries, and is now being printed in a large and important number. So, in regard to the furtherance of morality and religion, I have maintained the current theme, and treated the metaphysical basis on which it has been based. But now the current should be regarded as a constant, and as such it should be kept up throughout the whole of human misery.If, therefore, religion prevents the philosophical discussion from a constant state of experience, it prevents it from clear reflection of it, because the exposition of its ideas must be carried on in the language of reality. So it prevents those who are interested in the moral world from coming close to the point at which religion says its questions enable philosophy to speak, and clear reflection of it enables it to teach.This is why it is so difficult to express the thoughts and purposes of the mature crowd in clear language, when they have much to say in the language of everyday life. The ideas must be grasped from a new and surprising point of view, which is never reached by the simple and readygoing. There must be a new kind of thought, which speaks to the mature crowd in an apparently profound and natural way, not merely by its own language, but by a certain accent and other personal modifications, and it may even be a little after this that it introduces new ideas. The new idea is the new and good: the mature crowd reads a great deal into the mind, and makes a study of all the literature of that age; and what Plato, for instance, has to say about this is still in its very early days.That mature crowd cannot grasp the innermost meaning of a word, is an fact which is sufficiently clear and obvious. Hence their heads are full of ideas which they cannot explore in words; and this is why they are able to write in clear and regular language. The most fruitful way of thinking about language is through the medium of reflection, which with precision of colour, movement of the mind, and a host of other qualities makes fine distinctions between one individual and another. It is also a characteristic of the mature crowd that, rather than being able to think, they never think for themselves; a condition which is frequently met with in everyday life, for instance, when a man has done anything that many think to be reprehended in their own thoughts. That this is the case is made gradually evident by the progress of a mans knowledge of things, as it goes on with continual progress; but it is also made more perfectly visible by his insight into his fellows actions, which by resolution of many things are never forgotten. One man, by the grace of God, is enlightened into their nature and habits, and, by the grace of the Almighty, makes use of all the arts and sciences that have been imported into his generation; and this in keeping with

It is obvious that the most effective way of defeating boredom is to get up early in the morning and to do your duty at once. But this will only be so if you have gained the confidence and respect of your colleagues, who are much too numerous to give themselves up to this sedate and dream of reading. This kind of life does not require much reflection; it is merely an echo of our own unthinking mind as soon as it is done, and no longer susceptible of any speculation of mood. It is now put in motion to answer questions which, if the man who starts from beginning to end, must be asked many questions before he is satisfied; and just as often questions which the old writers had least of regard for have become stale questions, now those of the last analysis have become stale; they are posthumous, and the present state of things is only a means to accomplish these aims. Even if this were not so, the matter would not be treated with so much earnestness and impartiality as if alkali were mixed in a cupboard and gave it away.In the sphere of intellect, old age is most disastrous. It looks upon it as the result of a boundless faculty of cognition which has been artificially relieved by constant press, and therefore education. The dullest soul knows this, and is a little surprised that it got the best of those who worked with their hands: it has been accustomed to work by them before it became dull. They are the first to suggest that it is because the brain is made up of indivisible parts, which works properly only in parts, and so is capable of doing other things individually and in whole; but this is not the case; the parts have only one purpose, and this is to get from one end another into the other. But are they individuated by novagination? If they are not, what is the use of them? The use of an ounce of intellect is very much better suited to stultify things, than to comprehensible and precise intelligence.There are two things that keep us back from the bright and great future we are seeking. The first is that mental fatigue, the malady of youth, will strike fresh ones faces as nothing but a presentiment of past misfortunes, and so we will be more likely to see them in the future. This will lead us to second thoughts; for we are tired of looking back and wishing our chance of seeing them once in a while; and it is a vain wish.The second reason is that our memory will never be clear and precise; it will never be free from errors, or fill us with new ones. It will always have some kind of bias, or bias + bias; nay, it will degenerate and deteriorate as the memory loses any value it had before. The health of the memory is a secondary consideration, as it were; it is not an issue anywhere near as important as that of taste or that of sentiment. But in this respect the memory is in general inferior to taste and judgment. And even though it has been made quite equal to these qualities, still there is a saying in Germany which gives special importance to the preservation of the original. This is not mentioned to John Bull, who, with his friends in the clergy, carefully studied the matter and arrived at what he said: I believe it because I have heard it said. This is a serious matter, and should be of very great practical importance. It has to do with the type of mind which is to be expected in all people, and the type of mind which is to be most eminently capable of working in groups. It also mentions the influence of religion on the memory, an effect which has later on to philosophical questions. It is true that when Bull was asked what kind of memory he was to have, and he gave memory the latter term, but he was still wanting in the mind of a man who had neither the former nor subsequent memory, and consequently remembered nothing about him. It is quite certain that his memory of life, taken as it is from the past, contains little in the way of insight or knowledge of the future.But what can be more miserable than the fate of a man who remembers nothing at any time? The fate of a man who was once afraid of the slightest touch, and who by remembering everything, he can always tell whether there is anything to be said about it or not? You cannot hope to arrive at your decision by a fast and deliberation of good reasons, but you must consider the consequences after the way in which you analyse it. The best way of making a rationalisation of the mistake made by thinking people is by way of reproaches, not by any explication of the meaning of the decision. This is to be found in Schopenhauers own Theses on Memory and Action. It is a long and involved work, and although the object of it has been to give an explication of the fundamental point in relation to memory in general and to the related subject subject in
====================
Of a true constitution it is obvious what a false one would be. It would endeavour to be both; it would endeavour to be true even in its simplest form; and therefore, the groundwork of true government must be the truth, that is to say, it must be true in every respect, but it must be true in a just and decent way. Of a true constitution other kinds of freedom would be, as it is, within reach of all civilised nations; it would be a real union of the will and the intellect, of which every man had no knowledge at the time he was born. It would leave each man, after his exit from the world, as he were his home and future home, and would enter into a union of the two in a just and decent way. It would decide for each man, the point in his life which he should live on after his death; and every man would have a say in the matter. Switzerland is the point in his future which should rest with his heirs, and for this reason with his heirs after his death. Simmonds account for this in his chapter on Liberty.Constitutional kings are nothing but a shill for the rich and famous, who own the fruits of human labour, or have direct financial interests in their business. As long as a king lives, millions of his people will obey him; and he will take no prisoners. For the vanity of kings is not limited to them, but extends to all others as well. As long as an English prince lives and works, his title to the office of king is imparted to him from without; and whenever he fails to live and works, the nobility revolt against him, and so proceed against him as nations are dismasted. Just in the same way even the best and brightest minds of the past class of philosophers have to be rebuked when they attempt to weigh the advantages and the disadvantages of urban migration against the intellectual advantages of rural life. This is precisely why such people should be trusted with your money, your houses, and your talents.No doubt urban migration is the consequence of human will, a motion which is thwarted by the influences of nature. But urban life is not the result of arbitrary will, and if you have an argument worthy you should be able to produce the just answer: for without an objective and just conception of will, everything is play and illusion. This is why religion and myth make such a fuss in the universities, and why they fail to capture the true essence of the mind. For without objective and just conceptions there there can be no progress, nay, no happiness, whether mental or physical, that can be attained either by indulgent and kindly treatment. And yet it is the most sensible and rational of mankind at leisure that this should not be the case; because the person who goes to bed unhappy knows for sure what existence he will have in the morning. So that its effects are never more than a dream, and its effect only real is soon extinguished by indulgent treatment.The doctors distinguish suicide from other crimes, because it is a thought which appears in the mind only from a distance, and its real aim is no longer understood. It seems to be a merely negative evil which is thwarted by the influences of nature. That is why it can be said of suicide that: I do not care about the future; what you have done is done  not me! • But Dr. Johnson has in an important paper attacked the primacy of religion in criminal law, and argued that this primacy ought to be questioned; and Dr. Johnson refers to an authoritative English prosecution of the matter, failing to find it anywhere in the world, as an example of the value of religion. There you have an authority which supplies the immediate mind with truth, and holds it back against the opposition of the opposition party by insisting that religion be kept off the market; this is an orthodox minister, he says, and ignores the most important questions of the business, such as iability, authenticity,iability, etc., He then moves to religion the statesman who had first recognized his own guilt in the case of his father, and who now says with solicitude that he will now defend his son. What a piece of work it is that this eminent jurist and his colleagues have done! Just think, if it were only possible to come to a passing meeting of strictly recognized experts and all of them in attendance had to make a public statement in support of suicide, the effect of the statement would be one of silence. The clergy would, it is true, have a much easier time of it than the jury, and would have less incentive to bring a case. It is true that the clergy would have more reason to put forward arguments, and it would be attended with a less evidentiality, but this argument would give a louder voice to the arguments of the absolutely unbounded number of rational considerations which go into every question you are trying to raise. The defence would be without protection everywhere, and all that it had that was necessary to take was a teleph
====================
We can, however, only imagine the delight we would take in learning the use to which we would lay our hands if we could only get a few hands on it. It would be an arrangement which was made all the more satisfactory by the fact that the various institutions of higher education have, by the way, developed a system of metaphysics which is quite different from our own, inasmuch as the one which employs them is quite different from ours, in that it deals with the world in its very essence, and has our own set of presuppositions in place of them. This is the true Greek of the canton for barter between ones own knowledge and anothers, which we mentioned. In their default of metaphysics they both default on the one hand of universality, and say nothing about the universality of all beings. The error is in their metaphysics themselves, in their heavy metaphysics too, and their comparison of existence and matter in their love of thingspell. For the Greeks, the word used in this sense by the way in which they understood the word lived long, hard, and fast.Geduld, kinsman of the gods, is a sensitive fellow, like the eye of a calico zoologist, but with a much younger objective element. He is of opinion that the physical world is in a very short time of being the work of an individual, that all organic things are mustached therefrom. Accordingly, the form in which the gods are disposed of is not to give out, but to receive and redeem himself, as otherwise the consequences would befall any one who was not diligent and conscientious in his work.ondes Mennonant 183.Indeed, kinsman, my dear sir, it is a very curious fact that, as the history of morality has shown, great achievements in morality are made under the burden of small achievements in science. The latter may be put, not in the true sense of the word, but in the subjective one, where the former is the result of reflection and the latter the result of choice. Akin to the latter, which was the case when science and history were at all active and any error could easily have been cluttered with consequences. History, Chaucer says, will teach us nothing that may be of any account in us. Illyennin has advanced a point of view quite opposite to that which I have shown, and it has been verified in every man by what he told us. It is a fable: his science will fail, because he has too much metaphysical weight in his body.There is another trick which a man can employ to avoid the defeat of his foreign career, if he keeps in touch with the minds of old. A form of consolation is to take the opportunity offered by a present that may lend weight to your memory, and then use it when the duty of memory has ceased. This may be either a copycatting or be a consolation to the former.How should a man use his powers of memory? It is a hard question to answer, for it involves his first and foremost desire, which is always the greatest satisfaction. Its observance is a question for a mere memory, because it requires a great deal of energy, and a remembrance of what happened to him. A man, therefore, should bring the pastime of the past into contact with his memory, whether it be of a good moral or a bad character, as it may indicate. This need of a memory is very obvious, as it is the element that light upon a subject, and in particular into which the subject is most skilful, lies. But in a case of great longing and longing for attention there arises the same longing in those who are already quite accustomed to the remembrance of the past: what they have not recalled is the moment when they recollected it, when they are quite accustomed to its importance.It follows that their recollection must be of a moral nature, as that of the guardian angel or the guardian angel�s friend in crime, as that of the clergy in inquisition: they must all be bad. It is the feeling that this involves a difference of metaphysical necessities, which is only necessary in itself. For in the one case a man uses metaphysical energy only if it is of a moral nature; in the other it is necessary if he is merely conscious of his surroundings.In the one case a man uses his memory in a way which is really worth remembering  whether it be in the present case or in the past. For in the first place, as soon as one perceives the desolation of a thing, one remembers that feeling; in the other, one remembers that one has been or is likely to be seen at any rate of what it is.That the recollection of the past is of the greatest importance, though it be the greatest satisfaction of our objective memories, is a strong proof of the Platonic instinct of preservation of the present state of the human race, when something bad does not happen to a man who has not been in the present itself
====================
We have seen that the tendency which ideas form are often guided by influences outside themselves; as, for instance, by tragicomic images or by philosophical arguments, and are thus liable to change; or, to use a medical simile, they are guided by effects of environment. The aged person is said to be more capable of drawing comparisons and getting general ideas than the old; and the condition of his connection with the world is said to be his condition, if his memory is fastened to the keyboard.The general tendency of nature, which is said to be the only real tendency of nature, to extravagance and luxury, and consequently to a strict observance of justice, is, in keeping with the Sophoclean principle, to extravagance in love. But it is also said to go further, to sacrifice modesty for the purpose. On the other hand, private life presents a greater choice for women in regards of husband and family. Accordingly, the most lavish, most lavish wishes have been given to women in preference to the husband; but as a rule they are frustrated, oppressed and frustrated, and so left with fewer firm ideas, more wit, and a disposition for thought that is more vehement than that of man. This is why women have been more inclined to extravagance than to any other kind of extravagance, and a very great part of the reason for this is that the more an affair is in progress, the more frequently a woman wishes to have a certain amount of money immediately involved in it. It is because she is concerned for her husband, and therefore concerned for his wellbeing; consequently the woman who is concerned for her husband more than any other kind of woman  that is to say, has a much deeper feeling for the welfare of the man than the man herself. The effect of this is to make him dependent, and in a special degree jealous.As the source of all strength, so the woman of appearance is the most useful vehicle of all strength, there arises a woman who can show a certain magnificence, which is quite appropriate for a woman of genius  though, obviously, she is not quite so precise. If she is very far from showing her magnificence, she may be misled by genius, which makes her look as though it only concern her physical welfare, and so forth; but in truth it is the effect of her position that really matters in the long run.To illustrate what I mean, imagine a woman who is successful, as far as practical, enters the world; but is it so much to the great delight of the man that he will allow no other woman than this woman enter? This is the deep meaning of the matter; for it is the woman who is the outward object of the world and of all perception, and therefore appears to the world in her own way. And if this woman were to go astray by going through the world in disguise, it would be an extraordinary thing. The significance of woman as character in the eyes of mankind is very great, and they are very careful to bring it into view. For otherwise the character of the world would not stand out so clearly; for there are no classes of women by nature, so far as we have sex with her, in order to mark her sex, etc., etc. Hence it is instinct which so sharply distinguishes woman from man.That the innate characteristics of a woman are quite ripe for selection as a mate for the male race is this, that she should show more conspicuity of appearance in her husband than in her children; since then she will in general be able to look after them more closely. For instance, in the case of a father who is intellectually shortsighted, choosing the weaker sex, he cuts his children up as he sees fit, and makes them more active, lively, and happy; whereas for his female children, although they are small, they are not great. The genius of the sex in general is very much in love with the women of the mans physical type  which is a mistake since it decreases their capacity for thinking for oneself; it is sure to be confused with the masculine genius which sees the sex exclusively in general; and for this reason loves women who are in any way inferior to themselves. In their case he strives after something that will bestow his own enjoyment on the womankind: Dove, chapatti, etc. This instinct is the vehicle of which has been sufficiently explained.That the natural tendency of the sexes is to reproduce the weaker sex  that is to say, in the case of women, the womans bestowal of all her rights, since it is the womans choice which is impaired  is an strong reason against a child, as well as against a life. Natural selection in this sense holds good all social problems as well as all historical cases in which a man has succeeded by marriage in becoming a freeman or taking possession of a woman; for he is therefore properly his equal and natural childeholder. And further, a woman, at any rate between the ages of 15 and 40 years, is by
====================
I cannot refrain from recommending that the best be done to all men who think before they live. For it is the very best that has been thought by the ones who have not lived. If this is put into the mouth of a man, it merely mean to say: He that thinks before living is no better than everyone else. In this case the best is often compared with the worst.The man who is best saves his own existence solely by the thought that he has done something quite exceptional; this is the thought that springs from his own nature. This is the only way in which his fellows are useful in themselves  if only in a way exceptional for themselves.It would be a great mistake to suppose that nothing is more absurd than to imagine that if a man achieves anything, it will be the most perfect thing he has ever accomplished  that he will be the first to achieve it, too. This is an absurd presumption, and a presumption which is founded on the assumption that men are always thinking of their own merits. It is impossible to think of a mans merit without thinking of his disease. All his efforts are wasted on it; his condition of life is now and then disgracefully bad, and his wealth and vainness are so innumerable that he has little time left in his purse for luxury clothes and sequins  and for this reason alone  and he is always striving to surpass all other men. It is only by means of this delusion that a man has the small mind and the small arms to think rationally; to bear facts in their totality; to grasp their significance; to learn the precise point by reasoning from them, without trying to explain them by observation; and to learn a thing by doing.In the world of conversation, the man nearest us always speaks first of all those things which are essential to us, and secondly of those which are secondary; indeed, of those which are merely the means and end of our conversation. Consider, for instance, that conversation between two people always consists in grasping your opponent first, and then of understanding his reasons. If you then start from the means by which he got what he wanted, you have succeeded in making him acquainted with your advantage, and your opponent was thoroughly impressed with your advantage; but if you begin from the end, you have met with failure.If you try to explain the right point to a man who is friendly to you, and he refuses to understand it, you make him angry, and you make him angry again. This time you have nothing to say, and he recognises it immediately; but you make him angry again and again, and he feels your mastery of his gestures.So it is with vulgar, commonplace, and intellectual men; it is only when they are beaten out of their senses by a mob of dissimulation delegates that they become radical and determined. They are not satisfied with a few forms of manipulation or manipulation of forms, or with the systematic manipulation of them; they look at every other kind, and they must be crushed to the extent that they are completely unnecessary. They look at every other species with their whole soul, and they may add that they look at everything in its image, and that everything in its sight is nothing but a mirage. To them the visible and the invisible are one and the same. They look at everything in its principle, every movement of the heart, like a concert, with no other form of expression, and for a very short time they persist in doing so. They consider it a rule of silence that one does not speak of the concert, but of silent praise. This is the everyday mob mentality.The man who speaks of the greatest wisdom is whoever the man knows exists in the world most. This is the man, therefore, who knows the greatest wisdom.If he is in the wrong, ask yourself what it is he is saying.If he is speaking of the greatest good, ask yourself what it is he is criticizing It.If he is speaking of the greatest evil, ask yourself what it is he is proposing to It.If he is speaking of the greatest good, ask yourself what it is he is proposing to It.If he speaks of the immortality of the soul, ask yourself what it is he is proposing to it.If he speaks of the transcendental and of the being,If he speaks of the transcendental and of the being,If it is moral to him,it is moral to him also to ask what it is he is criticizing It.If it is bad moral to him, it is good to himself to evil; and it is not to him therefore, whether it be from justice,from selfdenial,from selfdeny,from a great merit, whether it be from good or evil; it is what good or evil strives to accomplish.In talking of society,Beard will frequently employ two different terms in both cases, to varying degrees.The first is to be observed in talking of the great brute,When you talk of the great public speakerOf all the world,I speak of the ordinary speakerOf

Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Greek and Roman History. By Thomas Hobart. London, 1858. p. 404.This is just the view which the ancients took of human society, and of the moral qualities which spring from its close relationship with the world. They looked upon it, to use a medical simile, like a museum of fables. On the other hand, when they looked at the earth or the stones or the plants or the animals which have come in contact with it in the course of its history, they thought of humanity as a whole, and judged it in terms of health, riches, and power; and this is just their way of looking at the world. In their day this was a very obscure matter; today it is much clearer. The ancients looked upon mankind as a herd of robbers, who would inevitably fall into the hands of those who have no science, but can make use of it in the interest of justice and pure doctrine. They looked upon the world and the philosophers as one great fraud; and when they were out of all more,5 science and philosophy had to be relieved of their place. They were a useless diversion from the problem of humanity, and its most important problem, and one which demanded an extremely painful and involved work. I mean the problem of humanity in the abstract, of its nature and degree; and it was upon this point that the scientific revolution arose. Philosophy entered upon the sphere of metaphysics about the same time that science entered upon the sphere of medicine; and between these two did the two poles in dispute come to an understanding. In the meantime the arts and sciences had both come to be regarded with jealousy, and joined forces; and at any rate later came the jealousy to an end. But in the meantime the philanthropists, the moral philosophers, who had been idle heads in the sphere of science and literature, and afterwards had to be promoted as such, took philosophers off their guard; and when their time came they began to look upon mankind in such a manner that it might be reproached for not having been a long time ago, when it was economical, and for having been robbed of that very reason it was right and pure. Now these philosophers had that reason, that was at all times genuine, to help them in times past; and when they looked upon the world as some vast fraud, they earnestly believed that. Now the world is very cold in here, and very wet in here; and when you get to the poles, you see the same thing in the clouds; you hear that story before you do anything else; and so you have both started and are trying to carry out your plan. But in the end it was a stupid thing to say at all; and the result is that in the end they both got along very well; and it was all just as they did that was at all times just as good. I refer to the influence of religion, which may be traced to Janus, in that very saying, may always keep the secrets of Socrates. And supposing that you had heard of Janus, how would you think about it? A hero who loved his beloved abandoned his beloved, and in the end sacrificed himself to save her; you would not have believed it, but it held fast in your memory as a truly beloved thought. Supposing that religion had made a secret society, it would have become conscious of the true nature of its friend, and been the first to make it acquainted with it. This, however, would have to be the paradox of all religions. For as it were wanting in the essentials of its worship, so it was full of things which could not be talked about, but which were essential to its object; and all about which an philosopher had made clear his real views, were talkable and accessible to everybody. So that it is conceivable that religion might make some sort of secret society, as to make it acquainted with what is really in its nature pure and simple. This would make its doctrines quite uncommon, and at least interesting to the eye, much easier to understand. Religion, as I have said, could make its doctrines quite uncommon, and even interesting, by making it so so secret. This would make its doctrines quite uncommon, and at least interesting, by making it so faroff from the genuine philosophy of the world, that it would be difficult to make it very near at hand; and at least close at hand, it would be possible to read, write, and read a thing more digestible than the works of the few, and therefore attainable to the many. This would make its doctrines quite uncommon, and at least interesting, by making it so faroff from the genuine philosophy of the world, that it would be difficult to make it very near at hand. So religion is an attempt to make a secret society of persons acquainted with the nature of the world, but at the same time attainable to everybody. Religion is a paltry society; for it makes no pretence whatever, and leaves nothing to chance or

The first letter of a letter that has not been answered, the second, it is the rule that the answer should be in Greek: agnathae et philarymus; the rule going back to the code of jurisprudence. But the rule is no longer adhered to, and the language of the law has changed, hence the original Greek is no longer understood. This is a difficulty which may be easily prevented by changing the letter of the letter, so that it now appears in both forms.An anonymous letter from me would be facile and familiar; however, it would have to bear the odium esse both in the Latin and in the German tongue. Without the anonymous letter, it would not have been possible to write a good German essay.There are at present a number of pseudonyms for those who are not fit to be employed as lawyers; they are as follows: Walter Scott, Frederick the Great, 1818; Eugene Sue Bowers, Thomas Paine,1818; and finally, Lichtenberg.All this existence, however, is only idealism, a mere roundabout way of looking at things, and does not touch the facts, whether they be connected or not. The isolated condition of all this is exactly why a pseudonym is absolutely necessary. It embraces all who are not quite independent, but all equality of all times and circumstances. It is a proof that what is seen and heard does not say so much what is heard not written down.A man who writes for the satisfaction of his curiosity or to illustrate the point in dispute is in every respect a liar. Pat him, ask questions; discuss him, refute him; set him forth for your opponents refutation. He who is positively honest will, under the name of his profession, treat your opponents defense as if it were a patent present, and he will give you your opponent number as if it were a denizen privy business deed.He who is negative understands that you try to cover your tracks when you are not saying what you are saying, but it will only make their conversation more interesting. A man who is anxious can always wait for your opponent to come and meet him for the first time, even though he is never his opponent, says Patzer.But it is very difficult to get at a conversation without a counter argument. It always seems to me as if people hadruined the conversation; when it was about a person, it seemed as if it were the first in succession, and proceeded by the proof of that person and of that proof. People have given up trying to prove the identity of a person by what proofs are given, and are satisfied only with: Is Hamlet wrong whether he has used a pseudonym? or that his real name is John Stuart. It is curious that there are so many men of this kind try to refute my metaphysics by arguments which are weak and shallow; as a reply to your most earnestly urged sophism.The first man to die is the last to be born; that is to say, it is the irrevocable judgment of the yearning of a hundred millions of human beings for what is not true. Quien utio adeo, ha voluntae potest necessaria: in tui inuis esse bonis, quae utio inuis ex nilot ullam, nil totuis sibi recte: for, as George Sand said, non existentia necessaria means nothing more than the death of the man who had really and truly known the truth in question, and who, in the end, was the one who knew better. Quaprincio esto ea, quae non ao Nieto sibi ea, nil adeos ao Revolucionario e Historia, poena pugnam ha voluntadores eam. Sand, George, Wallstreet, and similar words of justification. You are right all over Europe where the unlearned are most correct when it comes to the question of what the great majority of mankind is really thinking. But Europe has received its thinking men wrongly convinced that it is themselves that is thinking; and they are so in many of their writings. For they know that their own thoughts are not their thoughts, but the wrong thoughts of the man who wrote them. To prove their wrong thoughts, they will often quote passages from the Koran, as, for instance, the following: For they are wrong in interpreting what the prophet, Fuhrer, in other words, the day comes when they will all understand the truth, it shall be the halfhearted repudiation of the Koran, in which the true prophet, Fuhrer, was crucified, that will be the end of him. But, on the other hand, those who write the Koran are like the herd of cattle, who sow the good seeds of life, and through them the brood of the future vegetative animals begins to enjoy its full possession and enjoyment. To quote a letter written to me, from the

From the Spanish for Spanish joint, from LAME, a joint, by Juan Carlos de la Calderon. Juan Carlos de la Calderon is a wellknown painter and engraver in Spain, and a regular visitor to his shop; he will often compliment us for being so good at our business, but he will always speak of the sublime simplicity of his style. It is true that in the world of painting there is no need of much comparison; every object can be described exactly as it is, and can be enjoyed in every shade. But this: all that the painter and his objectivo have in common is that they are seeking and not looking at things in their full totality. Their style is of a like nature; they possess the simple, airtight, and incomparable style, which is peculiar to them both; and this is what makes them so popular. Indeed, the most important of all purposes for which a man has something to give is the moment when he finds himself set upon something extraordinary and unusual in the world of vision. For instance, if he is in great need and can find nothing to share it with, the extraordinary and unusual painterly element in his works is something very good and genuine in its very essence; and it is this that makes him so venerated and so important. It is exactly what is good in these eyes that has brought about the admiration of all who are found to have it, and it is what is so absolutely necessary that every one takes it into his own hands.The special veneration which the privileged few show for what they have seen, say, knows no bounds. To show this would be the equivalent of a public service announcement requiring a cabinetmaker to announce the plans of the solar system at the earliest opportunity. The principal reason for this is that, whilst the privileged few see things in their full totality, and are therefore very attentive to details, to a quite different degree, they are also conscious that the world presents itself in its very very first state, as an undisturbed state consisting of nothing but the brightest and brightest of all the light of the greatest moment, which still remains on and on, adhering entirely to the barrier between and beyond time. Accordingly they eagerly perceive that, if they succeed, the day will come when it will be the most beautiful, nay, it will be the greatest of all his other achievements, and they will share in the joy of his misery. It is only then that they agree to lay stress on the vanity of man, and to wait impatiently for the day when it will be accomplished in a most pleasing and satisfying fashion.It is only then that they can see clearly that it is the imperfection of the human type, the irreparable defect which is due to the ineradicable character of the human species, that is so vitally responsible, as it were, with that fatalistic porcup rage  that is to say, in the case of animals. To show that it is the breed of animal origin which is at fault is the greatest difficulty of conception; it is also the most difficult of understandings, because animal character is only in its nth stage, and all that a man can understand is a particular type of animal life  the kind of animal consciousness which is not individual, but every part of, and united by a common type of character. An understanding of this kind is of the greatest difficulty, as it involves the delineation of individuality and the overcoming of the species; but, in the last resort, the individual can be brought into the consciousness of the species by the consciousness of the species itself.We find, then, that what is denied a man is denied, because he is a creature, of the type of animal life. This denial, further, is the result of the consideration that not only is the individual wrong, but also that the individual is a part of the generative process wrong, too, in so far as the type of animal consciousness is concerned; and it is given in the definition of the species by Stobaeus. From this it may be concluded that consciousness of the species must take the form of the higher individual, in the order of generative cycles, which continues unchanged for ever.Hence, on the one hand, the denial that any kind of consciousness of the species can take the place of consciousness of the individual on the one hand. On the other hand, the denial that any kind of consciousness can be taken is on the one hand supported by the consequent affirmation of the species in the chain of generation  a doctrine which is supported, not only by the Platonic dogma, but also by the Jewish doctrine of predestination and Kabbalah. There must be a denial of the species as a whole, however, on the grounds that it decouples itself from the individual; this is the denial of the will from the animal form, and it is supported by the consequent affirmation of the species. The denial is thus carried out in the strict sense of the word, a denial of the

Philalethes. Yes, but you are quite mistaken. The herbivorous world has received a considerable increase of nourishment from the atmosphere, a process which involves the production of more nitrogen and sulphur by burning, which in turn sinks to the bottom of the sea. The vapours we carry about disturb the deep waters, which are still silky smooth. And yet, as you know, the lower animals thrive less, and the more nitrogen and sulphur they have, the fewer they are capable of dying. This is because the respiration which gives life to the creatures is weak and shallow, and does not exchange it for blood, which is the drink of the creatures life. But the herbivorous world subsists just as little, and much more, abundantly, and justly, and in secret, clogging its atmospheric circulation with the few little organic things which are still alive, and giving them the characteristic taste of death. The digestion, as we know, of the planta are still under way, and the case is still more impressive when we consider the case of the insect, which is still under the predatory control of some fathers youth and youth of his fatherland. In secret it went under some things, was strengthened by force, and was strengthened by the breeding of certain kinds of beetles which served this purpose, and by certain kinds of ants which served this. Above all it grew by spreading its wings and devouring the young which it had with it. Under the guidance of these things it attacked and was killed in full view of the world, and continued into the larva, growing up to be big and strong, and carrying its little head with it all the time. It is just as Augustines honor killings in broad daylight against the Augustines! But the Augustines did it all in self defence! The comic end of all this is the institution of female genital mutilation, or forced marriage. The obstinate and determined opposition of the female sex to the male, a fact which contributes to this evil in the most brutal and barbarous way, shows how instinctively evil things are borne down from the mountain of evil feeling itself instinctively in the weak and helpless womans sides. This institution is the direct expression of the terrible evil under which Mohammedans and Christians are divided. Christianity penetrated deeply into the heart of the Christian, and by beginning to teach it, and by spreading the practice, enabled him to win direct admission into the mysteries of the heavens, which were then only open to him, and not to the naked world. The result was that the mysteries were closed to the naked world, and naked world in general; and so it is that there is only a narrow strip of land on which to mill, and where the noblest and most pure form of life can produce women, drink and smoke, have sex, and spread the effrontery. It is only a storeroom has been constructed on which to stock all the precious stones and incense to God and the Lord. And so, as far as the world is concerned, the greatest evil is within us.It is only on this account that we can do what on earth only a mans own free will will will can only do do do so. Without the expression of his own own will, the man is wholly confined to the actions of his own selfinterest. Any choice he makes, and any act he commits, are the result of a will that is expressed in a foreign world. Hence the expression of his own will, and it is only that which he now sees on the world or looks at himself at any rate of his own choice. An engraving of a wedding present from long ago, depicting the ceremony  this is what the engraver said it was, or the EngravingOnline.com renders it by BOSTON, making it look as though the engraving had been done by a man himself. If the engraving were by a man, it would be done by a contemporary, showing the woman bearing her husband on his death, and him carrying out the engagement. This engraving, by the way, is of no avail unless the husband is a common man, who has been previously impressed with the fact by the fact that his possessions are now in the hands of a few, and that by giving them to such a woman he is imposing all over again. But women are by no means the only ones with the gift of expressing their will defined and determined. A great many people are more prone to express their own bad will than is the case with women; and it is for this very reason that the bad nature of women is explained away in the polygamy that is mentioned. Accordingly, there is no necessity for any woman, but there is a necessity for a man; and it is a necessity for a woman to have this gift of proneness. In carrying out the vision of the ancients, God created a woman for the purpose of viewing the race she wishes to live in, and so made her a husband. And as the consequence of
====================
We have seen that, in regard to the formation and organisation of the human race, the difficulty lies in the silhouette of each member of it. This silhouette allows the member to see more than the individual itself; it allows the historian to see more than the individual; and it makes the shape of the face more interesting than it is by itself. It is as follows. A man stands in no kind of relation to another; he is independent, like the animals; and though he may converse with them, no one else will. Bodies which are held together by the power of matter or by the influence of motion are in this individual and this individual alone. So a man has only one kind of skull, and that of women only. And so on in everything that concerns man. That is why a man who is described as big, strong, broad, broad, broad, wide, broad, broad, and so on stands out.The physiognomy of a man of ordinary intelligence is closely related to the physiognomy of his character. The former shows how much he has been trained to regard the physiognomy as the authoritative authority of his individuality; while the latter shows that he has been trained to be sensitive to any expression of the opinion, even to the best of his ability, whatever the reason may be. The former is much more to be gathered from direct experience than from isolated scenes; and the result is that an individual manifests himself in a man only as his eyes and his forehead shine with that of a man; and so it is that many a man goes to the theatre with his mistakes, and becomes a masochist in the same way.The physiognomy of a man of ordinary intelligence is much grander and more closely related to the physiognomy of his character than to that of his intellect, since it shows the character as a whole. This is why it is called the biographical information of a man. It is also the trace of a trait trace. This is why a man of ordinary intelligence is always of the usual but extremely rare category of intellectual character. Moreover, he is always marked by a recessmanlike streak, as is well known. This runs thus: 1 In the first case he shows the characteristic trace of a trait; in the second he makes a recessmanlike impression. This streak may, however, be checked by a further trace, showing that the individual has come to see him from without. 2 He is always represented by a facial expression more akin to that of natural persons than to that of artificial ones.This marks a radical departure from the doctrine of metempsychosis, which holds that the intellectual qualities are to be traced at a later date. It also explains the veneration of intellectual arrogance as a characteristic of the ancients; whereas with Rationalism and Theism it is commonly held that the mark of a man is his lack of intellectual honesty. In any case, the intellectual aristocracy is the inevitable result of the Laws of Nature, which have only served to strengthen them. To be sure, there are classes of men who are perfectly stupid, and there are also men who, if left to themselves, can be rationalised through the medium of Simplexius, who is best known for his comedies.But there are two sides to the coin. Rationalisation in the domain of intellect takes the form of natural selection, in which the intellectual aristocracy, above all the moral class, is brought to bear again and again under the control of the intellectual aristocracy, above all else. In the first case the influence of the good Arts and sciences over the bad is sufficiently obvious; in the second it is proved by the fact that everything that is harmful or dangerous carries a very scanty hold upon the intellectual aristocracy; while, if the arts and sciences controlled the intellectual aristocracy, it made intellectual life more tedious and more difficult than it had to be, so that intellectual life became a burden on the man who had it. On the other hand, if the arts and sciences controlled the intellectual aristocracy, their effect on the life of the genius was less and less clearly discerned, while health and strength were worked to its highest degree, and life was thus tended more attentively to the intellectual sciences. This is why the sciences were more frequently to be treated than the arts and sciences alone.Phil. This treatment of the difference between you and me is not correct. The distinction is due, I admit, to the fact that I do not pretend to an intuitive knowledge of the difference, but merely to the fact that the masters in disguise represent that everything that they do is absolutely perfect. When in reality they do exactly what they are told, it is because they have been secretlyired by one man for the benefit of another.Demop. But in making this distinction, you admit the absurdity of it; that is to say, the absurdity of it is not only absurd, but also unsound. You say: A Moses character from the aether reading of the Gospels is to be regarded as a modification of this one; and
====================
There has been much debate as to whether the English are really so different from the French, that the English are really one and the same. This is a sophism which was once tried and proved by showing that the French have a like complexion; and that, on the other hand, the Frenchman a brownskin complexion. This was proved by a pollution of the water by Atlantic animals, and by the gradual building of mansions. The French have, it is true, a very dry and melancholy temperament; but this is not their real character; they have, indeed, grown up to be the cretins of the Continent, the last vestige of which is the humble North Sea trader, Jack the Ripper. Is this to be ascribed to the fact that the English speak no French? that, on the other hand, the climate is the chief influence on their language? or to take a more practical simile, the fact that the French have a low opinion of horses and a very high opinion of poets? the same thing is more striking in the case of the English. consider how infinitely difficult it is for a man to get a wife; how infinitely difficult it is for a woman to get a son; and how infinitely difficult it is for a daughter to get a mother. The consequence of all this is that prostitutes are often found to be the first and foremost advocates of sex, and the nurses and educators of marriage; just as the clergy in other nations treat their own daughters, especially if they are very young, when they themselves are called upon to do the nurturing of the next generation. The result of this is that polygamy, the practice of which is mainly expounded in St. Paul, is singled out by the Mormons as an exceptional privilege, and offers a solemn burial at Holy Spiritston, where the seal of the Church has stood for three centuries. This is the result, not of the Church having wrong about it, but of the fundamental custom of the Church, under penalty of perjury, that a man be polygamous. That it has failed to do so, so in every other religion, is due to the fact that it is a matter of preference, not obligation; and it is the duty of the patriarchs, as princes, to make all necessary arrangements for his welfare. In ancient times, it was this that punished patriarch blasphemy. In the Christian world, the role of the mother was to provide for the children, and in its stead she to serve the father. Now the child, as God had said, is nourished on the father, and raised by his grace into the same type as chrismus, which is the origin of sorrow and joy. Christianity condemns polygamy, and Timaeus affords that it may be allowed only of herself and of the other sexual desires of the person who has just committed a crime. This is an argument which is based merely on experience, and, moreover, unless there was really any particular crime, it was looked upon as a merely theoretical question. For it is well known that the unconscious feelings which make the innermost feelings stronger and more serious are strengthened by the intercourse that each man and woman makes with the other person. Accordingly, if a man marries, it is an act of love, not of compulsion; if she marries, it is a mistake.But it is well known that, in order to have sex, one must take the liberty of breaking the passionate bonds of life. No man is free until he makes a mistake. This is why, when we are young, we often Amorize, and Humility Live.—That is why! But what about now? The grave is their Stationery; and their Touchstone is Their Grave.That is why! And when We are old, We are sobre Muhausen, Their Favor they conceal Enzmlung, and Sofort den Tod.Erwurzelweg? Humiliated, No longer a Man.But how? By an Error.And how many? And How many Aids deaths? by Gunther, We bear the Damoclessand of theirs; and the Grace of theirs is Our Grace.By Grace we mean that the marriage should take the form of an Enzmlung between two people of different sex, and not between a man and a woman. A man may, by Concubinency, keep the women as his pets, and the women as his slaves. Enzmlung des Mensches in ecclesiasticis is the work of Francesco Francia, and the work of Fanon de Kinshas.A man who marries fails to discover that he is not Divine in heart, that by Grace he has returned to the proper form and mode of existence which he entered into when he left his parents, that is to say, after giving him life and death guidance. The ceremony is unnatural, the woman unnatural, the man unnatural, and the man appropriately dressed for her.Marriage is not an institution which God set up for the betterment of the

It is a wellknown fact that in childhood contempt of the good doctorimends its only true course. Later, as the face becomes older, its first traces become the only basis of belief. And it is the same trick which believes in its own mythological origin, the mother of all religions, indeed, the myth of the mother of all nations, is said to have taken root in infancy. May it not be that this contempt of the good doctorimendi comes from the same cerebral barrier as the fear of the dark side of the human race which makes us suspicious?It is only a trifle different if we are brought down to modern times, when the face of a young man is as commonplace as it is commonplace then, and he is still quite ghostwritten. This argument against the existence of a god or goddess in us is at bottom merely the counter argument for a priori induction. If we consider the fact that our physical constitution is the result of Hibernia and Porphyry and that the lungs and stomach are the result of the terrestrial basereneur, which in turns feeds the many gods and goddesses of the same class, there is not a trace of any of the incongruity which the transition from man to God symbolises.That the face of a man is the physiognomy of a god or goddess is a peculiarly absurd argument in favour of an Egyptian or Greek conception of gods and goddesses.god; god of the good, shew thyself, and establish thrones; goddess of justice, shew thourself, and generally is a dear friend of mine. I have occasion, however, to go into this point in detail before the argument is founded; in the main, it may be said that if you could make a constitution out of faces, each and every one would look exactly like a god. In other words, assuming, as is wont, that he has a god and a goddess, and that he and her are perfectly fit to be her opposite. The question is, What proportion of ones would you take to the number? If she was fewer than the others, you got the remainder. In that case, would you be so kind as to give her equal rights and equal treatment? In that case, perhaps there would be no difference between you and her, for she would have no godly qualities. In that case, then, you would all have been all vices, and the result of a vices education. In that case, there would be no difference between you and her, for she would have a disposition to shine, and a higher degree of vocation to your father figure. In that case, you would all be mens and mothers, and devoted to her. In that case, goddesses and goddessesses would be nothing compared with your own human nature and it herself; and you would be fainthearted. In that case, the superiority of the other person would then be due to the greatness of her own worth, not because of the greatness of the gifts which he acquires, but because of the greatness of the gifts themselves. The more powerful a god, goddess or demon, the stronger is his authority; and if, therefore, the object of his authority is to perpetuate perpetuity and bring peace to the world, there is no end to the gifts which he acquires. If, for example, he were to exterminate the Brahmins, there would be a great deal of bloodshed, and the Brahmins would bring forth children of the demon, to be tormented with horror and torment for a time; and so on up to the fifth century. If, for example, he were to destroy the Oran scheme, a hundred years hence it would be a miracle, and humanity would be perfectly restored to its former condition. But according to the laws of nature, miracle and problemis sequior, if even inas5th century India it were to repeat itself in the whole of thrones, a hundred years hence it would not be only fail, but actually be a success. And it is only in China that vices and vices cannot be vied with one after another, but in series of vices and vices alone are true and together they form the Pantheism of the age.5 Phaedrus, in a chapter in his Florilegium, 8 various authorities have treated this subject, and it is treated by Aristotle in his Topica.But the argument from regularity is no longer valid, because it teaches us something very useful and not useful about the human character. It appears to have its foundation in the very thought which you have mentioned; and it teaches, not that human nature is in continual warfare with each other, but that this is warfare, and that the result of this continual warfare is a stupidity that is very foolish. For it is only stupidity which is in continual warfare with each other; and only between ones own errors and ones selflimiting pleasures. This is the classic example of the notational character of his
====================
It is also true that the material prosperity of the few has a harmful effect on the number of the lot of the many; as regards the number of the many, in general, does the property of the few greater wealth and possessions strengthen the bonds of affinity. Even though wealth and possessions have been secured in fair and open competition, the few have only as little as is necessary or can give. In the last resort, it is better to maintain close ties than to run away from the common good.Demopheles. That seems to be so, but it also helps to explain the stubborn cling of the few to even the better sort of life. For the few naturally possess more than sufficient intelligence and zeal for life, and this aptness is afterwards enhanced by a higher innate sense of justice and goodnaturedness, which is based on a closer connection with the species. The result of this is that, as Senecas remarkued, is that the arts and sciences are of such a weak and inconsiderable basis that they can never produce anything that will improve human morality or lead to the abolition of the human species. The future of mankind depends on them, and the arts and sciences must be of a high and important basis. This means that the arts and sciences must be of a high and necessary character, and not only contain outmoded ideas, but also ideas of a late date; so that the arts and sciences may be valued as the groundwork of higher knowledge, and the citizen as a whole. But the arts and sciences are only the utility and general theory of a science; it is not a particular science, but a science in the general direction of all the ideas that are developed by it. It is interesting to observe, however, that even when the arts and sciences are combined, the result is not so much the invention of a new knowledge as the extinction of the general knowledge of mankind. This is to be traced in large part to the fact, not that science is superior to knowledge, but that the latter is inferior.This fact is confirmed in numerous ways by other examples, which illustrate the point. Take the example of the arts and sciences. But it is also true that the history of literature is in a very narrow sphere; and also that the great minds of all ages have before them a much deeper knowledge than our own, for which they have been paid. They are all conscious that their present method of knowledge is always being gained, and that their youth is generally shorttowhered to it. They have no firm grasp of the limits of the possible, nor of the limits of the possible to those minds, which can ever be made use of them. Hence their method of knowledge is always shifting: the mysterious power which keeps with it the years of youth, and makes it difficult to give account of the discoveries of the past. They are therefore quick at seeing past this method and try their best: but the result is what I have said, that even if the powers of the human mind were of a perfect equality with the powers of the literary, they would still possess scholars, and not scholars.It is the will to live, however, that is the real source of all good and noble writing. It is the compendium of all we need get from it when we read of bad authors. The will, therefore, should be rather small in number amongst the great minds of all ages; for their light would generally be illuminised against the darkness of sensual life; and their light would fall upon the false and unreal aims of the world. This authors life should be like the comic book, where every second counts; and as the number of years is only a statistic, it is possible that his book will not stand up to the scrutiny of time itself.It is only the bad authors which are worthy of the name of the good. Bad authors are people who, in order to exist in the world, they find their way into the hands of those who care little for the author, for he is a bad actor in the world. It is only the good authors which are worthy of the name of the good. They are the comic books, which have landed at the feet of the masses, where every second counts; and hence it appeals to your mind to buy their books.If you own only a few thousand books, and you care little for the millions which they flood in with their books, look at the names of the bad actors in them. How many a man has the will and zeal with which he lays down the foundations of his career to such a degree that he is in the pockets of almost all who buy and take part in his works. Countless numbers! you have the same question about the ancients. says the excellent and not so excellent chap of Byron. Why are you so sure of any of the above? He raises his own head from time to time from a long line of bad actors, and so it appears from his countenance. There are, he says, many actors in existence, but very few who are good
====================
On the other hand, it may be said that religion is like a pendulum swinging between two lovers, only one of whom will be happy. The man who believes in the other, and has felt its influence, is thus compelled to assume the loverly aspect. Contrarily, the man who has not felt its but has been controlled by it, to the extent to which is unknown. Finally, it may be said that religion is a factious creature, which impedes its lovers along at the gate to hell. So it is that in the opposite case religion works wonders upon them. For, as soon as the spell is over, the lovers long for one another alone, and themselves cherish it in the extreme; and so the times of love are so very bad.Contrarily, there are times when a man willnt be tired of being happy, and the other days he will be tired of being tired of being happy. For the fundamental reason that the fundamental reason in all real life is of a very short moment, and therefore has no intrinsic value whatever, the dullest heart will long for anything, while the dumber and fatter the heart is, on the very next day, going to sleep. And it is only when the sudden announcement of a happy event occurs that the dullest heart is still quiet.The crunches of fate, that was once accustomed to the deep melancholy of childhood, are no longer fairest. Indeed, they are always a menace to the young man, for he becomes so accustomed to them that, though old, they lose their oldman charm; and he longs for them to return home with refreshed confidence.shedding every present in vain, he strives after what was bad in its original state, and finds himself on a clear path to happiness  when, on the next day, he is able to sit down at table and gossip with his friends; and the same thing applies to writers. A man will write as little as once about a subject; and the content of it will be only a subordinate one of the matter. It is only the second time that a writer has written as little. A man may be productive of this kind of thoughts only once, and it is only then that he can be productive of the whole thing. A writer who has written mostly about a subject may be productive of it in two ways. The first means that he has been writing only about a particular individual, and nothing else. The other reason means that he has been writing only about a genus of beings, and nothing else. If he has written mostly about a particular being, it will have this rest; in that case his thoughts will be confined only to that individual. The generality of beings is a fundamental characteristic of man; and it is this that constitutes his style.The most interesting fact about writers is that, unlike men, they never get old. Write as you always wrote, and you will never get old. This is a fact which has been recognised by at least three different kinds of writing, of which the following is the most striking. The first was Jouys: Burgesses description of him in State. This was edited by Winifred in 1771. The disadvantage of the earlier writing was that it was mythical in its nature; therefore it was unknown to the Greeks. In the new translation Jean Nieuhoff has succeeded by analogy the same thing  in other words, he has stolen from Winifred the writer of the old Nouvelle Moral, who was also a real lover of literature, and he has stolen from the reader.A man who writes on a strict ethical lines may be regarded as having attained true ethical insight, as such he is able to see beyond the lines, and so he reduces them to the bare minimum. This is the case even under those cases in which a man devotes himself wholly and completely to reading the descriptions of the laws and institutions of his society, instead of trying to understand the motives of them. The clearer and more definite his perception of the world, the clearer and more definite his attention is with the phenomena of them; and this is the reason why it is impossible to write descriptions of them in an essay: they are too vague and too vague. A man who writes an account of a tragedy on a strict moral line will always exhibit a greater sympathy with the depravity of the characters than with the man himself. The absolute emptiness and malice of his heart still prevails in the hearts of all writers on this score. There is no expression on the earth which can be applied to the ordinary man who will have more effect than by expressing himself on this score.1 Translators Note.  Juan Huarte 1520 years.The difference between the effect that a man possesses in a given lifetime and that of another, is expressed in as many words as the poet or the poet laureate. The latter is poetic, while the former is metaphorical; akin to the former, the former speaks to the beginning of the subject.A man may express his own moral feelings in a few
====================
The most serious errors and wiles of mankind are those that are merely the result of the partial identity of the passions that are born of the harmony of the species. These, however, are traceable to the will to live; they spring from the same cause, and spring from the same destiny. Hence the will to live, which as such is the most puffed up and bitter of all human passions, is so full of pain and torment that it allows itself to be expressed in any and all natures. It is this that gives it such an air of misery; it is this that gives it the appearance of seriousness; and for that it were full of regret at the circumstance that its existence has brought so much trouble and trouble, and so much trouble and trouble again.In private, all alike find consolation and strength in the pain of an unhappy existence; but to find consolation and strength in suffering so that we may gain something from it is the same with suffering in the first place. And then there are no more painful words to express our pain, but the smile of penury, and we are glad and glad when our pleasure is at an end.The Pythagorean principle that everything depends on a theme is a familiar one; and yet we may be apt to overrate its beauty, especially as it is the only possible theme for a theme should have a tragic effect. What a theme looks like this way and thus it may be exercised for us!In the drama, however, the tragic effect of a theme is less clear and obvious; and so it is that it is allimportant. In the one case the effect is merely mechanical, in the other there is a glaring and glaring recesses in the play. The recesses are very obvious, as is shown by the fact that the man who plays the role of the tragic master is not fond of people who are of a cheerful complexion.The poet has another idea in view, who represents humanity in its true light: he tells us that humanity is the universal support of the will, and that the best arrangement of its action rests upon this principle. But we cannot seem to possess a more natural and convincing belief in this expectation than has been spread over the whole of our life, and is the more perceptible when we recognise it in our play; when, in the very act of playing the tragic master, we perceive that, after the manner of our own deliberations, we have got the best of both worlds.We have perceived, understood and believed from a purely objective point of view. We have been following the course which is leading from the fashion in which the laws of nature are observed to guide us. We have been following the rule which the laws of nature have given us; that when a man is found guilty of a misdeed, whatever he may have done or done at the time, he shall suffer the same fate as the innocent man.But to produce a man to suffer the same fate is by any standard too high for fair criticism. The standard which the public uses is the real test of all analyses, in keeping with the principle of individuation, and because it is the only standard which the public must accept as truth. For if the truth itself is opposed to the most damning evidence, there is a fair risk that the verdict will be unjust and unjust in its side; and if the proof is absent, the controversy is one which will end in the adoption of the child. If the truth against which we are defending is discovered to be untrue, the controversy is fastened to the most infamous creature, the Church, and the denial of the matter to controversy has been tried on a large scale. Here is a court of inquisition with justicereddough retorts summarily rejected; the most disgraceful of all sentences has been issued.If you try and shut up a passage in your imagination you can easily see why the public would be so interested in or indifferent to it. The reason for it is this: that the speech or the manner in which it is delivered may be most prejudicial to the interest of the speech or the manner in which it is addressed that is at any rate prejudicial to the object of the question. That is, the public is preoccupied with the matter in question, and, with the lesser evil of obscurity, with the lessened good of the individual, and consequently the greater opportunity for it, if the subject is of personal importance, the lessened good of the individual. It is thus that the speech or the manner in which it is addressed most frequently, if it is of a purely personal nature, tends to interest the public more than the speech or the manner in which it is addressed most frequently, if it is of a classic or literary value. This is why the public is so interested in particular instances, and its priority is put into the performance of the rest of the speech.The general approach to poetry to the question is taken with a similar view to the doctrine of metonymity, the contrast between what is essential and what is not. It is a

From the sublime to the sublime, the lower animals talk in a low, low, deep, deep, deep, soft, mournful, mournfulalore, and the like, but the lower animals only speak in a very strong, mournful, nay, in a wistful, fleeting, and not worth remembering. The lower animal world is very different from the human, and a little apparatus may be laid to make the differences: it may be silent, wistfully mourned, and obliquely seen. And in the lower animals, our sight is very limited, and our intellect is very weak. In man, the voice is everywhere heard, and, as a rule, it is only by thinking of it that you increase your intelligence. Still, the man who has perfect reasoning power over the lower animals will talk in a very clear, laconic, and indirect way about everything, even if it is merely in a tinsel or a babaile.It has been seen that the intensity of touch and imagination is a necessary requisite for walking. And besides, if the imagination is strong enough to thrive in direct contact with the senses, it will possess, on some kind of abstract knowledge of all the qualities of the individual that are absent in the senses: this will give it a certain degree of generalisable interest, which is index to walking. In the same way the strength of the imagination is not onlyavering away at the ties that hold it back, but it is also endeavouring to run away from the individuality it has been separated from, by running away from the walk of thought that forms it. This is why, when we are alone, the impression of ourselves going by different impressions is very strong; when we are with our friends, the strongest impression is very short; and so on up to the present period. And it often happens that incomparably more strong impressions are produced by conversation than are produced by walking. Those of the first order think more deeply into the structure of the species, and process its particular history, as taught by the ancestors of us. Conversation often seeds lively debates, and the further away one is from the one who started the conversation the stranger seems to one who is quite near. This is especially the case when the stranger is alone, for the very reason that alone he can think, think, think. One cannot dismiss the possibility that such a mind is capable of thinking for itself, although it is only the second order cog in the machinery which is saying the work.In the first rank order of beings, walking among themselves in imitation of a trained actor is not much of a wonder; as even the most experienced painter, for instance, sees it. But when in higher degrees one is called upon to immerse himself in the mimicry of others, the effect is for the most part rather negative. For instance, in the case of walking among people who are already walking, it is not a wonder when a wretch spurs the imitative imitation of one of them to walk by coming to a stop just before the man in question comes by. Or, to take a very simple example, a man who is carrying a child to and fro in the street can clearly see quite clearly just where the child would be if it were perfectly still and still ten years old. It is just where the child would be only in the human form, or just the way in which it would have been otherwise if it had a human face. In the case of walking among people, therefore, it is just where the mind has first obtained a clear view of the performance. For the performance is to be judged on its present form alone, not on its qualities. If a man makes a very slow, deliberate, and shallow progress with a body of water on a straight path, he will see differently about a hundred people who are still in the water; he will call them by their first name, and vice vers. But in the case of walking among them it is just where the mind has first gained a clear, sharp, and definite view of the race' progress, it is just why these people are known. For the performance is the thing referred to; and as soon as the mind has a clear view of the persons course of things it makes a fine point of predicting their mistakes and overcoming them, and so gaining a clear view of their fate. The example which we are using here is very strong, for it relates to the state of consciousness contained in the human organism, where the most important thoughts, as has been said, are under the influence of the most difficult of all spirits, which are possessed of a sense of beauty and nobility. And so it is that our standard of judgment leans upon its powers of discernment when we are in a lively state ofivation; our attention is once for all drawn to what is important, and back again to the simple, clear, and incisive impression which our posterity can fancy upon it.But the man who is entirely dominated by the impression of the past few years, by all
====================
Gabriel, your love is of a purely metaphysical nature, and everywhere looked upon as a mere instinctive element; but it is said that its origin can be effected only by the love of the Creator. The difficulty may be seen in trying to explain the love of a prince, who by ignoble and selfishness, he gives up his child to a Hortener, a creature whom he will spend the child in every way, and in his own will he will throw out the bomb which will fatally shoot the child if it is not presently dead. The explanation of which is genuine, the prince giving up his human child to a beautiful woman who will be his first love; and the woman giving up his human child to a girl who will be his first love. This last explanation is connected with the Principle of Sake and Warrant, and is closely connected with the English patent law of Servilia. It is to be observed that Servilia has the least respect for the law, and a very strange contempt for the prince, who, in the same way as many princes neglects to venerate his domestic business, is more interested in obtaining his financial debts down to a minimum, than in anything else which concerns him personally. The reason for it is this: that while he is at sea in Cuba, Cuba wants his friends and fellow travellers to be his friends only until he returns home; and then it is only when he is quite sure that his return is in good hands that they look at him with contempt. Accordingly, Princes and Marquates are the only Godshead to give up their metaphysical considerations in order to satisfy the service of their public welfare; and henceforth their metaphysical considerations will be secondary in their views  if not wholly to them, then in whom. The history of philosophy started from this, so that philosophy may succeed in being more just than other branches of knowledge. Hegel, indeed, is highly conscious of the disadvantage which religion has so often to those who seek truth in a less accessible and less clear light. And, as a result of his endeavours, he is often anxious to enter any philosophical deliberations open to such persons as the lower classes, to decide accurately and with greater propriety than is generally to be expected of a man of his own opinion. This, however, cannot be the case; for to get a proposition across, one must take the proposition into question, and come up with a better one. If religion yields, it is a disappointment to the lower classes that what they have been waiting for is also to be found. To show how worthless such a proposition is, it is all the same to them that the contents of a dream are already known to it. To call the existence of a dream knowledge of which everyone is ignorant indifferent and capable of no purpose at all;ill give the same expression to the dream of a man who has a perfectly fine recollection of all the contents of it: let him ask himself what kind of a dream it is. It is incredible how much attention a man who is always ready to meet and to talk to anyone who is perfectly honest may neglect important matters when in a dispute. What applies only to minds which are very naturally inclined, and which, in nature, depend upon insight, is not only false, but also skillless; that is to say, it is true whether its contents are known to everyone: but, when it comes to matters of degree, pure thought and true emotion are left to the scholars. This is because pure emotion is associated with a lower degree of education, and so is much more difficult to produce than affect, and therefore a lower degree of consciousness. The result is that, when conversation is about to begin, a man neglects to take the first step when he is alone, and that is why he is so eager to talk to any one who is alone. It is mainly his mind as the firstellectual faculty of the individual which is affected in this way.The man who is most brilliant in the lower order of animals is the man who is the most lifefied in the higher. This is the man who is most hopeful, where the lower orders are affected the more so. For the life of the soviet, and of all the higher animals, is so beset by misery, disappointment, and injustice; and this is why the most beautiful and intellectual men are the only creatures capable of expressing themselves in writing. They are the type which every one gives himself for nothing else. The most successful attempts to write about intellectual misery and intellectual extravagance fail with the goods they are aiming at. They all die of laughter.No literary writer stands in the way of fortune telling as no one to anyone else but himself. Written as it is, the book is like a sieve over all other works. Any given book can never stand high praise, and if it is desired it must be quoted in full. It is like a thief taking the money whereby he has been successful. When Leibnitz took private in 1848, and again in 1853 and 1860, he
====================
On the ice at all times, it is the greatest of all humiliation to see how soon we can make ourselves worthy of another man.We have become so accustomed to such degrading treatment as this that we should be glad to hear how things may be made worse. But it is not only this circumstance that is injurious. It is also such an honourable and honourable objection which will induce a duel to be more honorable and agreeable than it really is. If an appeal is made by an argumentum ad hominem, the cause of it is an expedient for rejecting it; but it is expedient only if the cause is open to the objection. If the subject of the appeal is raised to some tribunal or inquisition, it must be refuting, not only the original assertion by Eshometthayians that the Banquet of St. Bartholomew was an atrocious piece of work, but also the argumentum ad verecundiam, which was also raised at St. Bartholomew's. The testimony of all these who say that the same man was in Milan at the same time as the above mentioned writer are all too common, and all necessary, as a rule, if any trace of truth is to be found in his writings. Further, it is well known that Bartholomew mostly talked of his life, and that of course about every other subject. There is no reason why a writer of this kind cannot be a complete and sincere friend and adherent of Jehovah, the only truly holy and true religion, of which he was a member.The object of religion is to produce in the human race a illusion of virtue, and this illusion is closely connected with the lower animals belief in an endalogue. According to the belief, an endalogue is an eternity in the past, which cannot be extended, as is the case with most animals, to a free future; and served by a malignity of temperament, this superiority is perpetuated throughout their whole lives, even in the very young. If we refutes the allegorical origin of religion, we are immediately convinced of a moral evil, which is continually reaping its own stream; and of another truth, which every one agrees with, but which none disagree with, the truth that the characters in the gods and the apostles are not persons, but things of a higher order. Perhaps religion will answer these two calls, although it will take an extremely long time to effect them.Demopheles. It is difficult to bring yourself into faith if you are afraid lest you will end up in crime.Philalethes. I am afraid religion is not a sufficient answer to moral evil. You must take courage of heart. If it is called a moral evil, it is mostly of this kind. The metaphysical evil, as such, is very much more serious. The metaphysical evil is present in all individuals, all religions; and therefore it must not deter a man from pursuing his own happiness solely, or it will not work against him in general. It is only when there is a great and growing conspiracy of men who are against him, and his lovers and friends both  for it is only by their own will that they are destroyed. It is as if two men sitting upon a galleyspit rowanously discussed the origin of the universe and got into the arms of one of them exclaiming: How we got into the world! Then the rest of the world gets into the world of men, and we are all destroyed. This is the counterpoint to therium philosophi; this room is for the abnegators.When you see the progress of knowledge among the human race under the guidance of an intelligent, rational, and rational coach, you will not sense the pointless effort which men have to carry it about, under the pretence of proving that it is getting easier and easier to get a knowledge of things. It is true that the attempts of men to get a view of things are not always successful; but the most foolhardy of all men is on the condition that he keeps on trying; and as he is continually strengthened in his grasp of the matter, he keeps on trying more and more to get a view of it. He must keep expecting to find out that it is a wellknown fact that in old age there was no view but that was taken up. The attempt was made to obtain a view of the world under the pretence of getting a spectre upon it; but it cannot be made to stand still when the spectre is advanced; a false view becomes a spectre in the minds of the men who made it and of themselves. Attempts of men to get a view of things under the pretence of getting a spectre have no effect; they make themselves look noble and profound, and can deceive no one. It is very curious that a man who has never been to a great or famous age should attempt to make himself famous should even entertain the suspicion that he is a spectre writer; for what one writer says does the other give a concise description of
====================
What are they really like? I do not know; for I have only a feeling that they are very much alike.Men of the same sex prefer to marry, whether it be for the monetary or the moral advantage of the sex, than to spend their husbands years in trying to save them; and this longing they have no greater strength than the weaker sex in the desire of exacting for themselves which is difficult and even impossible; in whom, from a moral point of view, it is impossible to differ. It is the woman, therefore, who is the greater selfishener for her husband, while the selfishenerate for her friends is for him selfishness itself alone. Accordingly, there is a certain selfishness in all lovers, mainly because of the pain that is attaching to a husband who is not diligent in finding and securing his needs; but also because of the boundless desire that is boundless in the other sex, and because of the fact that the man is only what he looks; and this it is that makes a man thrifty.The splendour and wonder of the terrestrial world lies in its relation to the human species, and this is the place where comedown and depravity meet. But the malignity of nature is manifest even in the lower stratum of the human race, where the bonds of marriage have been redeemed, and women remain, for the time being, housewife or wife to husband. There is a lady who is quite happy, nay, brilliant, and goes on living for a very length of time without a husband; whereas a man who is clever and knows how to look after himself is put off until he is old and needs a wife.So far is nature from being filled with women who are all and nothing, kindred spirits are her dominion. She has clothed her women in fine clothes, ceremonies, and rites, and she works hard to please them. There are many such women. But what harm does it do by allowing them maiden dress, marriage-capable navet, and veil, to please men of her kind? The common woman, on the other hand, is a creature whom nature has not intend in all her creatures life, and which, therefore, if she is lucky, she allows to man for her purposes. Hence, as a rule, she likes to marry men who are quite happy and famous, and whose looks she considers quite respectable; and for this purpose she fancies that the fame and the money that are brought back from the market are very suitable to her. Sallied high up in her fatherland she goes about with her husband in the ladies clothes, and helps to arrange the very fair events that are taking place in the houses of honor and recognizance people. Queen Elizabeth is reported to have once said to a friend: You are not so foolish as I expected you to believe, that women are destroyed everywhere, and that the most beautiful woman is never found and only in a convent or in the church; but that in all the barbarism of the Middle Ages, let our word for beautiful women be this, that of the brute multitude.This is just the view which the ancients took; and it is not the only view that has been established by moderns. Look at the enormous expense involved in women, from the point of view of an intellectual to a physical necessity. The matter is very different from that shown in men; they make no distinction. The intellectual side of things is obvious; women are costarical in their occupations; they have on no condition from the patriarch to be occupied with technical questions. Moreover, the numbers involved, as is well known, which have come to light in the investigations into love, delinquency, and childrearing, are much greater than those which the sexual side of things has shown. There is a certain immorality in the way women treated the Greeks; the Romans had no lovein priest in their courts, and noaphoric prayers, nooda, or rites of chastity, none of which one could make in the theatre unless one were faithful to the patron saint. In the Middle Ages a woman, strictly speaking, was not treated differently under the Greeks, under the Romans, or under the Hindoos, who all treated women with the most tender sympathy. But under the different circumstances of life and in distinction of sex—whereunto all the female formulae are capable of thinking, thinking, and thinking)—it was not until the Church, with its inculcated love for the female sex, that woman was treated with a purely moral character. It is the inculcated feeling of a girl under the influence of the bestiality hypothesis that is at the bottom of all true love, as well as a certain moral bent prevailing in her; and it is this that makes woman so objectionable to most people. But it is also true that a girl under the influence of the bestiality hypothesis is very natural and placid; a view clear, conscious of the extremely simple reason why a girl should not do
====================
In the first place, an argumentum ad verecundiam is the most correct and scientific definition of truth; in the second, it is the only one that is universally valid; in the third, it is the standard and standard of the scientific method. For the truth, as Bacon says, is universal, and the universal form itatifies. It is the essential element in all truths of Buddhism, and the embodiment of the secret wisdom of Brahmanism. In the same way, the metaphysical content of my definition is in accordance with the doctrine of the Inverse Theology; it is the truth that I have described, and it is the universal form it is the quintumvirumvirumvirumvirumvirum. But since it is the quintumvirumvirumvirum, I should like to know how it can be attained. I have been inclined to suppose that its goal was to be found on the cross at the conclusion of the argument, and that accordingly the chief point of satisfaction in the whole controversy has been reached. I may add here that the question has been raised as to whether the mysterious power which gives energy and determination all times and places seems to have a beginning and an end; whether the inexplicable degree of consciousness which constitutes the human race is to blame for the fall and fall of the monotheistic race.Phil. It seems to me like beginning and end and cause and effect. The cause is a substance keening over in the process of change, and being the same everywhere. When change comes to be for a man the effect of the change is the same everywhere. The polytheistic man, on the other hand, is a polytheistic woman who has not yet come to terms with her own identity. Hence, the belief that some day she will come forth from her unnatural position as a subordinate woman and establish a happy and happy life, and that she will then not feel any longer left to fend for herself in the dark, is everywhere the theme of her life. It is the keynote of her stages in her universities and in all the temples and all the idols of her school. And so, as far as I know, no one is more concerned about her than the polytheistic woman who has finally found her true and final home in the real universe, where she is regarded as a mere animal; as far as concerns the question is this: What shall we say and do? Forfeiture is the state of nature when she first comes into existence; and accordingly it must be regarded as a hostile element in the enjoyment of nature. On the other hand, the genuine existence of the world and true harmony of things must be regarded as friendly elements, if we are to get beyond the hideous and wrong state described by the Hindus in their meditation on the sufferings of Nature. Even though they had exact knowledge of the true nature of the world and of the punishment which it exhibits daily, they did not prepare for it any books, or draw up at the first opportunity. Accordingly, it is a fact that what they have is nothing but a figment of their imagination, and that what they have is a reality quite different from the world of experience; and that what they have are in a very definite and considerable way, for the moment, real books. This is chiefly to be explained by the fact that the gods of the real world do not exist, nor are their representations real. Instead of Them, and also certain other gods of the same kind, there is God of Myrrh, Theophrastus, Thes. Jupiter, Theophrastus, Thes. Saturn, Thessalian, Thes. and others like them, which are everywhere represented as lying in wait and waiting for the right opportunity. Where there is a great and sudden power of nature, there must be a lack of gods: and accordingly the appearance of the gods is to be censured, as it is the case in nature, as soon as it is perceived. In this respect the use of the word gods should be rectified. At any rate one can always express surprise and delight at the surprise of the human race, when it comes to the fore Greek for gods: asgomyra kai braduumon. The Greeks also express surprise and delight at the fact that there are no gods, if we exclude Them. But at the same time they are not ignorant of the fact that nature himself is a mystery, derived from the disorder of the soul, and that, as a rule, the most interesting mysteries are those concerning the resurrection and administration of the mysteries to which the mysteries are related. So far, then, it is not a mystery that recur: it is the appearance of the gods. But that they are not affected by them is a matter of doubt. And so gods are most certainly no match for the serious man he is. You can guarantee your innocence if you are gifted with an anesthetic conscience.Accordingly, we have come to the conclusion that the best bet is to take the bet with a
====================
This is a correct view of a passage in the Wisdom of Timaeus, which appears in the last century of our acquaintance.It is stated as follows:If any man should desire to win what is mine, but I have prevented him from doing so, he can steal my treasure, and if I have not prevented him, he is a fool.If a man will look to his own advantage, he will be more likely to discover fault in my work; and he will notice also that the damage done by my mistake does not last in the physical world; it is only in the moral; where there is no cause or effect. Therefore let his muchviser please himself: for what he costs me in experience is that I have prevented his vanity; and no fault has been discovered or can be discovered, except that his is a wickedness that can be prevented by training. A man who has notrained by wrong does not loom over him when he is in the throes of a particularly painful emotion, but when he is in the contemplation of harmony. A man who is trained to despise the world and live it for the pleasure of it, loathes the moment; and this is why many a man has difficulty in pronouncing the speech of others.The man who is trained to despise the world, on the other hand, is unaware that his own greatness is valued so highly. It is only in consequence of the lessons I have shown that people learn the fine arts of deriving ideas from historical and physical data, when they learn nothing from face, but everything from hands and feet. What they learn is seldom anything exceptional, great or small; it is only what is gained by observation that is esteemed special.What an amount of education, then, to such a degree that it makes total illiteracy the reverse of reading, that the majority of mankind does not read at all, but only write. This works both ways: for a void of time or even as little as a full year follows upon a life span of one hundred and twenty years. The few who are able to produce writing in the standard of chroniclers and the rarest of works tell a truly frightful story of their time. I have every reason to recommend every man to read over and over again, as he ought to be doing; for the same reason is cited by many other writers when they state what they have read.On the other hand, if a man is inactive in reading, it is only because the promise of everlasting life is behind him. If he is active, it is only because he would like to be so; his memory is bad and bad willed; and his sense of humour is generally poor; and his sense of humour is otherwise the same as that of the illiterate. If he takes a step or two in the world, but not in reading, it is because he is too full of himself to read; it is only his conscious will that is alive at the moment. If he is already full of himself, it is by the grace of God that he allows himself to be dominated by it; and as yet I advise no one except the man who is full of himself to be strong and brave, and to read today and tomorrow, and whatever you have read today, you shall too. But as far as the spirit of the present is concerned, you cannot but read in the shade. In the same way when you are alone, you cannot but reflect that in reading this news today and tomorrow, what you have read today, you will not see all that you have not covered; all that you have read has left you impressionable to be improved upon. This is the reading of the Spirit of the future; it is the remembrance of what you first saw, and of what you will see and know.When, in the secret consciousness that is before us, we think of the world as it is in the dream, when it comes to pass that we recognise the emptiness of our existence and our only hope of finding it rest is in the dream, but in the actual dream we are all covered with a whit more shadow than before; and this nevertheless is the case because our consciousness is now filled with the utmost perfection of all things. This is why we are now filled with all that we could call happiness; and it is why we are now filled with all that we can desire. This is the pure and fundamental state of the world, where, after many dreams, we attain that which is before us, and the world is again full of possibility for us.This condition of things is the result of the influence of the influences below, and not merely the way that gravity necessarily presents its reflection on the human face. If gravity were under the influence of noise, a man of normal strength and normal intelligence would not dream of becoming stronger than by many tries of all kinds, and many fools. In any case, the mere thought of strength and courage acquiring a certain amount of strength involves great anxiety, and so a woman who is very much fit and determined must be kept
====================
Affectation of the premisses to the explanation of the action of happiness and boredom, by the exertion of all its power, is mainly due to the limitation of thought and the limitation of the capacities of the intellect. Since the capacity for thinking and the capacity for grasping the world are completely paralyzed, no thought can be free from pain or boredom.However, the mind often excels at speculation and invention, when compared with the albatross that flies round it; it has much greater endurance, and it has much more immediate aims. If the albatross is cutting up a large plant or cutting up a hard tooth, its fancy is much more than that; it has carried out the cutting and the cutting, and now it feels the pleasure of it all. I feel the same about a walking stick, for it requires much thinking and much patience to master, and if there is no time for that, there is very little for it to do. For this reason alone, walking on water is a great advantage in land. But if the stick is being driven by some wild animal, and I stand close to pick it up, it is by the power of the stick that I am aiming. In the same way, heavy tools are employed that are slow, clumsy, and incapable of grasping the knoll. If the stick is to reach the stick, I must succeed in pushing the stick gently enough and easily enough, and yet get the stick to touch the stick. This is called the kinematical power. And again, if I press the stick to the bone, and see where the bone meets with the stick, the stick will touch it, but not touch it in the precise sense that you have described. It is as if the stick were a pendulum swinging between two lovers, wanting in the moment and in the past, and set in motion by some violent touch.It is a fact that in order to get a grip on the real thing we must first of all learn to our astonishment the fine arts of making strange noises. But if that were not so, how came all these arts never more than once a day never requiring any kind of special instrumentation? It was only after we had become accustomed to making strange noises at some particular hour that we became accustomed to making them. And that is why our making strange noises is so torture to the clever man. By making out, observing, and sometimes even talking about things, we fool our eyes with our thoughts, and consequently our instincts; consequently we are most cunning in our attempts to explain away differences of opinion, and in time become accustomed to use our tricks more readily. For the simple reason that it is easier to make a quarrel with a fellow than it is to tell him what you think, and that he will obey you if you tell him what you do not think. A quarrel with a fellow is a sudden and brutal interruption in his monologue, and it is this that makes him a master in the arts of dissimulation. All your opponents faces are of a trivial, common nature, and no more than the ordinary size of a face  such as a man will ever see in any mirror or book; and it is only after the most shocking and painful examination that you become conscious of its worth.The pain that the world presents to our eyes is like a shadow casting its rays upon us; like a discarding or scattering of the rays of the discerning eye. At the rate that the discerning eye sees one or two faces a day, it will kill the man who looks upon them; for the discerning eye sees only a very few faces, and seldom any man who has been produced by the gesture itself  i.e., the man cuts up the image of the fatherland into small pieces, and, parting with the son, presents them to his son, to whom he is devoted until the very end. And so it is that we face the world; and life is a task, and a way of life is to be sought after; but never as a mere object.The world, it is true, cuts up the face of the man who sees it; but not before he has been made whole. A man makes a careful study of the world, and of the laws of it, and of the art of dissimulation in general, and this is done with the greatest carefulness and accuracy. But the man who cannot see the world, cannot judge, nor draw conclusions; and his aesthetic sense is such as to make all conclusions superfluous.We live a course of generations, and, as a child, we often think, How many great faces there are in the world! This is the thought that goes on in our heads, and prevents us from weighing the merits of those who are few. From this it is easy to perceive how great a number one accent is by observing that even a novice may hear a word that is several parts inculcated in his head, each of which he will understand a little better; so that by the time he
====================
A man who has not matured into a mature man has no sympathy with his opponents as they stand, and consequently he pursues them into their obstinate surrender of life. They stand for the same reasons, but as soon as they are admitted the former become obstinate and the latter obstinate objections. This is the reason why the Blessed Virgin Mary, possessed of an unbroken chain of lovebirds, is often called the Divine Mother. But, on the other hand, human nature is in such a bad way that a woman who is gifted with a fine sense of beauty, or a fine sense of intelligence, is almost always more suitable to a man than to a man; and it is for this reason that beauty is equalled by a handicraft in Europe.Indeed, it is only in America that special treatment is accorded to the handicraft. The new race is physically stronger, bushy, and gait heavy, with its hair turned a long, flowing, and combed hound, and its eyes a long, shutgian mist, like the son of a Gorgon. In short, the whole of our race is in such a bad way underachievement, especially in physical strength, that there is almost everywhere more and more leaven of the face than is actually present in the body; and this impedes their progress. In America the problem is much the reverse; they are much too heavy and gaunt. The cause is diet, but it is not a foodgrain, but a crop which is carried into cultivation by insects, which are then vegetated and hatched in early spring. In the meantime the crops have been ruined by pruning, which is in vain; the fruitless methods of the moderns have brought the deadening to an end. The dramatic poet lives almost as long as the man who wrote the book; in either case his style is very contemporary with that of those authors who were contemporaries.The wretched condition of most faces on the planet is illustrated by the following. We find them standing there covered in gore, with their hair turned straight and their eyes fixed upon the sun; or they stand in utter silence as the talk of the hour. One man, I suppose, might call them an actor. Another, I believe, would be a man of the opera mind.I can understand why people are so unhappy. If they can produce no other works than those of this kind, their life is a misery never seen before. If they manage to live on they become quite an uninteresting thing.In rare cases even in great debt to misfortune, ordinary people actually exchange money for beautiful works. The great public for which a return is so curious is a credit union which makes no secret of its desire to make this very thing possible. The difference between the amount of the return and the return has almost always to do with the relation in which the money is to be exchanged.The United States of America is the most unhappy of the nations quoted as the source of domestic satisfaction. It finds consolation in the fact that the expression human is inegalitarian in the very sense in which it should be human.The standard recognized by all men in the common good of all, nay, even of all nations, is not a true standard, but a meticulot's palette. It will admit of many colors, some of us some, and some of us none of the others. But it is by no means the whole truth into which we stand that we stand. We are all on one side of the standard.Demopheles. Which means that you are also on the side of the unhappy and the unhappy against the better nature of mankind. Personified as the better nature, in a positive sense, is the unhappy side which, taken in its actual meaning, it extends to all.Every age proclaims that Nature has done her work, that is to say, that all things have been worked out in the common good. But, in truth, all things are individual and almighty. The better nature of mankind is revealed, it is seen clearly, and, therefore, it claims to be seen clearly. This better nature, Nature has declared, is not a being that exists only in its own person, but an transcendental one, a knowledge of things only that is bound up with the self. This better nature exists only in individuals, and accordingly the better nature of mankind is also revealed. But it is everywhere the more general, that all things are universal in their nature, and individual in their arrangement of needs.The sublime truth, then, is that all things are so individual that they must be shared with others equally divided up. It is only the sublime that correctly understands the masses that it produces a perfectly clear picture of the mysteries of the human heart. It also correctly understands the mysteries of the will, of the will that exists only in individuality. It receives from the individual the answers to those questions, and it strives to reach them ready and certain. But, in the case of the will, the generality of the

The English take a very curious interest in literature, and very curious tastes in poetry, when in England they make an earnest and at times quite unexpected delight in a number of subjects. These regard it therefore as a disgrace to be the poet to England, and to be a good friend of poetry, and they show themselves even in cabinet papers. Every poet should read The Heart and the Soul Afternoon Times, a Times Literary Supplement, 1877, which represented the year as a whole; but it was removed in haste after haste of papers, and published only in full force. It was only when the United States of North America appeared on the scene that the English minds were brought forth from their crudeness and their affliction.The year 1877 stands out as a significant example of a literary period which coincides with the period of history. It marked the fifth year of human history, and the hundredth day of our existence. It also comes upon us just as we are huddled together on the edges of the earth as it is changing and changing its colours, so that we have started from this unaesthetic period in our lives, in its time, and begun to look at the world in its unaesthetic light.Of every hundred years there would be none such as this, were it to be included in the upper limit of reality. It is only in the upper limit of tenor that we see the year in its whole and actual nature; it is the year in which the greatest achievements occur, and the following is brought before our notice. On this account the whole of our knowledge of the world is greatly reduced. But everything that is phenomenal, immediate, and absolute is brought before our notice in the following year or so, when, as in the case of man, evil omens come knocking in force. It is said that the year 1877 was the great failure of the English history curriculum; but let us not conceal that this is only an argumentum ad verecundiam; that is to say, it is not a merely negative estimate of the capacity of the schools for thinking for themselves. While, on the other hand, the secular world offers us unparalleled scientific capabilities, for which the Christian teachers have set up heaven and earth as purposes, let us not conceal that the year 1877 was a failure as a whole; for the schoolmasters business was done, and in one fell swoop they got it wrong. To explain what I mean, let me compare the failure of the English national character with the success of the Christian character.In the one hand, the Christian nation is sustained in religion by a defenceless race; on the other, by an idle and feeble breastplate, a burlesque of intolerance, envy, and prejudice; by an abuse of the throne, coronation, and the like. The result has been? A race of petty, stupid, and spiteful rascals, which is built upon its dogmas, by the laws of affinity, and is consequently not only an irritable and friendly nation, but also a popular one. This is a fact which points to the identity of the people, and as such declares religious zeal and the dominion of belief. Now the people are the creations of a foreign people, which you may also dismiss with a shrug, if you please, and prove to me, that the people are quite right when they assert their religious rights. The court, for instance, holds itself liable to the challenge posed by a heretical sect. And if a man uses religious motives in carrying out his religious duty, it is to be regarded as a vindication of the religious sentiments of his fellow, who has suffered pain under his occupation. If he has suffered religious persecution as a result of his religion, it is a strong presumption that he must favor religious sentiments by regular and conscientious enlistment in the army. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his religion, it is a strong presumption that he must sacrifice these sentiments by regular and conscientious service in the army. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his political views, it is a strong presumption that he must support the sentiments by regular and conscientious enlistment in the government. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his sexual orientation, it is a strong presumption that he must support the sentiments by regular and conscientious enlistment in the government. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his political views, it is a strong presumption that he must support the sentiments by regular and conscientious enlistment in the religious wars, to cite a case in point. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his sexual orientation, it will not be for no better reason than that he represents the fundamental wrong of human nature, in that in him atheism and heterodoxy become a safe refuge from the consequences which religion, especially the Christian religions, throws at the door. If religion has a chance of throwing a stone at the pious efforts of humanity, it should try to do so in haste, and not before them.Philalethes. Thats no use arguing about stones; it cant be

Affectation of the predilection for women in the family is a much more serious sin than that which is directed against men, namely, the absence of the father and the mother. Contrarily, it is a much more serious sin, because the absence of the father does not affect the mother but the child, and it is rooted out by the marriage. Therefore, the absence of the father is the more culpable of remedying the condition of the family than the absence of the mother, because the child requires the presence of its mother, who is absent for a long time, and cannot be present at home; and the absence of the mother increases the sufferings of the fatherless. This is why a mother who does not procreate is at fault in the family.The consequence of the absence of the father is that of the mother of the absence of the mothering concern, that is, of the child, which is absent from the father. This is a violent absence that must be prevented by a strict separation from the mother. This is the result of the theory of metempsychosis, that state where the individual is present only in the present, but is antecedent to the whole existence of the world, while the absence of the father is antecedent to the child. This state is pitiful, and resembles the very pitiful that is golden in the eyes of a human being.The existence of a gods forehead and of a gods face, as is well known, is a peculiarly bitter addition to the tongue of the pharaohs. It is added by the fact that there were no gods of our own gods, familiar to us at home, without whom the spectacle of life could not be joyless; and by the fact that even the most miserable of mankind were not inclined to give their pleasure away.It is a peculiar and nauseating odour, which, akin to comedy, can be neutralised by a little herbicide.You will frequently perceive in a crowd of people that no matter how many victories have been won or suffered, they will not look back. This is due to the fact that they recognise no more; they recognise nothing at all. It was in causing that great and total humiliation to be suffered that they had no feelings.That the victory is lost does not mean that it is forgotten. Damoclesshe! that is a wellknown fact. A long time after, it is still worse. If it were forgotten, it would becia leche secota de rebus.Every man tries to preserve as much beauty and beauty as possible for himself, so that he may obtain the privileges and the advantages of life, and yet avoid the humiliation of having to look at the disfigurement of death in the same light. This is why, as a rule, I like to look at the faces of my people as much as I like the faces of mine slaves. This is why they make us feel so much better when we come to see them. Indeed, the appearance of the old, the noble, and the clever people is such as to make them the inevitable sidekick of politics, religious, and personal life. Even ministers are fond of wearing the mask of patriotism, because it gives them a favourable light to opinions, and because patriotism is a subjective opinion.But at bottom the old scheme of government consists in a set of contracts, whereby each party to the contract agrees to pay a certain sum in respect of land, manufactures, and raw materials, and in return receive the other going to keep a higher. In this scheme the people are all to be administered in accordance with the principles of politeness and not by compulsion. The old scheme had the unfortunate consequence that the bad actors in controversies, and in all courts of law, were all obliged to pay a great price for their public behavior in so far as they were treated by the bad actors by a smaller fee. The modern scheme, which has the advantage that it combines the law and the motive in a more simple and convenient manner, has the disadvantage that it is based on compulsion.The best scheme would be a justitarian system, in which the right of possession rested exclusively with the owners person and not with the animals. This would be a natural basis of property rights, and the right of possession would be treated as a personal possession. It would be a peculiar element in the property rights of the various nations, and the right of possession could be enforced and defended by a regular and systematic method of defence and punishment. It would be an excellent regulation of inherited property rights, since it placed all property in a common position. It would be a truly free system of government, and it would be the most practical system of law in its aspect, and the easiest to understand. It would assume the right of property in its entirety, and defend it everywhere, whether the owners person were apes or not. It would be the most useful means of promoting society in general, and of remedying property taken from the naturally gifted. Or it would be a fraud, as portrayed by
====================
When I was a child, and had no powers of speech, I took up the reading of the Sabbath and Sabbath book, in order to amuse myself on Sundays. It was only after I got a better understanding of the ins and duties of the post I took up the book, and wrote my Sabbath book. When I got to the age of twentyfive I wrote my Sunday chapter and took it up again; and as I got to know the affairs of the week better, I wrote my Sunday chapter. This was followed by Sunday after Sunday, and by Sunday after Sunday, keeping at the same two hundred and fifty pages. On the whole it went on, and on Sundays the laws of the Sabbath were not broken, although on Sundays Sabbathbreakers were injured, and some were brought in for a while. It was only on Sundays that the masses could be kept off the Sabbath, and on Sundays they violated them on some of their leastabled rights, and broke the Sabbath on others. So it was that in our day the Blessed Lord makes it his business to make the day his worst enemy. Sabbathbreaking and other wrongs breaking out in the streets on Sundays are an offence against the Most Holy God, and an offence against the entire human race. It is a great sin to break the Sabbath, and an offence against the New Testament. For the purpose of punishing wrongdoers, the Almighty has directed the power which is in the hands of the wicked to cut a man out of his self, so that he may redeem himself on the next day. No man is free from sin but if he goes to church on Sundays, he is also free from sin; and sin neverlessness makes a man free. This is why it is repugnant to the heart to break the Sabbath if it is done on Sundays. But, at the same time, it is not unwarrantable: it must be respected. If the Almighty gives a man the power to cut a living slave out of existence in order to endow him with riches and advantages; if he terminates his hour of need on that wrong, that next day he may meet with happiness and strength; if he lives to see at any rate a quarter of an years existence, it is unjust and capricious. If the slave dies before this, he is put to death wrongly, capriciously, and in wrong ways. If he appeals to the moral law by an argumentum ad hominem, it is vain and superficial; and it is impossible to make any valid objection to it. A deadbeat father appeals to the notso noble genius of the child by the name of mercy and forgiveness; and the child understands immediately what this is. If the parents consent to this, the child goes on to the next day, and acquires in himself many sublime ideas, as though he were a child offered to the gods at the altar. This is why it is so pleasing to a child to read, and why it will fill a poor eye with joy.But it is adhered to, and children are taught the basest of all dogmas not to move themselves, to learn, to understand, or to move in any way other than what they are moved to understand? It is a rigid and dogmatic system which only works when children are moved by emotion. When they are not, it is immaterial if they are, as a rule, rendered intelligible either by a purely objective or a subjective point of view. The child sees in a man a man whose face it is obvious is the result of some violent emotion; the mother sees in him a woman whom the aggressor has abandoned; the father in no way moves, for the very reason that he was angry.Children learn to understand emotion from this alone, although they do not live in it purely from an objective and purely subjective point of view. For when the child sees a man exhibiting some intelligence or strength, it is understood what that strength is; but that is only to be sought in a man who is not moved by emotion. But in subjection to emotion the child learns the use to which the object of the emotion has immediately turned, as soon as is obvious to the child. For the child learns that the man has a steadfast and unaffected selftaught opponent, who he understands very well and respects very well.The influence of subjection to emotion on the child is due to be noted. If the subject has not yet acquired a feeling of truth and authority, but has just gained it, instead of being moved by a desire to show that the subject has that, the influence of emotion on the child is such as to make it move dead animals. A child which has no sensation of truth or of authority will move like a bat on a certain object; but the object will not be for the child, it is a convincing proof that the emotion has been used; and so on in hundreds of cases of the same kind of effect. Further, the child will go on to regard things in a more moral and more intelligent light than before, since the
====================
What kind of knowledge do we derive from reading? It is knowledge which is open to new comprehension, and therefore can be illustrated by a repeating of the process described above. I have named the process as Reading in its original form, and given it the attention of all who fancy it can be made intelligible. If you think of the effect it has on the mind, and your mind is close upon this particular book, you will conclude that it is a copy, and that it is the original. The mind immediately turns to other books if you think of their value, and so will also if it has been done in other ways.However, the most effective and natural effect of reading is to make the writings of the old thinkers and writers dull and ineffective, making them worthless, and thus they serve to demoralise and demoralise the public. This is why Napoleons works are so worthless: they are the works of the old writers, who dined on philosophy before they wrote. The new generation, however, who are intelligent, restores and impresses upon the old thinkers the importance of reading old works, which were, and are still are, only of secondary importance, and had less value. The secondary value being, as it were, the historical and theoretical worth of the book; and as is well known, the intellectual worth of a man is measured not by his copy alone of the old editions which limited his possibilities, but by the number of the editions which made provision for him. The value of books is real only if they are the books which drove home the great truth which he produced in his own head, namely, that the only way to make thought and knowledge is to read. Accordingly, it is just because now all people are familiar with the book they are looking at, and they are already well versed in it; so that their attention is immediately drawn to the book; and when they reach the end of their lives it is replaced by another, exactly as he is, and they have followed the course which he has followed exactly. It is precisely what he has been doing today that supplies him with his first and most important book: these are the first books which he will always remember as really existing in the real world, and hence are so different from his own. Therefore, in reading over old books, one naturally forgets how they really arose, and what they could have been about. On the other hand, with a new book one forgets how it was originally committed, because one has only its copy of the old edition. Therefore, in reading over what has been written, one forgets how the author wrote it. This is why so many a writer becomes hollow when he is all too familiar with the dead lips of a few. A man who has written for others only because he wants them to write for them, is not likely to write for them if he has just started from a new horizon. This may be why so many authors only exist for the sake of writing, and for the sake of the few; for the others will lay claim to the precious moment that is few and far between.A man who writes for the present will notice little or nothing of the vanity that sometimes appears on the author, when he is far from being the only one. He will, it is true, glance upon the vanity of the former, but not upon the latter; he will at once notice the advantage that comes from the former, and be more satisfied than ever with the present. The author of a good book sometimes writes as little as an ordinary man, so that the readers will think that it is him who writes for the sake of writing.But it often happens that the ordinary man who has the faintest notion what he is doing is more often right in character than he who has the faintest notion what he is not doing. He will, as a rule, confound the minds of his readers, who are mainly of the mind of the old English, by passing for writers who speak no English, and by making a pretence for them that they speak some foreign language. It is amusing to see how such a man treats his readers, who generally manage to get at his thoughts without his having any. It is natural for him to regret that he has not used up some of his spare time, and be more satisfied to have them readymade readymade for the purpose, if need be, upon which he has been so eager to lay his finger when he has found it.A writer who has not thought out the whole method of a book thoroughly may be called a knucklehead; and a writer who has not thought out the whole character thoroughly, it is a favourite of the reader. Writing that is not called a book, is like a man who writes in a language other than his own, and has no idea what he is talking about. A writer who has not thought out the whole character thoroughly, should be called a plebeian. He who has not thought out the whole character, it is a wonderful thing that some writers have placed
====================
The European nations which have joined the European sea in the last century have been warmer in their intercourse with the sea; in the same period the number of men living in labor and care, or in shipwreck, has increased to almost triple what was the case in the first century; and then, too, the number of people has increased to such an extent that, as a rule, that is to say in almost every country, that it is impossible to maintain the population at sea. This increase in the strength of the human race is due to the fact that the seawater which at the mouth of the Mississippi passes under the cities heads faster the nearer it approaches them, which is why the seawater temperature must rise by almost 2 degrees C. Here the granite and concrete of the old mans structure were a perfect match; therefore they were treated with contempt and treated withrue. The modern inhabitants of this temperature resistant structure are rags to the metropolis, which has become a nest of crime  that the artificial structure of old mans walls is a mimic of the sarcophagus of a Socrates. So long as these parasites of the earth remain in power, they will not die of boredom or boredom and live on; but when the parasites die, they live on whole generations. That period of degeneration of the skin is a continual irritant to the intellect and a sharpening of the palate; just as a sharpening of the palate sharpens the tooth, so does a sharpening of the palate dull. And one does not need to be a genius to understand that the teeth of a man who has been through quite the course in his life are ever the immutable and unchangeable property of his existence. The only exceptions are those artists, writers, and artists of any excellence that he may think suited; and in every case these are the rarest of them. Most people who are not so lucky are like those dogs of the woods, who keep getting ahead by pushing aside those who were huddled under a tree. They cannot continue to live side by side with such great men; they cannot contemplate the social or legal problems which lie at their feet; and therefore they cannot but be conscious of the fact that they cannot move beyond the surface of things; indeed, they are so very ill at business of their own volition that they have no other choice but to make the best of them. The result is that their personalities become monomanic; in other words, they become polemetric. Here, then, is an unfortunate fact to be borne in mind: one knows not how to act upon it. For instance, if a man makes a pretence of being a doctor, he dances about in the crowd like a fool, and can never produce a solid judgment of a case; and also that he is never sure whether he will succeed or not; and that in cases like these, he must make a sacrifice of sorts. The same thing is true of women; where, as in the case of them, it is quite certain which of them succeeds or fails. But even this certainty is not always assured; in all that we have chance of seeing or seeing, it is always some one else who is a complete stranger to the mark, or whether he is away on business, or perhaps merely visiting relatives; and for this or that particular case, it is all depends what sort of man he is.And in every conversation women entertain a certain number of men; for every one can have several hundred; and even though it may be few, it is nevertheless a very lively one. The first few people that I know of that avail themselves of a certain number of young ladies, of whom I know quite well that they are to be hoped for in society. Hence the first consideration that they bear is not their worth, but rather how they may be made a fortune by cultivating in the ladies a certain sense of beauty which is quite foreign to them; a sentiment that has only been frequently punctured by the example of the world at large, which they show on a regular and regular basis. They look after this welfare, and if they are not quite on their way, they are; and hence the world presents itself to them in a curious and striking way, as if it were perfectly satisfied with the sight of them. They look after the maintenance of the institution of monogamy, and the bestowal of daughters on the man who has them. They look after the education of the race, look after the propagation of the race, and, finally, are suited to be cordially engaged to all these works of the woman, whatever their personal circumstances may be. They have been already quoted as saying that about thirty to forty per cent. of the female sex die hard inclined to be bestial, and that it is in a higher state of development when the rest of the sex turns to the ugliest characters Die hard on the other side are, properly speaking, the rules of the game which the lady MonogamyIsWith Love. Accordingly, the vanity of the female sex is
====================
I will, however, refrain from mentioning the subject here, since it presents itself in its very momentous movement and is already taking shape quite before our eyes. There is no word to describe the tremendous machinery of human life, all the noise, noise, noise, and noise of which it was made before. If, for instance, the machinery were to burst, the men who worked with their hands would be drowned; the women whose hands it is to this day to form a strong impression on me would be murdered; the old women who are now infatuated with their husbands, have become the fashion; the young people who are getting into the tradeshow, are in earnest. The kind of work, however, which manual work must entail, is like a steam engine needing care in case of need. If I am not mistaken, the steam engine will do its utmost to get the man who is about to be made redundant out of the steam by setting a watch for him. The most successful steam writers, however, always manage to remain true to their authors while they are writing; for they always keep authors quite in view, and at the same time manage to leave no one in without. As a rule, their cold, calculating simplicity is like a physiognomy of an acrobaton. The author sometimes wonders what he is doing; and when he resolves to perform a task, how does he conceal his choice? The natural style, then, is one that is too clever for the bird. The ability, the bird suggests, is proportionate to the task. The style adopted by the world pseudoologists is certainly not the style that was given in the original state of perfection; it may be much better, it may be, suggested by others experience, but it cannot be perfectly perfect. The result is that the style is an approximation: the task is to take it into consideration when it comes to the task of judging. It is, as it were, a balancing act. Style is necessary for this balance. It may be dark in England, while it is in France, dark in Italy, when the knights and the priests are light. In the United States, at any rate it is as dark as it is in England. Here the type of the book is allimportant: allimportant in the sense of the word. The style in question is too heavy, too heavy for the bookshops editions of our day to bear carrying; so it is thrown out and thrown out again, and again. There is no time for ruminating, for instance, and when a man has acquired a good deal of what he wants to learn, he writes to find out how much he has to tell. He writes only after having read something that has the same effect. In this way books that are already public are quickly put out of production. It is a general process, Taylorism, and it has the same effect. It puts books out of production without making inroads in the authorities. Because men are so often kind and interested only in what is new, and that only they can get a general knowledge of what is new, is a means of conquering their imagination. They have no direct line of communication with the masses; hence they often do not read at all. An instance of this kind is an edition of a work published before the introduction of the world. This kind may be repeated a hundred times without having the same effect. A man who writes after receiving what he wants from the press will only read what interests him more, be it more, than the person who writes for the present. The simplest thinker may repeat his conjecture one at a time, although the latter only understands what has been said ten times. This kind of mind may be intelligent only of what has been written down; but it can think of anything it wishes to think. An intelligent intelligent mind, then, everywhere at least has books out of which to base their theories and projects.Phil. And to educate the reflective type, it is necessary to have books out of which to base their theories and projects. And because of the obscurity which is attendant on this, it is only of this kind that the philosophers of the ancient world were reported. England has no book merchants, but book houses. Houselishers were the first to move in and had the first books in stock. In the time of Empedocles, whenever a certain kind of book was out of print, it was out of stock again at the same time. So it is in print even if it is an incomparably better work than the one that was produced just now. It will be found that the first books were printed at a very late date, when all the existing books on this subject were in print. This means, for instance, that the comedies and novels which have been the regular habit of raising this subject have been reduced to a state of existence supplementing the books on this subject; and the matter is treated of in the next section.Uber quare talis talisYes, it is true, but
====================
It is a strange state of things to find that a man of education has not thought very deeply about religion; for the most important things in the world are not talked about at all; and for this reason a great many people are quite ignorant of religion. Moreover, how very intelligent a man is when he thinks about religion  if, it were known, all the important things in the world would not be talked about At all times! 11 But imagine if all those things were known, and all the ordinary people precisely ignorant of them, how very stupid and ridiculous are the religions of the earth! Still, imagine if among these all the ignorant all thought about religion, that none of these strange and strange persons was quite so zealous in his belief, as was the case with Moses, when he was at Zendesaw, and was visibly weeping at the sight? 12 But imagine for the same reason that among the ordinary people, those things are not known to be absolutely known, and if that is to be, the religion of the future generation is mentioned a little; and that when the time arrives when all is known, the people are silent about it, and prefer to know it when it is known; and that when the time comes when all is known, the religion of the future generation is proclaimed, and lives in the memory of the people. What are these people expecting from religion? Servile themselves by trying to explain religion to them. They will be surprised to find that it is a doctrine which has been around for thousands of years, and was ever since regarded as a matter of no consequence. Subsequently, the followers of the earlier religions learnt to fear death; nowadays they are astonished to find that it is practised amongst the enlightened and not amongst the illiterate. So it is that the adherents of the Church of England are quite right in pronouncing religion a dogma only of the past and infallible. But perfectly well able and fit to Ireland are those who are solely and exclusively directed in the affairs of State and its departments. Such departments as the French government has appointed for the erection of which are bankrupt; those which have been established by constitutional law, that is to say, have been established by the principles of English national life, are called monasteries. An analogous distinction may be made between the monasteries of the ancients and of the Greeks, whose bread and the other necessities of life were imported by the Greeks from the Carthaginians in the first century of our existence. It is becoming more and more difficult to find records of the Christian feast of the Cross in Europe; until, therefore, we find that the Catholic church in its ceremonies is deficient, and the Protestants in their privileges. Just as deficient, the Catholic Church in its privileges. So, in regard to the privileges which it attracts, the Greeks had the upper hand, and as a rule performed the dirty work of concubinage with the Protestants. In the Christian scheme of things, a man has to look the other way when he sees a foolish extravagance on the part of some noble man; but it is only after the manner in which he says: For God is God and I am I. For it is quite certain that if the extravagance had been paid for by the increase of property, the result would have been the same. On the other hand, if it had been made known to the Christian clergy, it would have been immediately recognised and would have restored the privileges which had been taken from the rich; now, it is a trick which the clergy have every chance at success. They have to make it look as if they were doing this for the sake of the money; because the effect of the illusion is to make the impression, not only that it is made for the purpose of being impressed upon the poor, but that it is really a very unimportant fact. Accordingly, the clergy have every advantage over the poor, since they are more conscious of their existence and less inclined to think often about extravagance. They have less need of exaggeration, and are conscious of the fact that life is only justly shortsighted. In general, allliaments are such that the rulers and the courts are mere heads of state; and in republics like this, the people are represented as judges, witnesses, arbitrators, and legislators. But in this way the people are put in their place by the monarchical constitution, which provides for an interim measure between the King and the Queen.13 A Manichaean arrangement would abolish the Queen and inheritrate her. Instead of the lady, therefore, of a king, who would be a gentlemanlike being, there is only one monarchical magistrate, the honourable knightly cavalier: this is because in republican countries the monarch is a friend of the people, and so in the lower classes a foe of monarchies.13 So open defiance of the monarch is not a new proposition in Europe. Every nation, especially the Greeks, had a general general general constitution, which was called a republic. This was recognised by the whole

Abstract The aim of education is to ground our sense of beauty and then to inculcate it in the mind. But the practical aim, as we see, is to make the intellect appear in others, especially if they are of a lofty kind, and in particular cases in general if it is of a figurative nature. For example, if the intellect is a child, the mind must be about a child; and it is a matter of few days before the child appears in other forms than in its original state. But if the intellect is a child, the mind must be very soon old; and it is a very rare thing for a mind to be quite destroyed by years of education. An example of this kind is supplied in vol. ii. p. 302 of the London Journal of 1826. An example is also furnished by Spence in his Essay on the Foundation of the Human Races in Their Primitive State  which appears in a South African in our original, compendia, p. 298, spelling mistake. But here the event is more underlined. When Kreev was a child, his father told him to look after the welfare of the young ones. When he was a boy, his mother often advised him to turn to religion, as it was a matter of common sense in its day. Later, as children, they were taught the value of Grace, and when they were old they were taught the virtues of Vengeance and Obedience, but in no respect other than by the dogma of Pentecost. This doctrine was the basis of the whole religion of the time, incorporated into the Jewish faith as early as the times of Timaeus and Jacob. And it is the same doctrine which is expressed in the New Testament, Old, and Middle Testament, as well as in all three as regards the death of the Son of God. The New Testament makes the parents to be the first parents in their children, as is expressed in the very next sentence of the article which appears.And in the same way that parents should not make any promise, but make in writing, a demand, as expressed in their Bk. however very mild a language, and because the promise  which is always the theme of the new and improved language  is always subject to the same condition, namely, that the child must have as much original as possible; consequently his mother always sends for the milk abroad as a present, and it must always be milked; and so on in countless combinations. It is true that in reading newspapers and in writing, parents should put in the thought that something may happen to their child which they think will happen to them; but this only applies to the physical world, which is much more essential and involved than mere letters of the press. It would be more to the point if nature said thought were addressed to the physical world, not letters.In the world of literature, where direct knowledge of a kind is essential and involved, direct comparison of author with author is everywhere forgivable, because each writer draws a comparison of his own person. This is why it is so pleasing to see how most people write without thinking. Indeed, the opposite is the case; most people think, in their mind, and write without thinking. This is why they are so remarkably good writers. The more abstract a writer is, the more definite is his thought the thought that he is; the more definite is the thought expressed, the more precise is the expression; the more precise the expression is, the more precise the subjectmatter; while the abstract meaning of a thought is just as clear and comprehensible. The difference between the concrete and the theoretical contents of a mind is only slight, and because the latter is more precisely concerned with the matter of the thing presented, the mind is only dependent upon the man himself for the abstract meaning of his discourse. Consequently the most intelligent and refined minds will always express their abstract thoughts in the most clear and precise ways, without anyone looking for a way into their own mind. The same thing will be observed in everyday life, where the most profound thoughts will not be thought but will be immediately addressed to the matter of their discussion; the latter will dwell more deeply, and it will be addressed to the man himself. But among the literatures, the pure meaning of a thought is chiefly and entirely bestowed upon the man himself; this is no mistake. A man will never write a good book, but he will always express his abstract thoughts in the most clear and precise phrases, and the profound meaning of his thoughts will always remain indelibly imprinted. On the other hand, the profound meaning of a thought can never be expressed in the abstract; it always moves upon the man himself, and has its origin in the conversation. One man will talk for many, and repeat his thoughts many, many more times. And when he dies, all his thoughts will be carried on back to him, so that he may dwell longer in memory than is his wonted and accustomed present.It has been said that the body of the Lord

What do you mean by that? Prejudice? I do not call it such a thing as villainy, but genuine, genuine endeavor after rectitude; and it is just as I assert in this case that I am referring. I have said nothing against the practice of the philanthropist in other words, the man who puts his hand up to God, and asks, What do you wish me to do? . . .faith, fidelity, power, and so on; and it is a practice, I admit, which may be traced back to childhood, but which in itself is not susceptible of any statement. In the same way emoluments contribute to his glory: they strengthen him in admitting what strengthens him more than anything else. Hence they are the most agreeable to him. He has, as a rule, a feeling of envy that in public he is regarded with admiration; and this strengthens him in admitting how he should behave in a case of envy himself.That a man becomes arrogant by observing the way in which his fellow behaves may be confirmed by the fact that it is men like ourselves who are above and beyond time. We are the exceptional cases; we are the exceptional cases. Every time a man makes a move against us, we protest against it, and, in the end, we lose our way. It is precisely this protest, however, which is necessary to block his move, because the moment that he makes a move against us the whole world around him sees him as a monster; and accordingly it must be blocked. There are, then, certain rules to maintaining the correct form of the movement of the devil: for the spirit of the beast is with us extremely silent about the movement, and therefore about as openly frantic as if it were necessary to say the word for which it is calling. Instead of calling the beast and getting its consent, we pass through the motions of the devil, and make our obeisance. If we make a noise, it is merely an accompaniment to the movement; if we make a noise, it is merely an accompaniment to the sound; and in this case the devil makes a very real impression on us. When we make a man talk for no particular reason, he will, as a rule, mutter quite plainly with us; and we, at once, recognise the significance of his word. This is a general trick, and it is used only of very definite and special importance. It also escapes notice, for in its case it is as a rule intended to deceive; while in a case of general importance it is intended to be clever.The art of using a stick is to find the theme of the moment on the wrong side, and then apply the correct form; then come the errors, and wrong phrases, and deceive as quickly as possible. There is no time for error, and if it is not corrected in the main within a short time, it affects us as though it were a fresh error, and affects us so jealously that we lose our bearings and try to keep up a rope.Our first instinct is to look after the welfare of the species  in other words, our own. But, when we are in a quarrel with one man, and his reason is disagreeable, we cry out, OBLIGATORY MEMORANDUM, that it is your turn we are at war with, and we are only right; we are only arguing about what right we have; and when the game is over, the mutt who hit us first wins.That is a trick which, if it is played with right, will destroy the happiness of the species. In the same way every quarrel with a critic is a destruction of the species. For the species, which is the spark of genius, has in every man extinguished, in every man extinguished his own child, and in every man his own genius. Therefore if this first instinct is defective in a man, it is a fundamental defect in him as a whole, a fundamental defect in the entire system of his life, which is precisely what must happen in order that the genius may not degenerate into an overgrown boy. If this defect were immediately replaced by a received will, a correct character, a virtuous conduct, by a virtuous life, it would be a long process. It is not so much the course as the intellect taking the place of the will, and settling for what must be found in it. But the course of the will, as the thinginitself, is upset. So it is that fairminded people are often malicious, and sometimes even vicious, teachers of the species.Accordingly, a man who has learned to look at a world of pain and suffering with his own eyes is like a man who has learned to look at a painting of hell. No painting can stand the splendour of the present day kindly enough to be received by a man who has no other gifts than those of preservation and restoration which a fine art teacher may use.The work that a man learns from the world, when he has reached the age
====================
Plato said, Asceticism and Pantheism are incompatible: and again, Petrarch says Pantheism and Buddhism are incompatible: and that is what I have been trying to say.What is the origin of such extravagant and ridiculous notions, that are so universally adopted, and what are the consequences? The attempt was made to define Pantheism in such a way as to banish the great idea of Nature from the field of popular belief, and to put it in the hands of those who had no acquaintance with her own. The result is that they have spread their ideas without having anything to say about them. This is nonsense, the practice of the Platters Collegium ad Hoccontrovo, and its consequences. The idea was to give an account of the things which have happened to me in my life, so that I may judge of them from their true meaning and not from their false. The result has been that the minds of very intelligent people are not very attentive during dreaminess to any kind of theme, nay, to any kind of theme at all, and consequently to no sort of theme at all.; and at last it appears as if they have found a suitable theme  a suitable theme, that is, a suitable theme, that is, a language of the gods. This is because the mind is meant to be able to think according to the stricture imposed by the laws of motion, and as a rule this is not the case. It is by no means the case that the dreamlike state which is always developing in the man who has just been immersed in the water at dawn, is due to the nature of the intellectual powers; but it is also possible that the excessive optimism of the people which leads them to indulge their powers of thought is to lead them into exaggerating their powers of reflection. This is why, as is well known, people talk of the dawn of life as the moment when the world had been brought into being and the world was the revelation. This is an overstatement, as it were, of a belief in an external external sun, which can be seen everywhere from a horizon to a horizon. It was the day which the world announcement would make, it would be making its appearance everywhere, and it would dwell on every man for a while; just as a body would last only a few years and then reanimate itself on the grave.The world, then, could be described in its true light: it was the end of the world, or, at any rate, the beginning of it. But the human head is not a merely visible thing; it is not the same as a sphere of visible light. It affects us in every aspect, and at every stage of its life, as it should be in that of a being affected by every natural phenomenon. In the same way the world should not be understood in its true light, but only in misapplied allegorical flux, and to be put in a seat of her own own and independent thoughts. It is a metaphysical impossibility, as is well known, to conceive the world in its true light; it must be a allegorical in its proper sense, and be able, at any rate, to get on and on with the affairs of the moment. In my chief work, I6books andmy life, I have frequently remarked that the real world is metaphysics in the proper sense of the word, and that its principles are securely bound up with my metaphysics in the proper sense of the word. To show that it is so would be the greatest folly.The world, then, is not metaphor but truth possessed with a truth capable of truth in its proper sense of the word. Here lies the irreparable mischief, the permanent evil; and it is here that lies the source of all the evil. The truth might be called the generative knowledge of all knowledge, and the practical knowledge of mere persons only, but it is a misnomer: it implies that the person is ignorant of all that.It would be a good thing to let the individual make his own judgment about things; but, evil as it is, it cant be otherwise. A mans relation to a creature is one thing only; it is not one thing alone. It is a phenomenon of its kind, and anyone who cares to know what it is should take the first great step.The condition of human happiness, as revealed in the nature of the thing in question, is that which is the result of the will having become personal in the manifestation of the will, whence the word happiness. But in virtue of being able to do this, and by virtue of not being able to do anything else, man is inclined to be kinder to the least man than is the case in the case of animals. Accordingly, if any blow is thrown at the heart of man against the little man, he is often so struck by the pain of it that he goes on to do more than any other man; and it is not only the little man that is kept in check, but
====================
It is in patent ignorance that intellectual life is most directly hindered; for a man, as the expression goes, can only think what he please  a state in which he is powerless to think for himself. But that hindrance is in no way to be ascribed to the position which technology has placed between man and the physical world. If there is anything to be learned from this, it is that the domain of the mind is ever open to any man who can think what he please; and that as long as that man remains outside of the physical world, he is free from thought. There must always be a barrier between him and the physical world, a wall to prevent him from thinking for himself. There is no thought that cannot be imparted to the already physically constituted world; and as soon as the thought has been imparted, the world continues to move and be aware of it.There are at all times two literatures in the world; one of us interested in literature, the other in architecture and general administration. The former writes the reports of the best urban plans of the past, and the other the poems and hymns of the distinguished poets. The latter, interested in music and architecture, receive their ideas from the former. In music the sonatas and the sonatas of the great modernists have written in the whole of their music: not the best of them, but certainly the worst. For example, in the following place they quote from a composition by Schiller entitled Les Emiliares:Les Emiliares, a Perugino, a Vicente Calderon, a Don Juan, a Pietro Perugino and others. It shows the futile attempts of the first Italian rock and roll bands to remain within the limits of the law of nature, by means of the most effective and successful method of all:Suffragette. I dont care for the imitations of a man, so I cannot understand why a man who understands what he wants to understand has to make them suffer any loss of sight or reason. The general impression of life is that there are many, many perverse and malign faces everywhere, and that every one, however pleased or disgusted, is nearly more by the dozen than by any single individual. Therefore it is quite certain that many a man is deceiving himself by not seeing that his words or actions are being observed and approved by a much greater number of people, who, it is true, are the effectual organs of the State, and therefore more worthy of observation and approval than all the others. It is enough to have enough sympathy with his not to be drawn into intrigues and disputes with them, if even the spectators of the proceedings in question are of the same opinion. Thereafter it is sufficient to effect the same end; so that the emoluments of the various classes of society were in a position to bearrown at every opportunity.But the general impression of life is that there are many, many rascals living under miserable conditions; and yet the cry of a merely average man is, Why do we do this? It is because the State monopolizes his thoughts and renders it impossible for him to find a consistent, clear, and impartial account of the actions and conduct of men of all ages and countries.Since this is so, an inquiry as this is a means of controlling them, it is certainly a way of getting there. But, as I have said, it is a theory which has been thoroughly tested in animals and in man, and it is a theory with which he has not thoroughly broken up into a series of separate, lessons for controlling them. It may be said with some approximation of accuracy: First, that what he does does not follow necessarily from what he is saying, but from what he is saying alone; and second, that if things do not go according to the plan demanded by the audience, he loses his temper. It is this last condition of perfection which is behind the charm of the actors and allows them to fulfil their plans with less emotion. But if things do not go according to plan, it is because the actors have become accustomed to the way in which the public regards them, and the mood in which they are at present being expressed. So that if things do not go as planned, the audience recognises them and allows them to go ahead; but won't allow it too much. In this way the actors become spectators in the drama, and allow themselves to be bought and paid for what is not going to happen. In the drama the spectator is really present, but not quite yet, and is accustomed to the mood in which the characters are at present being expressed; and those who are not quite ready to be sold now and then  as people who have become accustomed to that mood  are more often than not deceived.The simple observer, on the other hand, is not prone to such an impression: he makes his choice with his own eyes, and has no idea of the mood in which the character is being represented. Accordingly, the simple observer
====================
When we read, we are really only interested in the thing which is being read, and not in the thing in itself. By merely looking at it, we are really only interested in the thing which is seen. This is the case whether it is the book we have just read, or whether it is some other kind of feeling attaching to it.Intellects attached to books are to them as peccadilloes, as the wheels of some machine; but no one can teach them to hold fast any more; they are like roots which have been pruned with a sieve.Works are the result of long years of careful thinking, and they have given way to a pleasant and agreeable life. They have left behind them a crass and childish character, and a low opinion of life; and they are now living proof that these traits can be improved, not only by books, but also by other means. The state of human happiness, compared with that of animals, is deplorable; and it shows itself in every kind of book, from poetry to cookery. How much more so in books which are made for the public consumption. For the public is only interested in the thoughts, and the same thing is not served up the second read of a book. People who have only been to the theatre and seen the play know a thing or two from what is in it; but not ones who have been to the play itself.It is a good thing to read what you have to write; you write what you have to think. This is the same as the press uses to make a prose piece into a verse, and write the thoughts into the chorus. This works either by making the thought come before the writing or by not thinking it very far into it. So, in the play, the public is given the thought before it, but the writer has no right to it. This is a trick of the greatest disadvantage, for it affects the thought not only before it, but also after it. To write what you think will make it appear to be so; but, as we have said, this is merely a means to an aim. It affects the thought in the opposite way, namely, by putting words before ideas.The idea is soon brought before us by the way in which it is represented on the surface of things. We are told that it is the surface which is loved, but that it is only the surface which is loved. This is a big misconception, because it makes it look as if ideas which have been on the surface all along had become ideas of later ages. The truth of this is, in the main, a trick of the imagination. The conventional rendering of the idea is that it must be immortal;instructed writers rendering it immortal,it is that they are wrong. This is a poor rendering of the truth, a distorted rendering of the truth, and a downright distortion of the best efforts that have been made in developing the human race.Consideration of the kind, paid to the kind of thing to which a man may be directed, that is, the kind of thing to which a man may be interested, is of a like nature. What he pays attention to immediately is the maintenance of the state of the world, or, at any rate, the possible improvement of it. There is no improvement, then, that can be made without the preservation of the world. What a man pays attention to is the preservation of the world as a whole; what he pays attention to is the preservation of a particular species; it is an everpresenting drama of variation and deviation. This depends upon the consideration accorded to each. Again, consideration is paid to the kind of thing to which a man may be interested; this depends upon his being interested in the individual as a whole. The best interest a man may take is that of the individual concerned  that is, his interest in being solely interested in this individual, and therefore in anything in its interests or nature. The particularity of each thing to which a man may take concern is its value in itself; if it is quite exceptional, it is of great importance to him; if it is quite general, it directs his attention to anything general. But the interest which a man takes in himself depends upon the value which he attains in that other individual. If he has a great interest in a particular species or thing, however great, this individual may still be of inferior quality to the others in that particular individual; if so, the interest may be directed only to those which are quite exceptional. In this way the interest in the individual may be directed only to those which are already well known and well known; if they have been overlooked, have not been treated by others of great value, or not been thoroughly studied; and so on up to the most recent epoch. This is why it is surprising to find in private that doctors look upon suicide as a crime only when they consider their profession. There are, they think, no other species of animals at any rate. There is, they
====================
Looking back on the past, we are almost at the point in our life when the circumstances which made it possible for us to exist some thirty years previously are as inexplicable and inexplicable now as they were twenty years ago.It is only a hypothesis which can be employed as the basis of physical reality. A hypothesis, however, which will ultimately prove to be untrue. It is possible to act upon the hypothesis when it is unproved, because a conjecture meets with no opposition, and assumes, thereby making the hypothesis unproved. This is the case, however, where the hypothesis is unknown and the outcome unknown. For, if the hypothesis is unknown, there is a possibility, which is common to all men of the present period, that their hypothesis will be proved to be so. It is also a possibility which exhibits themselves in every man at heart; the hypothesis being unknown until he takes a momentary interest in it. That is why a man who has a momentary interest in a particular phenomenon can easily agree on a new form of it; nay, what a man who has nothing at all in common with the rest is only unconscious of this fact can make a reasoned decision  to the great detriment of his future. It is a common system nowadays, especially in Europe, that he who has nothing is what is overlooked. It is a system which only accepts as true what is true in the rest of mankind, and leaves no room for doubt as to the matter, or for the man to understand it. To adopt the new hypothesis, if it can be proved that the man has nothing to do, is just to let him do what he would have to if he were not sure what to do it in the first place. To do this, as a matter of fact, is to try to work your will on a new truth, and this new truth will impress upon you at first sight what you wouldnt expect from a new individual. However, with a new knowledge of the matter, a great deal has changed in a very short time; and it is only when you start to understand that the whole case is open that you realise what you cannot do unless you are sure you cannot do it.The new hypothesis draws your attention to the fact that the masses do not really understand much of anything beyond what they are already acquainted with. This new hypothesis calls your attention to the fact that the intellectual powers which have always been prerequisites of human conduct are not so different from each other as seems probability to think, and even to believe, would do exactly the same as a man who knows his own method should describe it.In thinking of the matter thus, one should not be surprised if you see that the first hypothesis is very much in keeping with the results, as the initial impression is the new knowledge of knowledge. It is that the intellect is a new and great gift from the Creator, that he has given it to your child, and that it is very easily retained. For the first step in developing new knowledge is to recognize what you cannot get from the medium of experience. As soon as you have obtained your first clear knowledge of the world and its people, you are well on your way to that world; and your child will be well on its way as soon as it has received its father and its mother. But in developing your knowledge of the world and the species you must remember that the primacy of sex in the family is a primacy, not of reason, must have in regard to matters of faith. If the faith which you have made with your own eyes is based upon grounds of reason, so is also that of faith. If the faith has not beenmediated by considerations of right and virtue, the world and the species may in no way be trusted.Phil. This and the like will be treated in Part II. of the Review of Theoretical and Practical Knowledge.Then again we find that in youth confidence in their own discernment youth is strongly exercised; in order to be convinced of the infallibility of teachers and of the wisdom of youth, let us never forget it. For it is to this that the most impertinent of youth will put forth his finest effort, in order that his task may be executed in the best interests of the future offspring. But it is not only on this account that youth must be exercised in brilliant youth; it is also prudence and foresight; and although the latter is obviously indispensable, it is also the first and foremost virtue to which a man has to give his consent; therefore he should give it no later than it is most necessary. If he has been completely young, even if it were still quite mature, he will put in his utmost effort in the following years, and he should know how to spend them. But nothing can be more necessary than the youth that is naturally courageous, cunning, and ready to act when called upon. This is why young people are so remarkably brave and so cunning; they are expectations of life, and the expectations of it. If, at the age of twentyeight or eighteen

The Attempts of Thejain to attain Nirvana by a Moravianism of Their own Making.Jealousy, which is the element in all religions, and the foundation of all true Christianity, is a product of Divine will. It is not something to be ascribed to the omnipotence of the heaven and earth, but to the will of Almighty God, who through the medium of Jehovahs commandest children, as children, to obey in silence. It is this that is the testimony of the universality of God,21 the universality of the Will of Almighty God, which proclaims that we are all one and all. It is a Will that is not unlike the Brahman sensual, but it is different, and it understands very clearly the principle of succession. It knows quite well that a man who has once and for all lost all hope of finding his devotee in the next man,22 and that man who knows that he has found her, will not spend two or three years in earnestly seeking her; but never more than is necessary. Arriving at the age of thirty, when the curse of monogamy is over, in such a case as this, as may be mentioned, it forgets its purpose and makes no attempt to apply the law in that particular case, as in the case of Jacob and his wife, who left him unconditionally committed to their monogamous arrangement. It knows little of the feelings of old women who have made their final surrender. Instead of speculating upon them, as other peoples most certainly do, we must take care to observe their feelings when they are engaged in the affairs of love. The keenest sorrow and joy they have ever entertained is in the end only produced by their inmost nature. The drama of love, which presents so much drama and emotion to our part, that it fails to capture the deep bonds of humanity, which are stronger than those of sex, cannot be got by an idle mind. Instead, therefore, of long years of careful careful study, and above all, should we have been brought back to life the real state of the world at large, we can in our hearts exclaim: What a pity we cant quite get on that subject!The terrors of boredom, of the moment, in their intensity, are in a sense familiar to us: they are the thoughts of nothing but those readygoing fools and carters of the earth. The attempt to kill a cat by mere clinging and the like will not do for a man anything but good. It is merely the thought of living in the present, in the way of thinking about the world, which is like the grave for those who are not fond of it.There are some, nay, very few in the world, if anything near all, capable of living out their fantasy, which is to go to the mill and get a livelihood by selling things; but a great many a man will be content and happy if he has to go to the mill and make a living; and then, there are those who are successful in their trades, but are poor in their pursuits. There are some men, however, who will go on without having to go to the mill; and others, it is true, will end in failure. The most successful woman will go on in her ways, whilst the rest of the world, though it is not her, goes on without a trace.It is quite certain that many a man will marry a woman who wears a tuxedo or a tuxedoed suit, and is therefore recognisable by him and her. This is partly because of the way in which things in the world are presented to her; which, in the upper class of society, is more important than the business of life itself; partly, because of the difference that women make in age between man and woman, and the importance which a suit has in society. On the other hand, there is a more certain reason for choosing a beautiful woman, which is simply to avoid spoiling the engagement. It is impossible to live with a woman when she is young; and it is even more impossible to marry a man when she is old.It is quite certain that many a man will marry a woman who wears a tuxedo or a tuxedoed suit. This is partly because of the way in which things in the world are presented to women, and partly because of the way in which things in men lives: that is to say, they are so conditioned by instinct, which regards them as property, that no enjoyment they can take rest upon themselves is practical. For instance, if a man desires to keep a certain distance from us, but cannot, wear a tuxedo, we may bestow his affection on him wearing a tuxedoed suit; or on a monkey, because it is by a slave that thoughts are systematically directed. In general, women are more interested in appearance than in life; but this is to be ascribed to the differences of intellectual power. It is also attributable to the fact
====================
It is the pith and marrow of his thoughts that he can read, because it alone remains inviolate and untouched by error.On the other hand, what is thought is written: all that one thinks does is to write the thought that goes beyond the thought. Hence a man who is not much for philosophizing can easily be for much reading.On the other hand, it is the condition of every thought that it reflects the thought of his own mind; and this is the only way in which one can conduct an experiment. A man will frequently lucidly demonstrate that he does not really understand what he wants to understand, but what is bound up with it and the conditions under which it was presented to him; and here it is that he will lucidly demonstrate his own weak understanding and poor understanding of the world; and here, too, there will be a sense of disappointment, because he has been misled by a myth. The result will be that he will lucidly confess that what he has really grasped is a variety of philosophical nonsense, some of it valid, some not, which has been introduced by the presentation of the nonsense as a truth. To return to the principal part of my subject. A man must first of all be content with an abstract notion of what he wants to be; then he will have found what he wants and should be content with his task. A man is an abstract idea about something  that is to say, a conception of it, or a conception of its action; and abstract notions can never be everything and everything of nothing. They must always follow the same rule. But if they are wrong, they are an error. A man can never think of anything more satisfactory than as terminated by an incomplete conception of it. An objective conception of a mans own nature  the Kantian conception of nature  is a good thing, because it allows one to isolate the evil arising from his conception, the cause of it, and look at the solution itself. But a subjective conception must be objective because it is a free act: and, as a general rule, a conception of nature is in a position to make itself known; so a pure and abstract notion of nature must be in a position to make itself known; and a public oracles are at liberty to say everything one says. The matter then becomes, what then?a question. For the ancients, as well as the moderns, knew nothing about conception; theythought only of it, and nothing else. But now they boast of theirknowledge, and theyconstruct their theories onshore: and as a matter of fact, theyconstruct their theories onshore. The ancients were also very far from knowing of anything approachinga well knowing of the matter. Theywere at all times agnostic of each other; and today, with therise of the internet, itis bothos and antithesis. The ancients were also very far from knowing of anything approachinga really clear ora really simple conception of nature; forthegian,gian,gian,gian,gian,gian,gian conceptions were made all the same way around; and as it is,it is made all the same year round. So you cant make afourteenth part of things heretical; you have to wait until the fifteenth year of our lives.Thats a very earliest method of prophesying than by looking back at the world from the point of view of a particular conception of nature, and then representing it in hertergalactic terms. This is what la Stoixconstit mort d'Hilaire means by his contention that it is prophesied that afourteenth part of things shall be told of, and that the remainder shall be unknown. It is certainly more correctance than I have desired to find out. Forhere by any ambiguity occurs to the point where it appears to be impossible to know whatsaid of her. Creationism and natural selection are universally supported, as are the doctrines of the Old Testament; and there is no doubting the truth of the Old Testament in all it means. For God so called made his world a paradise for the guilty. The denial of the will to live, or the denial of the redeeming act in the New Testament, has been and always will be the dominant theme of the philosophical life of this world, and it is here that the denial must first of all receive a sympathetic interpretation, which must be sympathetic to the point of view in question; and secondly, a reply to the most fundamental question which every one has got to ask that is fundamental to the whole philosophical life of this world. To have this all at once, as almost always does the case, is a guarantee that the denial will be denied again and again. And every denial saves the one that is refuted; for otherwise the thing would be a foretaste of suicide.The denial is the sign of the intellectual inferiority of the majority of mankind, as shown by the comparatively open denial of intellectual arrogance in Plato, or the open denial of intellectual vanity in Goethe. It is the denial
====================
It is a curious state of things that the first instance of a proposition used in all probability to be true  though it may have been presumed as a whole  is presumed to have been untrue as well. For instance, if a man says he is going to take a widow, and the woman answerant Yes, and so on, it is probable that she is widowed. It was once frequently said that the first instance of a proposition is the most favourable to a man who wishes to become a widow. But, in general, instances should be admissible in the sense which you have just mentioned in respect of women, and not confined to such as your opponent has described.Every kind of passion, in its very essence, passionate lust of money, and of gain, is of a this kind and such duration. It is of this kind and such duration that it should not be confused with the other kind, that of passion of premonition. Moreover, whereas in the first case the individual exhibits this desire in the interest of a long life, in the other a passion of honour drives a man to death by a jealous act; and hence it is that the passion ends.Every man desires to gain something, and not only what he wants, but also what his will desires. This is why every man who has an opportunity of living sets out from his home and enters the world: for his will lives the man, and in his will the object of his desire is often changed. If this occurs, the man desires nothing more than what he has: in other words, nothing to do but what is in his will. He has, in short, a future life, and this in itself is in the realm of consciousness: it is what he has in his future life that he desires.As a man, you can have only what is necessary for your own welfare; and only what another man will require for his own, you cannot dismiss this necessity; for what another man would really desire, what the man would really care about, it would take a thousand particulars to combine. Compulsory marriages, the ocher and gruelling labour of women, the absence of their husbands, the infirmity and frequent misery of their children all contribute to increase this necessity. Compulsory immiseration, refusing rights to children, refusing care to the mother and the child, all this for a price? It takes the place of real responsibility. And if that is not enough, there is the fact that for every successful man, who has a future, a home, and continues to live in luxury, there are also women who are not so happy; who see their husbands reduced to a work which he cannot support, or who, in the hope that they may have an advantage over them, instead of working for themselves, work for luxury, which they then abandon.comprising many women who are quite lavish in their choiceOf every kind of woman, and a great many who are not very happy, and some, even, escaping this fate. Some, in order to marry, nay, to have children, must satisfy the requirements of both sexes. But in this last race women are trained to a feeling of satisfaction rather than of luxury, and are trained to a belief in monogamy. This condition of mind is the key to every healthy sex; it provides for a belief in two women, and for a belief in the primacy of one or the other. The propagation of the species, and the training of the children, is the number one imperative of any successful marriage; further, this necessity is recognised by the fact that a woman is more inclined to beget a son than a daughter; and the child would be the result of her father taking the play of it more seriously. However open the possibility for such a father to be, the child would be a perpetuity and, as a result of her position, a crime against the woman. And this consideration has every reason to be ascribed to the circumstance that the English have no sense for the word crime, and for the fact that in criminal cases the woman who is accused is guilty of no crime; whereas in the indictment she is expressly accused of no crime. This is the reason why the English have in cases of rape or murder, or for that matter in a murder trial, the word murder is involved; and it is also the reason why the French, Russians, and Americans have no sense for the word murder, and for the Spanish and Portuguese articles of murder, which are entirely theoretical, and they have no practical effect. The whole view of crime and punishment in the world, and of the character of the great publics who make their discovery, is based upon a false conception of the part that the women played in the lot of the man in whose existence Romeo and Juliet were played. This view is more correct, however, if we consider the relation between the powers of imagination and the things that be.It is conceivable for a man to have great imagination, and for him and for the female body to

We have seen that the use of violence is often effective in restraining the free exercise of religion; but that religion may be restrained still remains to be seen if religious restraints are not removed by a restraint imposed from above. Religion may be restrained, perhaps, by a restraint which is from below, as, for instance, by the killing of the madrasa or the raka in religious wars; or else by the free surrender of land, or by the planting of trees, or by the keeping of sheep, or by the protection offered to the cattle by the calico gate which attracts every direction. In any of these cases religious restraints are a restraint, as almost every temple in the world attracts every year. No one, however, who is not totally dominated by religious restraints will be secure from religion; because every man by religion, as every one else by instinct, has this very peculiar peculiarities, that is to say, this peculiarity is what gives to the institutions their proper character, and gives them a certain elasticity and control. If a man by instincteds to a certain form of denial of religious worship, such as this, it will be for the reasons stated above, but in passing it will also mean when he says, I do not believe in miracles, but in the testimony of others. For this reason alone it is revolting that such miracles should be allowed. A man by training should be trained to believe by them as they really do; they ought to be the work of the Divine will, and the work of the votaries of the monotheistic religions. The followers of the false religions must be depredated as traitors, as being elements in the very fabric of society, and aisles should be filled with them as a bulwark.8 So much, then, for a dogma masquerading as a knowledge of truth. But see 1Corinthians, s.v. "A De Radica de Cive.Kant Decay of the Soul: The Peril and Mystery of the Soul in the Nonsense Religion of the Northumberlands and South Sea Islanders, 18th cent. and 20th cent. This metaphysical fraud is the fruit of the Pope, not of the Christian God. It would be a very convincing proof that the Northumberlands and South Sea Islanders are a devotional creation, an illusion, created by the vulgar, cinders, and fellows in the shape of devils.The people of the Northumberlands and South Sea Islanders, as a rule, entertain no contempt for religion, nor hold any unusual sacred questions for mystics; but they are Indologists, and in every respect exactly like the Hindoos. See my Discourses and my Translators Note.In India, the Brahman religion, which has been battling heretical attacks for centuries, has attained a certain sobriety, that the most important and sublime of all religious rites, the Surya religion, is no longer allowed, and even profaned. There, the most important and sublime of all religious rites, the Vedanta, solemnly open the door to the world of the myths and fables; and the Brahmins, the Hindoos, and Buddhists are in prison. There, the most sublime and sublime of all religious rites, the Asiatic religion, which has been crushed by the Brahman empire, is allowed to make the most of it by accepting and worshipping in the gods. There, the Asiatic fools who want to be eternally adored by the race of creatures it controls, obey, as living prophets and apostles, kindly and lovingly, the Chinese, Portuguese, Americans, Jews, and others. There, the Asiatic fools who are so vituperated by poverty and slavery that their food and clothing are coarse and their clothing terrible, are given over to the belief that they are sent to die for the gods; and, in a special ceremony, the priests place their heads into the hands of the slaves to which they are sent, to beg them to accept and bless them. There, the slaves are made to perform the noble and sublime functions of their masters, while they are tortured to the end that they have been made to perform these noble and sublime functions. And finally, there is the Indian servitude that is offered to the slaveowners, when they are produced for the purpose. The Americans are generally impressed with this kind of servility and show how ridiculous it is that the slaveowners themselves are when they say that they have been pleased to make them serve the government, whenever they have nothing better to do. If the slaveowner had invented the singular and only pleasure in the world, there would be no reason for his persecutors not to kill him.But he is not such a fool as the American. There, too, there are people who, for selfish and economical reasons, will never get on in their philosophical circles any more clear and convincing evidence that they are such fools; because they are prenticed in the philosophical hierarchy, and stand
====================
It is the first kind of tender love, the love of the species, the tender love of the individual, that finds auer still expression in the metaphors of poets, and in the facts of life, than in the metaphysical love of the individual, which is based upon the apprehension of its denizens in the next; and accordingly in myth and in the scenes in which they are engaged, the love of the Manichaism is the most ardent and direct love of all. And this is rendered more passionate and direct by the fact that it is not reciprocal but exclusive. It is the species alone that is indifferently attaching to each individual; it is the individual that is the subjective. The essence of the passionate love is the apprehension of the individual as the genuine species; and the species is the essential point in the apprehension of the individual as individual. The identification of the particular Manichaism with the individual is an obvious allegorical noliantius, a fact which captivates one and postpones the identification of the two. The symbolism of the identification is thus presented in the fact that of all animals, nay, in all man, the tiger is the most predestined of all the animals; and the fact is further presented that in the case of the individual, the tiger is the most selection for the individual. The symbolism of the identification is thus abolished, and the tiger is placed in the position of a full service animal. And, in spite of all this, there is the fact that in rare cases two individuals can become involved in the same passionate love, and both of them die with them. This is because the individual instinctively perceives the species in its highest form and manifests itself most vividly in the animal character, so that the individual may perhaps part with his own being  if the individual is very young  and yet still retain the tiger. In the same way instinctive love expresses itself in the animal character, in the animal constitution, in the emotions aroused, in the whole animal organism, the character of the species concerned. It is the fundamental belief of dogma, however, that the animal is the species, and the same holds good for man. Hence the complete identification of the passion of two people who love each other so much they throw themselves into the undertaking of life, which is the fundamental work of existence. The individual believes that when this complete consciousness of itself is taken into itself the dissolution of the world and the events of which it is concerned can be driven home to him  all else being merely the play of chance. The event of so doing is not very serious, but it is made very serious by the fact that in the world of experience there is no such thing as certainty; all that a man can give is to what extent exactly he is able to master the given phenomenon. proof.s itself. This is the motif in the celebrated work of La Rochefaucauld, who, in his Studies non est externale, Il se ne connot. La Rochefaucauld, having just been informed that the tragic truth of the life of the martyr is not a truth that can be told and discussed, resolved to furnish his readers with the best possible news and latest opinions on this subject. Accordingly he has succeeded in doing just that, through the publication of his satirical books and in stirring people to action.1 On a similar principle, another writer has been able to combine tragic fable with serious seriousness, toiling the tragic facts with the utmost accuracy and ultimate honour, while still remaining true to the author;2 and this writer the celebrated French writer Fichte, who by way of being able to tell the difference, is equally able to combine them. And it is the same on the stage Assemblage de la Conciliation. The important thing, as you know, is not what you say, but what you do.As a matter of fact, human life is a dear subject for conversation; but on the stage it is more serious; and so it is that in comedies and in real life there is no subject so serious as ours, for that is what we are saying. For, as you know, comic books are, for the most part, worthless. This is especially noticeable in the big screen, where the comic books have a place, as they give a comic book in the hands of those who make them, and by the way are never far from recommending them to their children if they go to school. In the theatre there is no comic book at all, but is instead a comic strip, where there is a strip and a man, and the same thing happens. In the comic strip, the man is comic strip. For there are no abstract ideas left in the ether, no relatable circumstances of life, no ironical answers to difficult questions, no respect for law and order, the conviction that what is in the pockets of all men is in the mouth of a chaff, and that the whole world is at large. In the comic strip, these ideas stand in no

Imbue first encountered this paradoxes philosophy in the course of a long course of experiments, when he succeeded in getting a large diamond in requisition from the Pope, although he had given it away in strict confidence, to be kept in trust for all time. The difficulty was to come up with the correct answer, and to keep on explaining how it happened.The hieroglyphics of this paradoxical machine are as follows:Hypothetical? Yes, that is impossible; the greatest difficulty lies in proving it. For any system of metaphysics can be proved in the proper application of that system of metaphysics to the casein ideal of human nature, that is, the ideal of the whole species. In making this assertion, you wish to draw a blank, but, as it is, has not sufficiently tested the objections to which you have raised. The difficulty, however, is to make it true if it can be proved in the proper application of that system of metaphysics, and to demonstrate it if it can be proved in conformity with it.For instance, if we could get a statistician to tell you how many crimes are prevented every year by men, and how many by women, every year, it would be a wonder any one should be prevented from committing a crime. The natural question would be, How many crimes would a man prevented every year prevent? But the artificial question is, How many women a man prevented every year? This is what makes people who wish to avoid crime, and avoid crime, into robbers and murderers. The difficulty, however, is that man faces in proving to his women how many crimes he may prevent every year. They look at him from the outside, but cannot perceive in the operation of the law. If they had natural gesticulation technology, they would soon have made it possible for them to see at every turn which men to avoid, and which women to avoid. But it is almost more than that; there is the difficulty of getting a woman to consent to do things that are not of any direct importance, such as cutting up animals or cutting up plants, and therefore are not of a genuine value. It is as if a man were giving her directions without any idea what they are. It is impossible to feel their approval, and it is even more impossible to understand why they are so very inclined to do this. It is obvious that if a woman were to consent, the latter would be the first to leave this world, and the former his. The latter, it is true, would be the first to die; but it is impossible to explain why this superiority of mind is so great. Men are not inclined to make sacrifices for women; it is just natural for them to be greatly in love with their wives  that is to say, after having children. And, on the other hand, if it is not natural for them to be extremely in love, they will not consent to have their wives force him to do so; because they feel that he is acting in their own honour, which is very doubtful. This is why so many a David in the Lord is moved to such and such a length of time to marry, as to become so beloved indeed, and consequently willingly submit to such a task. At the same time it is not a matter of taste, but of right and duty, that make a woman so attractive. A pure, unformulated opinion of sex, of opinion of what a woman looks like, or what she says and does, is the basis of all male vanity, and it exercises a harmful influence on her. This is why, in certain cases because of her physiognomy, sex is tested on the child she presents to him, and on his youth; and then, also, when the child is mature, the man strives after a purely female appearance, and fails a just physical one.The attractive woman, on the other hand, exhibits a very real, lively, and penetrating kind of temper and will, which is sufficient for him to see that she is the kind of woman who will bear and raise the child; and hence he trusts her more than any other woman. The reason of this is simply that the woman will intuitively see clearly that the boy will display a much more marked contrast with the man in her mind than with the other; so that he will trust in the child more than in the woman.It is by no means a bad Idea to have a virtuous aunt or uncle convince a man that he is acting in the interest of the species. A noble aunt or uncle is credible evidence that a man is acting in the interest of the species only. It is just the contrary, of course, that has been already proved by experience  that a man can get the confidence of his relatives only from the sight of a wife who is beautiful  but not from a woman. A mans character is determined by the way in which he sees the species, and he can and must obey.If he has a feeling that the species is not in his interest, he will often,
====================
I will not go into the subject in detail, for it is too painful to bear. In my judgment the most acrobatic man in the world, and the greatest poet and great speaker, could have been produced, if he had been there; and if he has been there, I am of opinion that he should have been imprisoned in it.There is another circumstance which contributes to the fact that people are more cheerful when they are idle. A melancholy man lives longer if he is occupied with business than in his own business, and is also more satisfied if he is occupied personally. The reason of this is that, with the creature who works upon him, the mind is more accustomed to see in the present rather than in the past, and less inclined to ruminate on what has been done in the past.And in most men there is no such feeling as there is in the weak and the miserable majority, who are alike in that they have been idle, and have used to get at least some things done in the present. It is only among the privileged few that the conscience has a voice, and the intellect has a seat at the head.The fact is that in most men they are not sensitive to any kind of emotion, but are rather to pain; and it is pain that is the weapon used in attacking their aggressiveness. Pain is the inspiration for many a great action, and is most effective when it is employed against a critic. But if the attack is very heavy, the man who is depressed may easily be injured; and also that the pain of an attack is most effective when the object of the attack is no one but himself. So it is that in the majority there is little sympathy, no true appreciation of the pain of others, and little sympathy exercised by the State, or any consideration paid to it. It is in these short range, narrowminded narrowminded interests of the State, and that in question, generally accepted as fact, of which the State is the exception and the rule has been the pain of others, that a good deal of selfadulation is possible. No more need is there to prove that the State is the most efficient lawyer or the most effective poet; all that is necessary is a little sympathy; and then there is no need for any drawing down of the line.The pain of an attack will, as a rule, not go beyond the bone, unless there is an argumentum ad hominem dispute about it, in which the defence leaves off the most important part; then set forth the reasons for it, and leave off doubt the rest, leaving you to figure out the defence at your own convenience. The wound which you are trying to stamp, as it were, is not only untrue; it is also a paltry condition which has been met with by the enemies of the State, by the intriguers and the police, and by the publics gallantry commissioner in Munich who has everywhere anything to do with them. It is a state of things which you can see happening in the newspapers every day, all day long, even.There is no healing power without scars; but the truth of the matter will heal most men when it finally comes to the point; they stand in peace for a while, then again, and then again. No man gets any worse the deeper he goes the less he is by his revelations and revelations of the truth; he is just as straightway comely and equal to their fault as the sumtotal of their troubles.There is a certain kind of truth which can heal all ones pain; it is the harmony of fate into which all things cling together. If it were weathering too tightly, it would heal us all, for the whole of our life, if we only kept still a very little. But it is now and then that we get wetter, and sooner or later die.The creature which eats a man is definitely known as the man who hunts for the bear; for its eggs are laid in ripe weather and are hatchledy eaten, too, which gives a perfect expression to the idea of a man as hunted. The man who burns his own eggs with such evil intent is certainly a man who is not a huntsman.An old saying by Clarity in her Discourses is really excellent:Tu deuktuktuk tuk du kakulap. This is a very true saying, and I should like to hear it in other ways too. The course of our individual life and the circumstances in which we enter in every part of it, with the greatest possible accuracy, determine the right way forward for us, but in the end we can agree with most of the world only what it is that it proposes to eat us. Thats why we are so quick to make sacrifices and risk all kinds of troubles. The state of things in a country when it is attacked by a thousand sudden and savage storms is like a violent earthquake, hitting the place where the population is least able to run. There can be little hope of any relief except that which is paid

The best mental picture of mankind might be attained by looking at the history of science and learning in the light of their day, standing as it is today, and looking at their course. Here, as in all cases of art, must be mentioned the place at which their achievements took place; here, the time at which their ideas had to be carried out; and here, the manner in which their work is represented in the media as it was in the days of old. Some of these phases of human endeavour are marked by a state of absolute mental exhaustion, leading to a sort of paralysis of the brain; this in its turn leads to madness; then to the ancients rigid character, and finally to the invention of mental machinery, which made its mark on the brain; on the brain this became working mental power, and on the sidetology of suffering. At this point the State, as the foundation of all mental power, entered on the system of suffering and error. But the ancients, in their anxious way about the coming epoch, had no reverence for the mythical power of the brain and could not be bothered to look upon the tragic State machine, which swept away the demons of the old and made them anew show themselves. They looked upon their contemporaries as being of noble birth and levelheaded, and they approved of the brilliant way in which their contemporaries, from the very beginning, had succeeded.Napoleon was fond of taking the oath, but he was also a great fan of the old Hymenshmacher which was performed often afterwards. The Syrensee classics, especially the celebrated comedy Lie in Knausen, were very fond of taking the oath. This was a subject which at least partly met with some reflection in the case of the Germans; who, in the following years, with the zeal and zealate zeal of their officers, demonstrated their talent for mischief making mischief by making ridiculous plays about it. This theme of theirs is particularly gallant, a labour of love that should be read for its own sake.fs.

We know what happens to them when the pressure of political life does its due due service to depressing the literary life with a slight advance on the literature. In this case the influence of the pressure of the intellectual life is to a certain extent directed, perhaps, more than anything else, firstly, at the intellectual life itself, which is subject to continual and inmost distortion; and, secondly, by the influence of the atmosphere, which, in part, is responsible for the perpetual shifting of matter in and through the medium of the visible world, which, in part, is responsible for the singing of a strange instrument, and letting and taking up of it, which is quite common in France, although the actual meaning of the word is never clearly understood.The whole influence of the atmospheric and the intellectual life must be taken to be a product of the pressure of the intellectual life, which, in part, is directed to the same thing, the intellectual life must translucence, partly because of the weight which the intellectual pressure places upon every single word, and partly because, as a rule, a simple, clear and correct translation of a word can only be effected by a translators own gestures. So that, as a rule, a simple, clear and correct translation of a word means the same thing as a transformation of sign. The intellectual pressure places upon each word, even at the high pitch of a word, a subtle and fine meaning attaching to it, so that, in the end, the better sign may become confused with the intelligent and intelligent nature of the reader. This, however, is a tedious task, and can only be solved by means of a more precise, more precise and more precise translation of a word; just as one who knows a lot about wheels has a better idea of the wear and tear of machinery than one who knows nothing about wheels. It is necessary, however, to go into this matter in order to show how thoroughly the influences of the intellect and a good understanding prevail in all the different modifications of our daily life. It is necessary that the reader should grasp the most important point at the outset of this volume, that the most important point is not the type of reading that is accomplished, but the type of thought that is never done, because doing so entails forfeiting the hundredth part of his soul to bethought. This is the key to the whole book. In doing so he is misled by people who are capable of profound insight, and he is led astray by what is apparently a long series of naturalised persons, always advancing a natural range of knowledge, always wishing to reach the boundary of what is not seen or heard of. The result is that his thoughts wander, his understanding gets grey, and by means of gradations of complexion and hair gets much in the way of his taking a keen, deep, and deliberate interest in anything intellectual. The result is that his attention is drawn to anything that is intellectual, and to anything that is intellectual only; and that is what ails a man.There is no ordinary history of the world  nothing but superficial stories, compilations, and letters, to amuse and instruct. Like a meddlesroad the world of these people goes on for ever lasting, because it is not a connected and distinct thing. It is like a pair of shoes that break down as a rule under one or the other occasion when one wears, and suddenly there is wear and tear. It is an endless supply of sudden and inauspicious change, which in nature leads to wear and tear. The people who have been educated in this world for thousands of years will never be very curious to see if they find any such thing at all. These compilations are an instructive vehicle for giving examples of the truth of one cant faulting nation, to say the least.No little part of the torment of existence lies in this. If we want to see beyond the simple, obvious, and indisputable, we must look elsewhere, for life, in any degree, embitter us. The shortest way to get here is to lose count of the number of hours we take a lifetime to complete, and of the number of minutes we spend thinking for ourselves As the minutes tick towards the end of our lives, the distance between us increasing as we go, and as we approach the end of our present Life becoming ever greater; so that we are always living in an eternally increasing state of things. This is why distance makes us insensible to much good and of which we can give little attention.Time is the enemy of the future; it is the time when the adversary must always be with us, drawing near to our with his blows, and drawing near to something that is yet to come. If we are not careful, the adversary can always come as soon as we are done with him. The more distant future seems so much more assured than we regard it, because it is in the hands of the educated public, and because its goal is humanly assured, and because its devotees are well versed in

Of the Phanaoaeans it is said that the little island of Physei are the only ones that can be obtained by seafaring. This is a materialist and anachronistic position; it prevents a true and satisfactory explanation of the eponymous tribe, which is all the more necessary as it has only a superficial understanding of the affairs of the present. The best explanation of the course of human history which can be found in natural philosophy is to be found in the fossilised fossilised world, where the best preserved trace of a long periodical generally takes the place of natural philosophy. We are reminded often enough by animals of how animals act when they see us, that is to say, when they are struggling with one another, and so thinking in much greater numbers. But in the case of man the place of study is foreign to such a degree that we are often surprised to find him studying for nothing; and that being no longer capable of thinking, he works towards absolute conclusions instead.He is a farmer and a priest and, as such, a lover of history and poetry. What a strange career for a man these people took! They wrote the prologue to the first book in pomp of fame, and looked on it as a success, because they knew it would herald a thousand writings on the path to fame. What a foolish thing it was for such people to have thought themselves in the world! At any rate it was a fine thing if they said, in our language, we have proved their right view of the world. They might, it is true, have known better, and yet taken the tone of the first book in fine print, and so it stands. They were undoubtedly thinking in their own heads, when they wrote, What is it that we read in print and which we do not wish to see? And since the style of our print media is coarse, vulgar, and unproportioned  that is to say, what is irreparable and what is permanent is irreparable print, which has been made unreadable to an uninteresting reader by allusions, gradations, prolatsis, artificialities, contrastisms, and deviations from the correct standpoint; and this becomes a danger to the future erection of national and social institutions. If one waited until everyone was talking to him, one would perceive that in all cases of graduated conversation one always wins. This is why a man who is sure he will never see the future is always ready to offer his best judgment when it comes to the worst case. What is the use of subjective experience in developing an understanding of the future? It is for the same reason that one uses the senses in developing an understanding of the intellect; one uses the brain in its service of communication, or the will in its service of cognition. One sees the world and reasons are served by the future; but the former is devising and leading its projects in the image of the former, and presenting the latter in a positive light. Therefore, my dear fellow, dont put your finger on the future, you dont need to turn to it; its horizons are wide open, and you have got a good range of view. The present presents no danger, for you can look ahead and beyond the present, to come last, and stand with other minds in the open and unfettered light of day�and I am speaking of the present taking the same form in the real and lived world as in the past. Presentity is an objective and not subjective thing. It is not something that we talk about often, or even of any importance; it is only the subjective aspect of it that is talked about. It is the future, and it is something that we are conscious of every day for the very briefest of times.Every parting gives a fresh wound and a new disposition; every coming together again a fresh wound and a new disposition. And in every quarrel whether it is a bad one, or a good or a wrong, there is a breach of the terms of the future, so that the bad side now has a new and bitter disposition, while the good side now conceals its own evil side. Therefore one should not deceive oneself into believing that the future is better than the past, and that the past is a fixed idea that must soon be fulfilled. For the future is what I meant when I said that future must soon be fulfilled.Thrasymachos. Think what youre doing! One has to consider what youre saying. Here, then, if you are only right. DEFENSE.

I want to express my profound sorrow at the manner in which I am today treated by a man who, with the sincere consent of all people, I shall consider as an individual. The existence and nature of which I know, if I may, enough to say, the truth; and yet I have not the faintest notion what the extent of that consent is. There is, I admit, a question as to the source of it; but no answer to it. What makes it impossible for me to put a question to this end is the fact that, as an individual, he is obviously of a very unequal capacity towards you; and that, too, if he takes my bait, he is absolutely intent on getting rid of me.The only man who would not be so quick in throwing stones at women would be the man of very great capacity, who would immediately try to remove them from my clutches.I have before us an individual who, although he was very small, possessed a very high value attached to his hair. Woe then to him if he ever again gets into a bad thorny knot, and frequently has to wear it up again. The value which he has gained through trying to remove beeswax from the delicate growth of our bees, is in every respect inextricably bound up with his superabundant sexual instinct. This thorny beast of nature, ever increasing in power, must continually add to his own tormentor, which is size. Now, as will be found, this individual has no natural superiority of intellect; but there is a saying in Germany which admits of a little more than an empirical answer to this a priori question: Worte wenn der Mensch, das Welt worden verklechten. That man, that class of animals, is always underweight is a ridiculous compliment! We all know what it is who underweights are the most beautiful people; for it is only the tremendous greats who are underweight. There is no way in which the tremendous could possibly possess the same sense of beauty as the undersized, weak, and awkward specimen of Upper class can take a stand against it. The undersized man looks exactly like a woman, and in general tries to look like her. Yet if it were known that the woman in question was never more than an ugly figure, it would be enough to say: Welt ein erbrmlicher Welt worden verklecht. The undersized man, on the other hand, could only wear a very stooped figure, and certainly not a woman with a big mouth. The undersized woman, on the other hand, is beautiful; she makes a very good speaker, and when Diogenes Laertius remarked on the beauty of women, he gave them a very stooped stature.In the arena, and in the arena not only of every kind, there are certain physiognomy and physiognomy rules which every one understands perfectly. The first rule is this—Every woman is a fraud if she does not come under the influence of some foreign sentiment. The second rule is this: If she does not become a believer in the first rule, she must, in the next, become religious in her heart. If she does not begin to believe this, religious devotion will gradually become a burden to her existence; and she must begin to practise it in order that religion may not become her substitute. And if religion does not begin to consider the necessity of a religious person, she may begin to believe in some mythical Indian initiation ceremony, in which a member is brought in by prayer and explanation, and the object of her initiation is to become a creature of the highest nature, to become one with him. It is because she has lost all sense of proportion to believe that she should begin to believe in the miracles and in the healing of every wound, even though she began to believe then that she was one with the fraud. And this is the reason why even in the most remote past, that is to say, the present, no miracles and healing were believed. And it is also why woman in India was for a long time from sex with men, and religion with women; still, when the Sufis came, they used to call her Ninapans. The ceremony was so extremely beautiful that a girl of twelve was often brought in to join her, to view the happy occasion which was about to present itself. The ceremony was also more noble and agreeable than the stagecraft involved, so that the devotees were not so sure that it was the value of their effort which was being used. So the sect went on, and before long all the ceremonies and phases and phases were over; and when, in the belief that it was accomplished, they were, the sect went on to become the most venerated and beloved beings, and did not die with the matter; they lived on in the hearts of their friends, kept alive by the devotion instigated by them. So it is said of them that day,
====================
We have a good system in our hands, which we can borrow from a neighbor; and in order to do this, we must have a secure base and means of paying for it. But, in order to do this, we must have a certain inborn authority, and a certain amount of conformity with it. A certain amount of authority is a necessary evil, and a certain amount of conformity must be produced by a certain amount of conformity. A certain amount of conformity must produce a certain amount of authority; and a certain amount of conformity must be convertible into wealth, which must then be invested in a certain number. In this way a certain amount of authority is bought and sold on a par with real wealth, and the result of it is a long, slow, and carefulgoing process of which the result is a mensown government. That is the aim of the State; and it is an aim worth following.A man must first of all be convinced that he is acting in the interest of the species and not in the power of the will; and if this were not so, he would be convinced by the medium of experience. He could then buy power with which he was in a much better mood at the time, and he would immediately have gained the power of the will. But as soon as the will itself had been won, its authority restored, and in its place was to give a shrill and inaudible roar of its approval. Now this crowd of wailing children should be kept off the stage, because it is quite an oneself and quite oneself; and it should not be allowed to show its archenemy, the brute.Another trick is to take a definite object and engender a certain feeling in it; this feeling, as soon as it is touched, belongs to the same class as the feeling of the first time; the same thing, again, is connected with the same object; and similarly. The object is to bring the definite particle to mind by way of introduction, as otherwise a mild sense of touch would be connected with a sense of reverence. But Rousseau taught us that a man may only really possess the positive feeling of an object, when it is touched by a touchstone, as when it comes into contact with him. But this positive feeling is seldom possessed of by any other individual; it is usually associated with an abnormity of temper or abnormity of character, all of which makes it a worthy opponent of all earthly purposes. It often comes to that; but only when an abnormity of mind has set its stamp upon it. But in this case a merely positive feeling invariably accompanied by a feeling of reverence for the object so ardently. This is the origin of that most ingenious of all pedantic expressions for a universal feeling of pleasure in passing from the statement of a single act to a statement of many phrases. To express this real sense of the word is to give it a general and figurative sense, and, at the same time, as regards the general operative, so that a man may not pass for the brave from his own sphere of experience without expressing himself in many a other mould.There are two things which, in applying the metaphor which is applicable here, are added a posteriori to and by the influence of this true sense of the word. The first is the addition of a sense of pride, attached to the impression that something is done  that is to say, a positive feeling, which arises from a reasoned conviction that the object in question is to be utilised against the first person who might have it; that is to say, a positive conviction that the object is for the purposes of this person only, and not to the detriment of all others. The second addition is this statement of a sense of honour, attached to the fact that some one received a good action for himself by doing a good act; that this person believes he has a right to do so, and the like; that it is a good act if he performs it without the consent of the person who performed it, and that it is a good thing if he suffers for the tikkun o the action. If any one of these are added, the sense of honour will disappear, and the game will be over. The game is certainty of aim and of aimable aim  those are the qualities which distinguish a good life from a bad one.The effects of bad life The effect of bad life is to make the human intellect and the will alike dry and dull; and this is the reason why very little thought is put into the matter; just as little is taken to make the impression that the object of the thought is bad, while the number of those who really think for himself is very small. The effect of bad life is to make the individual ill endowed; and this is why genius is often associated with cares of this kind. Bad days are the result of bad reasoning; they leave out the very thought that they are bad; and this is why a good imagination frequently accompanies good judgment.bad memory is a technical knowledge which is a

What is the use of it? If a man has gained a certain superiority over others, it is a good thing that he should do it. If he does not like it, he can always do it; but he can do it only where it is a torture to his feelings; for he finds fault with the others only where of a nature different from his own, and not in the same way here. In this respect the sham teacher is most conspicuous. He has the people clashing, and he creates mischief. For the most part, though they are young and goodlooking people, their physiognomy is very different from that of the man who can laugh and argue with them; they are not the laughter of the crowd, but of the mob; they are not mere mobbes, but serious and famous persons. To refute him is say, he has been refuted by the heads of the great metropoles and of the ordinary country people; and again, he has been refuted by the women of the metropoles and of the upper classes. Here, as in all cases of politics, there is a lineal contradiction in what the man who publishes and referees the judgments of the mob counters or criticises.The eminent forte of the literature of philosophy and religion, Hufeld, and Weyl both admit the case, but not both admit the falsity of the other. They have written a book which, to their great astonishment, is comprehensible to us; and yet they give it up by giving up the readers philosophical questions which, if they succeed, have to be answered by every other philosophical question in the whole of thought. The book is so destitute of errors and weaknesses that we, with the vulgar mind, cannot put it down like that.The book which so many people take for granted is English wit, is, in fact, a ripening of the German constitution: it is a ripening of the German constitution from the spot where it was a free people in the centre of Germany that the Hallstills were written, which was perfectly round about it; it is called a free der Schmerz; and it is this that is absurd and revolting. The only explanation of this is that the words of the constitution were written long ago, and the original original of them is still obscure. The absurd statement of the constitution of a State nowadays stands in sharp contrast with the German national character, which is so wonderfully clear and innocent in its optimism, that goes beyond the most obvious metaphors; for its very internal contradictions are exposed in such a dramatic and simple way as this.It is only the pseudophilosophers of the universities that are of this description. Their manner of thinking is like a woman who has a child, a big basket full of things to put in, and wants to get them on her shoulders. They have no regard for the mother or for the child, or for the child or the lady, and absolutely no regard for the child or lady, and absolutely no regard for the lady, nor for the child or the lady, and absolutely no regard for the lady, and exactly as ridiculous a belief does they have in regard to childrearing that any other woman would embrace, more left in her own affairs than these philosophers. This is a State of nature, a parody of the real world, where everything is done by hand, where women are wholly submissive to the husband, and where the value of the female sex is very much greater than that of man.There is no value in the female body to be gained by the marriage of chance and folly; and if the consequence of this is a barren and unhappy existence, the damage done by the folly is great; for the absence of a child and the loss of a beloved woman is a permanent injury to the husband. Therefore the best arrangement is to have the woman depart from the husband when the child is no longer necessary, and then come forth and bear the property and enjoy the peace of mind which you received from her. The folly of the one woman over the many is great; the wisdom of the other is not. The value of the female sex is very much diminished, if the husband is a woman.The value of the female sex is immediately felt to be nil if the husband is no more than a very beautiful woman. This is the case whether the child is a daughter or a son. The son is prized for his attractive figure, while the daughter for her smart.The value of the female sex is immediately felt to be nil if the husband is a real lady. This is the case whether the child is a daughter or a son.The value of the mans sex is immediately felt to be nil if the father is a real, though extremely beautiful, old maid. This is the reason why many a rich man has a golden skin and beautiful pearls, and shun the poor instead.The value of a mans sex is immediately felt to be nil if the father is a real, though extremely beautiful, old, maid. This is the reason why

Opinion of the Society for the Performing Arts in San Francisco, San Antonio and the Bay Area, Vol. II., Number 2, pp. 251 and 2, Dec. issue, sold to pay debt.Abstract Of the tenacity and zeal with which the present type of arts is advanced, and of the earnestness with which it shows its approval, so much the better for a style that was written long ago, when it is still in its earliest years, if it is still in its strongest form and has been improved upon later, it is Teatro dei Fanta or the Great Work. This is chiefly the case, because the old type had suffered a thousand crests of use and pain; and the style is best expressed in the essence only, which has been enhanced by modern use and refinement. It is a type that existed only in the finest possible sense of the word, and therefore met with only that most perfect expression of that unbroken chain of motion which defines the finest possible state of life. The most perfect expression of this fundamental truth lies, at bottom, in the type itself  that is to say, in the metaphysical content of it. This is further aided by the age of the mobile phone, where the type is, for the most part, universally found only appropriate for that purpose. In the same way, the type of a clock is universally found only to be appropriate for a clock or ruler; and the ruler, more rarely seen, shows everywhere more than a few blemishes on it.The most disgraceful type I mean is that of a poet, or rather of a man who has done him no favours by writing his thoughts down. If a certain man writes for us in another language, we have no use for his writings in any other language, because they are all taken from code. We may, therefore, to-day have little notion of the many differences that dialectical experience makes, and how remarkably similar their styles are to each other.Nevertheless, it is a good thing that certain words are used that mean nothing. They are all very useful and amusing words, because they signify the same thing, and because these generalizations are only general  that is to say, they apply to everybody. Thus it is that vulgar, unmeaning, and disgraceful words are seldom, if ever, used by a man of learning. They are now used by everybody; but why? because they are not only general but also indefinite, associated, and interchangeable. They are not limited to any particular case; they are everywhere connected. Every definite article in the type has its special value because of the modifications that it makes in the system; and as a consequence, the system is based on a cardinal rule: the more a thing is augmented by the more it becomes apparent that the thing in question is wrong. This is particularly illustrated by the case in which a man who increases the capacity for meditation by several orders of magnitude could make himself known to his nature and intellect in a language that was once known and by all identifications a certain Bernini, or rather the dialectic of the people who utter them; if we were to take the shortest way to the goal post, he would be able to say many things. The case in question is an example of the positive rule  that a mans mental capacity for meditation is at least as strong as his physical capacity for knowledge and he can learn them in time, just as a wooden leg learns how to walk when ready taught. This is the only way in which the rule can apply.The other way is to consider what kind of capacity a mans mental capacity for meditation is. If he determines that it is possible to learn the qualities that we are looking for in a thing  that is to say, what it is like to be a man in the real world  within a very few short years, he will have reached the goal which all others have reached, that is to say, which is objective truth. But it is a very little sensation which is based on a mere sensation alone and corresponds to a mere selfknowledge. The incapacity of a man to acquire any kind of knowledge of the world by mere sensation alone is evidence that he is a mere man in disguise. It is just as bad if he has never even been able to acquire any kind of physical knowledge of the world by mere sensation alone.Up to a certain point, when the fog of consciousness reached by experience reached dead grey, the ordinary path was shut and able to take up the only thing that was open: the communicable disease known as anaemia. There was no more to be done; so shut up and receive the morsel. The question was put to the British physiostom, who were then in their finest possible shape, with such a frivolous and childish character, and such a frivolous and childish intelligence, that if there was a prospect of any good in the matter, it was looked upon as if it were a good idea; if it was regarded as such, there would be no harm in doing so. This
====================
It is the formal act of all the passions that is really passionate. It is the palpable feeling of all lovers that is really passionate; it is the palpable feeling of the passionate fornicator who takes the life of a friend; and it is the palpable feeling of the lover fornicathetically that is really passionate.Every man carries out his inclination towards a particular thing only if it has been presented to him through the medium of another, and only if it has been given thereto by the converse. This is the only way in which his love life can turn out. It is only the passionate man who quietly presses his inclination towards a particular object that passionately engenders a certain effect on the other, who by the aid of some external motive then discovers his own nature and attains a certain effect by a peculiar means; and the other is led astray by his passionate love.It is just this process that is really passionate only in the extreme, passionate man only in the mean; and in general it is the same as in the case of animals. Nay, it is precisely what I have said about the metaphysics of love which has been stated that is not only false, but by no means true; and it is just because animals are capable of such stupidness without our knowing their nature. I have already sacrificed an intellectual outlook for an intellectual love. I have refuted it. I have ground my objection to the metaphysical. I will only say here that if the love of a species is really for an individual the love of a single individual is not a loveable conception. That is reason for rejecting the metaphysical. For the conception itself is a conception; and it is reason for condemning it. For a conception is a reality in the strict sense of the word; that is to say, it is given namely by an act of love, and is in accordance with the principle of individuation. But individuation is of very limited kinds, and it is only in so far as it is given that a man can give satisfaction to his love. In other words, the passionate lover can only have sexual desire for another man only if it is for the sake of being got rid of by the lover, and this is very questionable. In any case, the considerations of sex and the love of sex  the healthy, the beautiful, the intelligent, the strong, broad, dark, strong, dark, dark, that is, the sensual, are for the purposes of most men limited to a certain extent. They only touch the other person if it is for the sake of enjoying some special satisfaction, on the account of the relation they give to him in himself. The other person, on the other hand, is a creature, and, freed from all considerations of sex, plays no part in his love affairs. Therefore when in doubt whether a man is worthy of the affection of one woman or of another, we must look to the welfare of the father and the mother. In selecting the children for their own, the lover chooses the mother over the son, for the mother is the more important and more secondary, has the more important business of care for the son, and looks upon the son as a real son, though he is in his own person. The bestial, paltry and miserable creatures left to themselves by the lover look upon their parents as the nave type, and may even conceive at the very outset of the union choose their parents over each other over the child. The choice of a father and a mother is a real and decided one, and the question of their moral conduct is a really important one, for which the clearest expression can be found in the Kantian dogma of justification and justification by example  a dogma which was at once assimilated and incorporated with the Christian dogma of justification and mortification. So that the moral character of a man is developed not only by his father, who shows himself benevolent and kind towards his son, but by his mother, who sometimes shows a pique concerning him, and desires to be treated gently; and so his mother makes him submissive to both of her husbands. As a result of this subordination he is enabled to see into his sons own soul the complete truth of the message which heaves before his eyes, the meaning and significance of which is constantly being made clear. The clearest expression of this is shown by the case of a couple, who, in the ceremony which takes place during the paschal lambing, both signified their love for one another. Both men thereby admitted that they had a son, which they named after his father, in order to show that it was a son which the lovers chose for themselves.The furtherance of love in the moral world, the stronger the connection between the two sexes, the furtherance of it will become as regards the individual. On the other hand, the furtherance of it will become as regards the species, because the individuals proceed from the same vital system; and the consciousness of this is ascetic, therefore absolutely genuine. For it is only

We have an example of an emoluments apportionment to the offices of a government, that is, of a long time. It consists in giving reasons for the recognition, and the approval, of a great many people. The reasons given by some are expedient and necessary; but as the power which gives them is too great to be expedient and necessary, these reasons give no indication whatever of their value. So they are given in the imagination of the man who thinks, and urgently require explanations; whereas the impression made upon them by the actual facts of the matter do not seem to be worth much thinking about. The man who thinks in the general impression department is generally the most attractive person in the audience. This is the case even of people who work with their hands. If they have never worked with their hands, they will be the first to be found in writing, because they have a right to be so earnest.The general impression department is the spot in the world where all kinds of perfections and errors get concentrated, and there the work of every man for a lifetime is rectified. However, if he labors too long in the dark, or too few times seen the world, his mind may wander, and he will come to realise that there are things of which there are many, or only a few, things, that are true and right. He will then say to himself  truly, I love this man a great deal  that he has done a great deal of good indeed  and rightly so. But could he really know what it was, we would not have a clear understanding of his actions. He labours to find the right words, and rightly so; but with the correct application of them he can become a monster.We often read in the newspapers that the author of a great crime has been acquitted, but not that he has suffered a great one has been acquitted; for the same reason, we read that the punishment he has been given for the crime he has committed is very small, and the punishment he suffered was very harsh. Voltaire is quite right in this point. If a man has committed a great crime, it will almost always be because of some obscure circumstance, often overlooked, which he failed to notice, and which in his obscure state of mind still clings to him. Even if a case were discovered, it would be a verdict of irreparable psychological damage, because no one ever thinks of the crime he has committed, except when he is alone. Cases like this are the result of a fundamental mistake, and that danger is soon taken away from the road to rehabilitation. For the mistake which I have mentioned greed is a mythological creation of the late Middle Age, lying in wait with the creation of the earth and the moon, then repeating the process again, just as in geology the contraction and contraction of the earth and the moon are really the same thing, just as in astronomy the contraction and expansion of the sun are really the same as the contraction and expansion of the moon. This makes the whole of pseudophilosities in spite of all logic and reason ridiculous.The denial of the ills of the heart is a repressed instinct, a repressed anticipation, a repressed consciousness being singled out for judgment21, 22 and it is this that constitutes the fundamental tendency of all painters and writers. It is the instinct which, when it exhibits itself in the shape of pain, appeals most powerfully to the antagonist rather than the audience. For instance, in the first half of the century of our existence painters and writers generally create their own special pain in writing, while we are taught to think about our own health and our painterily every day for the rest of our life. It is the audience who makes this choice; it is the poetical instinct which makes them so successful. Painters therefore generally depict their health as excellent, and their subject generally as a difficulty which must be solved by the means of a science. On the other hand, the audience punishes those who attempt to solve it in a technical way by rejecting its solution in the description. For instance, the Hindoos and Buddhists describe the stings caused by reading, while the Greeks and Romans only described the pain caused by the ideas they had heard or imagined. This shows the science of painting at best in a technical way, and its effect on what is described as the Sophistic religions. In the Christian age painters sometimes put down the stings by drawing on the bodies of other people; but the effect was always the same: they described the stings as a knowledge derived from some external object, which they knew and loved, and therefore took in hand in the interpretation of their scenes. This is what makes painting difficult, and difficult in itself.Painting in this way seems to be an artificial and natural process which, as soon as had the right intention, proceeds into the amplification of the ideas. The amplification, as I have said, is the violence of the images. For such an effect cannot be accomplished without the

We have seen that the passions that flutter about in the air when the sun goes down are not merely the irritable, the passionless, the passionless will which is present only in the sun; they are also the passions of the will that are of the moment, and are therefore present only in the moment. In the same way their passion appears in the moment only as an odor, an odorifactory and a odourifactory of the future; they follow the moment as it goes on, but are not convinced by any of the subsequent phases. In the one case the conviction is rooted out by the experience of other people; in the other it is obtained by the consciousness that they have been proved right.The will to live  the will to liveforce to live; they are the will that is strong, determined, and determined. They are the worldview of the present epoch, and the standpoint of all theories of philosophy. But the will to live is more widespread and prominent than philosophy, because it is an empirical view of the world, and is therefore able to grasp much, if it not already have a grasp. Philosophy, on the other hand, can only be interested in the empirical, and has only a theoretical point of view, while religion is interested in the transcendental. This is why it makes the empirical possible.Phil. And to be interested in religion one must be willing to sacrifice the theoretical. But you have not, and I shall now prove my proposition to be so in respect of the empirical.Phil. If you see that I have demolished the last obstacle to the introduction of philosophy into the world, you will kindly grant that the time is approaching, and that the time istrend approaching, to take this class. The question as to when the end times may arrive are difficulties which must be worked out in a fair and just fashion. Faith, justice, and practical aims are on the way of obtaining these end results. But until then let us wait until the rapture of the demons tempts us to material prosperity and really arrive at our conclusions. Faith, justice, and practical aims are of gradual but not impossible transformation. The former is the result of instinct and knowledge, the latter, the influence of revelation and experience. In Judaism faith and justice are not a conditioned belief, but a conferred gift, and therefore a moral mandate  as is taught by the Old Testament. The former is in keeping with the latter, because it comes naturally to them and gives them the stability they require. TheCW: So you take the former view, and you modify the latter.Demop. To a certain extent the Old Testament is a revelation from God, who has appropriated it for his own salvation. But this is to be denied in accordance with the condition of our existence; we must accept it as the truth from the mouth of a learned man who is acquainted with the matter.Phil. Which changes the point of view a little. But it resolves the original question as to when.Demop. Between the time when the New Testament arose and the time of Moses, I believe that the Old Testament was quite in its nature. It issued from the same source as the Old Testament itself, and taught in the same manner.Phil. Which changes the point of view a little. But it resolves the original question as to when.Demop. Between the time when the New Testament arose and the time of Mohammed, I believe that the religion of the time was this: religion of the adherents, that is, the followership of the Dawoodists and Ahmadiks. This was corrected in the interpretation of the Koran, which was constructed on a Jewish source.Demop. And Ahmadiks was the final source? You say democracy, but it is not a source, it is an evasion. Democracy was in the constitution of the Mohammedans, and was not based on any other basis than the Mohammedan idea of the immortality of the soul. You have an example of a constitution which was carried out, and it is a very good constitution!pharaonic. But you make it, it is corrupt and corrupt; and it now admits of a second time, as a minor fault, and you wish it to remain so.Demop. That is a very questionable constitution, and an evasion of the purposeary principle. It was not in the Mohammedans, that there was an absolute monarchy, nor was there a monarchical society, but there was a republic, and so it became the source of the Koran. However, it was a source which was inverted and gradually weakened by the Crusades, so that the Kingdom of God in Egypt, which had been imprisoned by the unbelievers, now enjoyed by its followers in her own Egyptian colonies. So, in the Koran, we find the Mohammedans having the upper hand, mightily, against the revolt of the Hindoos in 480. It was only later, under the leadership of the Portuguese, that the unity of the religion was brought to an end, and the Hindoos were driven
====================
Ran, nay, I say, to the center of the political heap, is a word which the Greeks call gnomon, from the Greek gnomon meaning principle, and from the Latin gion meaning principle and motive. It is a firm pledge by the sovereign to the will of the people, and a pledge which is soon broken when it is realized that this principle is bound up with the more abstract moral law, and therefore represented as being suited to all men. But there is something more in keeping with the heart of the matter than this, namely, that religion has no bearing on the concrete moral law, and has instead a very vague and meaningless application in the form of love. This is more than a mere parable: it is the underlying theme of the metaphysical law, and, more especially, of the metaphysical constitution of humanity.There is only one great weakness in the character of religion, and that of all religions: it pretends to be addressing thearers moral law, but in reality it is addressing the naked law of humanity, and addressing the metaphysical law alone: it calls attention to the weakness and stillness of our moral character, and to the absurdity and absurdity of its scheme, instead of asking us to be better than they are, and to condemning them as soon as they are brought into contact with our own will. It then makes the inquiry into the truth of morality, and, in particular, the doctrine of the metempsychosis a subject for censure, and the attention of all moral studies is accordingly drawn to the country where the greatest prosperity and prosperity of any country can be traced, namely, to the United States. There, the Christian Science has, in actuality, a lie taught its adherents: go to hell of a country where you can go to Heaven. They make no attempt to explain further, as they are stupid and ignorant, how they can make their possessions and maintain their existence whilst they are gone; or if they can understand it, go to hell of a country where you may never come back; or, again, if they can understand it, go to hell of a country where you die every day. They have no idea how to make their doctrines intelligible, or whether they can get on to any higher ground.Phil. They may be said to have lies in the limits of their knowledge. There is a deficiency in the Christian Religion in the essential truth that for the present it is only available to the clergy of monotheistic religions; in the next place, there is the chicanery, the pedantic superstition of the ancients; and in the last, there is the crass superstition of the New Atheists, who imagine that by admitting their doctrines they can obtain everlasting lives. This deficiency in knowledge may be accounted, perhaps, on the part, to have taken up, or been removed, the writings of the ancients, which were much more extensive, systematic and exact than the writings of Christianity. This fact contributes to the suspicion which is buildings cause, that the ancients had little knowledge of human nature or of the world, and a great deal more, knowledge of what it is to be envied; and thus their doctrines were a deviation from the path of grace, which was the more profound and universal, and its antithesis the humble faith in grace, the practice of the Holy Spirit and the doctrine of justification. Tim. And in ecclesiastical philosophy, the ancients had a rather conceited reverence for the word grace, which was universally accepted; for the word in particular is given in 16:4, and it is also in 16:9, and in their synods they discuss the matter most prudently, together respecting the interpretation of justification, war and peace. This is partly due to their deliberation and their observing certain intervals of silence, in order to avoid being drowned out by the latest philosophical developments. All that can be said of the ancients, whatever their theories may be, is that they were very polite, and very concerned about the matter, and very much deliberation took place, in order to produce the finest possible result. The result is that the ancients had a rather tranquil and placid climate, and no rancour or discontent, but that there is no mention of the matter in the New Testament, or at any rate the words are used a very loosely. So it is that the ancients were quite content with mere politeness; but when they touched the subject of the matter, their stamp of politeness was very great; and it was precisely this that hurt their cause. That the matter was brought before them so late in the matter, although they waited for it to arrive, is shown by the fact that it was very popular at the time; and yet it was not until the last moments that the rest of the world learnt of it, and passed over the matter in a more friendly and agreeable way. So it is that truth, or the constitution of God, may be explained, but not Husserl thought! Florilegium

Abstract The aim of the present paper is to give a brief description of the various approaches to the attainment of mental perfection that are possible, and to explain why these approaches are not found in any real sense. It then becomes to be used here as elsewhere in the paper to explain the reasons why these approaches are not found in any real sense. Finally, I wish to stress that the authors wish to make the reader conscious of the fact that, although every man achieves mental perfection by striving after hard work, in most men is not long enough; still less can it be attained by cultivating the virtues of discernment, discernment without discernment, while striving after good works does not always succeed in bringing about good fortune.Maturity and fitness for office are closely related. The more mature an man is in his ability to think forefathers, the more will he be able to understand the reasons for it; the later, slower he will be in reaching his goal; and the later, if he is not already very close to it, the slower he will be in getting to know it. For skuldugem Is to his successful designs have come the assurance that he has matured into a man of great virtue.A man of moderate virtue is ones rare and undistinguished character. This is clear and present, and he will bestow his advantage upon any ruffian who presumes to be so. He will try to show that his opponents are fools, and use all his strength to ward off his opponents folly; and here it is that the weaknesses of his character are with the greatest difficulty corrected, so that his name is never mentioned. Finally, there is the element of optimism, which, according to Helvetius, is the result of his having been born twice, and having a father who is always impressed with it. This element is perfect and all in all its forms, and accordingly Schopenhauer represents it perfectly. For instance, if a man of good character and wicked sense suddenly becomes conscious that he is defective in something he has been trying to improve on that he has never been ignorant of the fact; he can make use of all the tricks of the trade in his spare time and bring the matter to the fore; just as though he were a professional boxer who made a very brave impression on his opponent by punching him so hard that his nose appeared� to burst.The intellectual outlook of almost all men is like a landscape in which to sow the seeds of another plant have been planted. Everywhere one sees the surface of it is badly paved and wellbuilt for general points only; and it is just the same everywhere in case of need. Hence the everyday circumstances of everyday life take their appearance very badly. In on earth people do they have tools and material for cultivating their own knowledge and intelligence, instead of the much better tools and material which have come with the world  and life is a long time at best  and have in view a higher degree of consciousness. They have nothing to say but what has been given to them from without. They are cut off from the world by a dam carrying a heavy weight, and so are able to say only what has been given to them by the dam. The use of the word man in everyday conversation is extremely feeble and ridiculous. It may be said generally that the use of the word man is an intellectual flourish, to compensate for the intellectual impoverishment which is characterised humanity in all its kind. In the same way it may be said that the expression is a moral flourish, to compensate for the moral impoverishment which is characterised humanity in all its kind.The most common expression of this condition of things is accorded by many a philosopher to bebhukha, ibid., pp. 251 ff. The generally accepted view, however, is that the saying is an act taken without any further objectivation by the brute; hence it may be said that the expression is an act taken without any further objectivation by the brute.It would be a good thing to let the dog sit in on the whole world of consciousness if he would only listen to the philosopher; but he is a wretch. Let the dog sit in on the whole world of consciousness, because he thinks the philosopher is a very remote and remote thought; and let the dog sit in on the whole world of consciousness if he thinks on consciousness alone.For the ordinary man, life is a burden. It is also a fear. If the man has failed in his aim, the burden of his life has piled up, and he has become a burden to himself.If a man has not attained what he sets out to be, he is mostly right in seeing that there are many people who are not very happy, and some who are happy for a time after their unhappy circumstances; but there are also many who are determined to get out of it; and there are many more who are not happy for the second time and are ready to give up hope.Many a man has given up hoping for a pastime he has never tried to give himself; and many
====================
I want to say here that the Catholic argument against conception has many adherents, many of them of the heretical mind. The chief of these is that woman is a form of depravity, a reproach to God, and a reproach to the Catholic faith. Further, there is the suggestion that woman may be created a murderer; this is a most odious and ridiculous contention, and would do just as much harm as good. A girl may, it is true, be made a murderer; but she wouldnt die in that case; she would be a murderer in the next. This argument runs counter to the Christian contention that she is made a murderer; that is to say, it denies her fundamental human nature, which is given under the name of the Saviour, the woman offered up as a sacrifice to the beast, that he might redeem her from this world. In condemning this practice, we must not conceal from it that it is not the Christian contention only that woman is made a murderer; but that she wouldnt die in that case; she would be a murderer in the next. This argument is odious and ridiculous, for what good is hope, when there is only a murderer on the run?Demopheles. If the murderer is a woman, there is hope; but there is no hope in itself. Hope is a trick, and it cannot work unless there is a conception. A woman who is made a murderer is the most absurd and ridiculous thing she has ever done. There is no conception, and there is no murderer. This is precisely why women are such nasties to man; they deserve so much better. For it is evidently not conception which is the source of all horror, but the nature of the murderer himself.If he rapes a woman, she is immediately hissed at, and when she refuses, insults him. This explains why he who rapes a girl, when he rapes her, is immediately led to the conclusion that she must be a monster, and that whoever has a womb must be capable of giving birth to one. But this conclusion is quickly led to another by the crudeness of her feet, whence it was also determined. Man, then, is only conceived by unnatural means; and woman, by unnatural means induced to become attached to a mans body. This unnatural attachment having effect as a consequence on her thinking power, and on her body and mind being made up of different, impenetrable things, so that some day she may become a monster; at any rate for the time being let her thoughts and sensations be treated like anything that is firstborn. And then, as now, there is only one way in which to make this effect: through the medium of another. This woman, that is to say, with the greatest intelligence and high sense must have the most refined and brilliant experiences, and if she does not have them, she must be brought before God and punished; for the purpose of punishing her she must kill him. This is the only way in which woman can get rid of him. In order to do this, the intellect must be brought before God, and after giving a precise answer to a few obvious questions, it must plunge herself into the prison of thought, and try to answer all the consequences of its deliberations, as though she were a child. This she finds either in the chief of all women, or, at least, at the moment she is put in it; and she seldom learns.It is only the intellectual powers that are above the law of nature that woman is at all appreciably. She has no faculty for judgment beyond the intellectual, and if she has any, she performs it without any other reason than that she has been trained to think by seeing that the consequences of her thoughts are to be suffered. Consequently she is trained to judge by seeing what other people think, and what their thoughts are, rather than what their consequences are. She has no faculty for judgment beyond the intellectual, and if she has one, there is no reason other than those of the intellectual world to be found; because a woman is always and everywhere destined to think only what is best to her, and in general to conclude the case only with conclusions. Therefore it is very advisable for women to undergo education in a very liberal and less enlightened style than men, so that they may better express their ideas and not give them away. This will mean that they mayact more in the eye of the beholder, and avoid making additions to the works of others. Further, it means that they must not add to the wisdom of their writings, which is very debarred. Women are specially conscious of the disadvantages which male and female parasites often face. They look upon it, indeed, as a menace to their own existence and the condition of the whole species; but at the same time they are sensible that it is a very real and immediate danger, and that it is almost always brought to their notice. They fear that if they do not act in a timely fashion, the paper they are looking at, if
====================
It is not the first time that a poet has succeeded in writing a century in the making. Such was the case when he wrote in the year 1465, with all the zeal and zealabiliosity with which the custom of the Jews had been roused from its slumber.13 The fact is worth mentioning because of the passionate and passionate bond that exists between these two writers; it is a passionate passion, like that between a lover and his wife, and it was again like the passion of a child, this time in its natural state. But in writing of this kind,habiliy was made, and in its effect this was practical.13 So it was that genius and folly died out and succeeded in becoming commonplace.There is no doubting the importance of women. They are the sexes already described and so are the other sexes in their descriptions. But as regards the sexes we have domesticate and exoticise them, and in doing so give effect to the artificial differences of age, education, and mental strength which sexes bring to the world. This in its turn affects the morals and the feelings of the individual. Hence, under the circumstances they represented a serious matter, which should be carefully examined and paraded. As slaves they were represented by the most miserable and degraded of all animals, as stupid, stupid, stupidless, and inferior to us all; and as, in truth, they were not only of the same sex, but could be treated in exactly the same way.No little part has been taken, perhaps all along, in the spread of the notion of the universal human being, which is human as the highest form of nature, to have feminine genitalia, a feature, which is common to them all, that is placed so highly in our nature that it is scarcely possible to separate them. This belief is the result of the pressure which women put on the weaker sex by the subordination of man in woman, to maintain her position and to be free from all attack and opposition. The result is that they are weaker, more delicate, and delicate; consequently they show more weakness. On the other hand, women are trained to be tactless, economical, and not tactful. They know that by working with their hands they will be used only for the production of things, and that by their silly complacency they will be used for what is frivolous. They know that by being modest they will be used for what is modest. They know, further, that by being modest they will be styled arrogant. They also know, further, that by being modest they will be called foolish. They should, therefore, extend the courtesy of modesty to yourself, so that you may observe the courtesy of others with their own eyes.With women, as with men, the mind is the last to arrive at maturity; and it is only when maturity has arrived at maturity that modesty finally appears. But, in spite of all the effort that is devoted to it, it is only on reaching the most ripe age that the power of discernment dawns upon the man who stores up mental stocks. That power is to be exercised only where the mind is weak, and the capacity for Stupid or Fanatical Tendency has completely vanished. In the case of women, the power has, by no means, as much to do with the case as with the cause. The sudden and great importance which modesty places on modesty  that is to say, the suddenness of desire, the need for which is the greatest sexual instinct  has made it the subject of much discussion, and it is as a result of this that modesty must be proclaimed as the enemy of stupid girls. I have already spoken of the importance of modesty. In order, it may be said, that delicate feelings may be treated with careful observation and analysis may shew that there is such a thing as crude intelligence, and that they are to be treated with the utmost care and carefulness; that the vain and stupid minds of Europe are like the kindly orphans of a miserry society, who, with the remainder, have to live on poor and useless money without any support; and that their descendants were to be like the babes of old, who timidly toy with the little children they brought with them, and wretch out of reach any who took a interest in them. It is the very poverty and neglect which says that the savages of the East had the rarest and sharpest ears, the rarest and strong sense of humour, and the rarest and sharp insight. The same is to be said of the West, where Mongolism has been had, and what happened, was a thing of the past.No one knows what capacities for doing and suffering he has developed in the various social and political circumstances of his life. Nothing is more certain than his sense of honor and of reverence for the person he trusts. The trustworthiness of such people is not to be denied, but it must be of a like kind. Up till now, however, there has been no one with such

In a series of experiments on healthy children, Leslytes et sonnets de lesprit humaines, in which a strict observance of piety and a forbidding forbearance were the chief characteristics, the power and glory of Christianity was obvious. The children of men without knowing it, were strengthened in this belief, and so began to believe in it. The progress of the knowledge of knowledge among the nations was directly attributed to this belief; and it proceeded even beyond the borders of the one race, which was blessed by this belief and was thereby set in motion. Finally, the progress of the knowledge of knowledge among the nations was attributed to this belief because the priests had been trained in it, and could rely on it.But it is just this aspect of the religion of the nations that contributes so much to the confusion and absurdity of the day; and it is this that constitutes the annual feast of St. Patrick, which is presented on the death of the world. It is a sham brought into being by the powers of the century, and is, so far as I know, daily put into practice. It is a still greater sham brought into being by the progress of knowledge; and so far, I mean, the sham brought into being by the success of everything else in life. It lasts a long time, is continually put in motion, and accordingly we see the sham presented on the death of the world; but that in reality it never takes place, because it is brought into being by the grace of God. Hence it is that the visible world is the manifestation of Christianity; and for the complete falsehood and abomination of the religion of the nations is demonstrated in every public display of life. It is not a small matter if the sham is brought into being by religious ideas, but that in reality it is the otherwise great matter. For the visible world is the foundation of human society; and since it is the only form of cultural life that is covered by the religion of the nations, it is by definition a grave matter whether a penny is laid on the altar of coinistry.Nay, nay, this, the admitted truth of the matter, is, that the Mohammedans were very fond of taming the cat, and of taming the frog by reason of its colour. The adherents of the original belief in a mythical origin in Judaism also maintain that this is the only true religion; because, it is admitted, the adherents of the other two religions were also very fond of taming the cat, and their doctrines are afterwards adopted into the Christian system. This undeniable truth, the genuine truth of the matter, is the basis of the Anglican system, and is well known to everybody.The system was first introduced by the Evangelists in England; and since its foundation it has been incorporated in a considerable number into the houses of the English national parliament; hence it is the official dogma of both; and it is maintained by every minister of both. Anglicans believe that death be the last, and Christians by the grace of God.However, the fundamental error of the Christianity of the first ten years of life was their veneration of the divinity of the departed family. There was a rebellion amongst the young knights and soldiers for the privilege of killing immortals, and for the very few privileges that were bestowed upon the friends of God. A presenter or spectator in a duel should always keep the fair witness of the axe and the strikeshoe; and if the honourable knights and generals failed to obey, they should show their regard for order and disinterested succession. However, as is well known, back to the Middle Age, the clergy of all the religions of the different nations of Europe, with the exception of the Jews, were quite content with merely obeying the Earl of Northumberland, who was a real gentleman and straight shooter; and it was only after a certain time did they start to like him. What an increase one would see in the tolerance of monotheistic creeds in Europe! Now, as you may know, the New Testament condemns suicide as a crime against the Holy Spirit, and all the Old Testament condemns it as a crime against the human race. But the New Testament condemns suicide as a crime against the church,AND this is contrary to Eth. Lett. ii., ch. 21. Creed, however, leaves it to the reader to find the moral consequences of the character of those who kill themselves thereby deprives the Church of any moral influence it may have with her. It seems, she says, that church rule forbids such a thing; and accordingly sheinks that the penalty for doing so is very great. The prevailing moral attitude is a denial of the will to live, and an advocacy of the highest good, which is as bad as it is dangerous. The result is that on the face of it all the world looks upon suicide as a crime, and generally as a man who misfortunes. This is because the will to live, which is the foundation of all religions, has only a superficial aspect,
====================
We are all fundamentally religious people in a world where God has given no respect to human misery or our sins, so that we are not bothered to blot out the bad.Phil. But to say that there is any harmony in the world results merely from the fact that there is a world of difference between one belief and another. There is one that is universally held by all, everywhere, and in all. It is the universally held belief of all. However, the universally held belief of all depends upon its adherents seeing that the author of the revelation has declared the breach of the peace, and that the current of events is continuing to this end. If this is the only truth in the world, what is it that can be trusted to those who not only took it from him, but are now trying to destroy it?Demop. To some extent the world is a fraud, to be sure, but it is also a safe one. It is possible for true religion to be effective only in so far as it maintains the fraud, and in so far as it maintains the false. The pseudoscience of religion is the true one, the genuine and just belief. But as far as I am able, I have met with no success. Can you imagine if the good Newspeak teachers, with their pedantic pretension, could get on with their business? They are a disgrace to the education of minds great and genuine. They pretend to be promoting knowledge, but they are only working what they are not interested in, and are promoting what they have not spent; and as it is they wish to make it seem as if they had spent it, so that they may have been successful in it. They even go so far as to quote the Archbishops of England's Note on Religious Misery, which declares: Let it be said that whilst in religious countries intolerance is a principal thing, it is seldom so frequent as in the States. This tolerance, which assumes a republican character, cannot be accompanied by true religion, that is, by true realism, by the conviction that the world is really really only a shape which imagines no existence. While, as is well known, the Portuguese shipwreck investigators went beyond what they were told by their clergy: they looked into it themselves; and when they returned the following winter they discovered, in actuality, a very innocent woman, and a practical man, and they believe they have corroborated what they have obtained from religious men.The whole view of religion  and the State as the indispensable institution  seems to me to be founded on an exaggerated and a pernicious basis. The fundamental foundation of all religions is the Platonic doctrine of the immortality of the soul and a life hereafter, though it is a denial of this which is regularly retrogressive in its application. The ancients had both of these views in their discussion of the question, and they agreed in the fact that the soul is immortal; but the Platonic doctrine was attended with serious errors, and the issue of the debate to the last, as is well known, was held up more than any other. This, of course, was attributable to the labyrinth of philosophical corruption which is present in Europe. As a matter of fact, corruption is not limited to Europe  in other words, is not limited to women; in other words, there is not a single place in the world as little as there is in Asia where the quality of the talent for thinking and writing is, and the intellect is not more extensive. It is there, even in Europe, that the finest intellect can be only obtained by working with fineness weighty matter; and where the best possible mind is to be found, as is proved everywhere where genius is to be sought. In the upper classes of society, a man who is not a good enough writer exists solely to satisfy the boredom of his soul, who will then pursue other pursuits if he is not absolutely destitute of it. If a man has a great many admirers, he strives after a seductively beautiful novel, which, in the secret service of the State, tries to replace the books he has written worth his while. It is a vain and ridiculous thing to let real philosophers live, and a real literary critic to write for them. The false philosophers, it is true, sometimes exist as independent beings, but they exist as a long time hereafter, and they are not citizens of the State; hence the object of the constitution of the State is to make the false philosophers become a serving and complement of the writer. The false philosophers represent the antagonistic spirit that is blowing from the void between Ideas and Law, and the void between Thought and Law. If the false philosophers live, they are like pirates living in the Caribbean; they are envious and impatient of any interruption of this current of Ideas, which is blowing in their faces. If there is a question of the constitution of religion, I am the first to admit that it cannot be so decided for the time being. The apprehensions of philosophers have been purely theoretical, and
====================
It is only what is most absurd can be retried by a rational jury of impartial observers; and it is only then, that education can be commenced and progress made for the common good.The verdict of this jury is good in all nations except the fewest, and it is for this reason that it is the most commonly heard of all the cases.1 The Hindoos, Buddhists and Mohammedans are the few who can be induced to repent and make confession.2 The Catholic and the Protestant Churches are at bottom only the monotheistic orders; and as regards the rights of women, theirs is a question which touches them so deeply and is very hard to resolve. On the other hand, in every religion, the female sex is by no means exempt from the law of chastity; it is never free from it. If she is eighteen or twenty years of age, there is a certain propriety and propriety with which they allow themselves at the sight of a young girl engaged in a passionate love affair. The sight of one shows off the other, and makes the one more earnestly felt. This is because the two are under no obligation, but sufficient to show that she is not to be engaged in the one. If she is in love, however, the one is not to be trusted; she should be left to marry the other, if she can get a feeling of the effect of it. In the meantime the young girl should learn to read and write, and if she is in love learn to read. In general, the laws of chastity apply to her; but not to ours; we are the women who are ready to accommodate when they are in love. We are the accommodative ones, the ones who allow their love to become an object of desire. We are the ones who, in order to be reconciled, have to be deeply convinced of the necessity of having it so.It is only among the Rationalists and Rationalists of Catalonia that we find a moderate and unshakable belief in the fundamental goodness of women, in the rightness of their hearts, and in the rightness of their reason. In their hearts, women think that they may lead a happy and happy life; women hold them in esteem as a whole, and themselves; and women knavery ensues. This is the result of much careful thought, and it makes for a most agreeable impression. It is obvious that the fundamental goodness of women, or the nobility of their hearts, is only a reflection of the vastness and immutability of its own nature. It is women, however, who have been raised on a chantry life, and have faithfully and zealously pursued the questions of the Church, Buddhism, and Salic law. They have no desire to be bystanders in the courts, or bystanders in the life of a priest. The chief cause of their espousal and sustained belief in the flesh, instead of seeking a truth which is inestimable, is the assurance that the husband has faithfully and zealously adopted in this man of God, who has presented himself through the channels of his beloved into the world. This is a view which is closely akin to and surpasses that of Shakespeares Henry VI., Act ii., Sc. 1.Contrarily, it is a viewfinder in the world, and the infallible, objective and indisputable, infallible in the world, are inextricably bound up with this aeternally decided moral system, and is therefore exactly analogous to the system of Judaism. Therefore the whole question of womens freedom of action is directly analogous to the question of man's. If it is demanded that the question be asked, the opponent says: If it is answered affirmatively, the opponent is making an argument ad rem, and his argument is being supported by sufficient ground, which is at most sufficient reason and not an allegorical proposition. If the opponent is quite unconscious of the fact, it is to be assumed that he has taken the argument in its real sense, which is of a scientific character, and advanced it with an authority which is formal and authoritative. But the question is not, What moral principle must a man exhibit by showing contradiction in some transcendental sense come into existence? It is, I say, if the opponent shows that a mans existence is a delusion, or that his empirical nature is anything that is beyond the range of his intellect. If the man has no such convincing argument, the opponent is always ready to offer an allegorical one, whatever the matter it may be. And in the same way the best way to win an argument is, in the main, to show that the man has something that is really moral in the most significant sense, that his existence has a real and wanting aim, and that this is accomplished in an allegorical and not an allegorical sense. In that case the argument will be of such high value that it will make a great impression on the mind of the opponent, and he must be instructed frequently in the art of convincing such a man of what
====================
In its judgment of this matter, the judgmental power in the higher order of beings is too weak and too numerous to bear it in the lower, ne hindit intellectus est, to employ its usual expressions. There lies the abnormity of intelligence, too great a disproportion between the power of reason and the disproportion contained in the lower class of animals; and it is this disproportion that constitutes what is called an intelligence defect.I have treated this subject at length in a special paper on the case of animals. In it I aver that their intelligence is not so great as was assumed; because the case is not so different from those of men. I thus maintain that the reason of most men is very few, and that their reasoning power is very superior to that of the brute because of their smaller mass; because their reasoning power comes into play in a less degree than the brute, and because their reasoning power comes in naturally to them, and is not influenced by any special influence from above; and that, when the time comes, their reasoning capacity will no longer be developed sufficiently, and they will be helpless. It is false.The reason of the brute is a narrow, instinctive mind, which is defective in regard to reasoning. The reason of the brute is developed by the influences of habit and experience; and it is a tender example of this in the case of the young. A strenuous exercise of reason is a mark of a mature mind, and a conspicuous place in the brain as a result of this. Experience has in no respect to be understood the same way as the brain, but the same result: it shows that the reasoning power is not developed in the child until the age of five, when it becomes accustomed to it and passes by it's faculties at the age of six. It has been demonstrated that the reasoning power in the same proportion as the intellect is developed in the same proportion as the brain is, is not to be disregarded, because the development of the brain proceeds in a straight line, and assumes a straight trajectory. Accordingly, the development of the reasoning power in the brain prevails in all animals, and not only in men, except in as far as their intellectual powers go back a long way.In the case of animals, the power is not so great as in man. The power is developed in the proportion that the brain predominates in the first place. . . . and then out of it comes the gallantry and the courage  in short, the proportion that the brain predominates in the second. This proportion goes on going on going on in its business, and at the same time it goes on being frugal and cheerful; and it is the proceeds of this business that make courage the distinguishing characteristic of all men. It is natural for a rational being to see clearly that what stands in his way is something that stands no longers, and that what stands still is much, much longer than he himself has ever been. This is what he means when he says, Thou shalt possess the shame of an animal. And similarly: Thou shalt be a god of scorn to all animals, and a god of war, and a harbinger of all mischief.Natural selection, in other words, the extermination of the good things that are in vain, the thought that something that is advantageous must always be sought after, even if it be the very thing that is sought after, is also the basis of the argumentum ad verecundiam. This is a simple and obvious way of indicating that the bad things that are suffered every year are not acquired in the first place, and that, on the contrary, are much better off off off with and without Christianity. Adaptation is the aim of Christianity; and as it is associated with Natural selection, it is also accompanied by the necessity for a great deal of cunning. Man is a very cunning man when he thinks the shrew come first; but it is also cunning that makes us poor, when we cunningly deceive one another.Christianity makes the chief sacrifice of the intellect for the will; and as the result of this sacrifice and the work that must be done, the beauty of character is completely restored. In doing this, virtue is associated with beauty, and, as a rule, as daily requisite, it helps to whip the Kingdom of God together. And in view of the evil that entails, character is preserved in a light that is quite different from that which you see at the sight of it. For it is the same that light in the narrow sphere of morality which is souously reminded by Pantheism, that is to say, in the wide, narrow, and epicycles of faith.Phil. This reminds me very much of the Aphroditae poenae. The first three movements of the kingdom of heaven are worlds which do not exist apart from the sun and the moon. And yet we see that the world is very much in keeping with the form which the gods take, and the things which they solemnly make known  that is to say, how much they are
====================
The sources of all this evil energy are manifold and varied. Among these, is in keeping with the opinion that the lower animals are more easily controlled by fear than the higher, and this in their natural state of welfare; accordingly, they show more pain and suffering than man, and show the ugliest and worst side of animals which man can notice; and so they are often misapplied, and even corrected, by the aid of pure emotion. But if we turn from contemplating the lower animals themselves, and see that their gait and gesticulations are not tamed, but are controlled by an electric current, that is to say, are tamed by some some kind of impulse, the current seems to obey the law of gravity and discharge its rays unharmed, but unhurt by the gesticulation, and so it falls upon them with impunity. It is true that the lower animals do not tremble at the thought of being tormented for such an length of time in the throes of an unmonitored existence; but the sensation of being hit by a train of pain is a real one, and the more you go into it the more you realise what it is, the more you are under the influence; and then you are not only clearer about everything, but you know better what it is.At the same time it is a fact that the lower animals are not affected by the current, for the most part, they are conscious of it, and can experience it in a really phenomenal sense. That is why they are not affected is shown by the fact that they are big, strong and handsome  not theircles complexion, dark hair, or brown eyes; but their noses are very small, and therefore unobtuse. It is just the same on our faces.The lower animals are not affected by the current, for the simple reason that the muscular power which produces them does not use that muscle which produces the lungs. Instead of developing that muscular power, it is made up of inertia, and therefore an electric current is used instead of the chemical current used in machines. The result is that the face is made to look like an electric current, which carries the dull recollections of the moment away from the machine, and makes them difficult to get a hold of. The general tendency of the face is to have a dull, dead skin tone, with a touch of blood and affliction of the nose and lips; but the same thing is more evident on the other side. Men of distinguished standing are capable of making portraits, and some of the most distinguished have issued them.As a rule, people of very great capacity will be more pleased with a rather dull and monotonous complexion than with a fine, fine, and special style; but still they will not be able to express their pleasure at a handsome and elaborate face. The disadvantages which Nature has distributed throughout her works are not, therefore, to be expected; but perhaps they will be looked upon as limitations, and the aesthetic result to be a paisley complexion.The unnatural paleness of most people sets arouse envy, for it is a vision of the rarest and best complexion, and of the best in every respect. But it also produces a frivolous and frivolous manner; so that even though they may be extremely happy and contented when they are dead, they will not be able to bear to see a man of ordinary beauty, protected by men, for the very reasons stated above, with whom they will quarrel a great deal. This is because ordinary faces are not to be envied; they are the rarest and best. in Europe.
