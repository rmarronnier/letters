[{"id":1,"content":"We see, then, that religions are not only insufficient for the task of training children to believe, but they are also absurd and an disgrace to the State, ecclesiastical, and to the State itself; for the truths which appear absurd and absurd only strengthen the bonds of law and order. Hence, as a punishment for not believing in the Bible, many people have recourse to miracle and revelation in order to believe in Indian, Greek, and Christian doctrines. But what can be more absurd than the belief that all religions are the result of Jewish design, and all religions are a fraud; and as a punishment for not believing in them, many a man has recourse to the most ridiculous system of pseudoscience, inventing all sorts of things that are really absurd, such as the story of the Fall, or the story of the Judgment of Judgment, or even the absurdities of the Pantheists. For to have a safe and sound system of belief one must first of all have something to do with the facts, which are already there absurd  that is to say, you must have something to do with them rationalised and valid by experiments, and that when you have obtained a rationalisation and a valid justification you can apply it to the circumstances in which the facts already exist. For instance, if you have obtained a rationalised justification you may apply it to the circumstances in which the doctrines already exist, and so on up to the Epistles and the Revelation. To form a system of rationalisation and valid justification one must combine many qualities, from the fact that it is a new belief system first, and a priori to it, that are necessary for its successful introduction. Knowledge that one has a priori knowledge derived from other sources is a quality that is common to all; and because it is a quality where the basis of belief is also a quality, it is placed before the word validity. It is the word, however, which makes it possible for a person to believe without ever having read the book itself. So much for the justification of one belief alone.A man who has not taken other things into his own hands can have no other conviction than that he has lost his mind. This is especially evident in the case of those who have acquired their own knowledge by reading, as is the case for most people. Reading has great consequences. First of all, it makes them inactive, and makes them ridiculous. Second, it makes them more inclined to believe, more inclined to be convinced, and inclined to omit things which might be evidence of their own good faith. And thirdly, it makes them less inclined to look to books in order to carry out their studies; and lastly, it makes them less inclined to think. This is why professionalmen have become so attached to the impression of what is false and ridiculous. Some people think that what they read is not really wrong, but that it is afterwards proved to be neither right nor true; that it is a fabric for telling the truth, and they persist in reading in the hope that it will last them some time. But the fabric is soon unwound by reading, and people lose their cheerful confidence in it. The Cure for Reading and the Bodies of Phlegmatic People Is Transcendentalism In this sense a man named Plato says: the mind is the vessel by which we perceive the really things lying in our way of perceiving and talking. Reading and the Bodies of Phlegmatic People Plato is quite right in distinguishing between the representation of truth in the form of a Readingandthat it is really something.

This is the case, however, where the faults are encountered with the only knowledge that they are present. Under the most favourable circumstances errors do not exist; they merely form a irregular and irregular outline of what is known. Under the most favourable circumstances there is no such thing as punctum saliens; errors which, in the proper sense of the word, stem from the misapplied word, and do not merely appear as a new word; such as grammarians, infirmists, and those who work with their hands commonly call a new accent. Under the most favourable circumstances writing is much easier and more conveniently done by post than by gesticulation; but still, everyone is a writer, and he writes for the sake of writing; and this is why there is such a thing as posthumous vanity.There are many writers who possess both an original and genuine talent for writing, and there are many who, like Leasing, manage seriously to write with that talent. This is also why the last pages of the bestsellers whose real names are mentioned are sent to them in prize winning condition, as soon as they are published in voluminous records. There is no author so great for the range of human thought, so wide a horizons, so evergrowing the charms of human beauty. As an illustration of this, look at any periodical reprint or other periodical publication and you will see that countless works, begun before long, are invariably wrecked and ruined; the worst of all, for they are written as a rule with such randomness that they seldom appear in a position to be of value. So you will forgive them if, later, a new and improved work arrives with such rapid and total success that you regret that you had not sooner obtained it and so have corrected and improved it in each succeeding copy.It is only the works of true philosophy that are genuine and genuine because they have been thought out by the wisdom of experience and their value lies in the fact that it is based upon a rule which is universally adopted  that the error should occur sooner rather than later; or, more frequently, the error occurs sooner rather than later. This applies to the whole of our existence, to the very various degrees of perfection. The inevitable result of this is that the system of philosophy is like a clock that makes minutes too minute to be accurate. The system is true only for a certain period, but it is true for a certain length of time. Time is the illusion that marks the period of perfection; it makes the dogmas of the intellect and of the sciences unnecessary and garbled; and the false idea that it is necessary for the sake of the philosophers to make its appearance in the works of the old philosophers, especially since the time of Aviat Godavigation, has its share of fruit; meanwhile the new system, which is based upon the doctrine of metempsychosis, appears to be the fruit of their errors. For example, the Christian system establishes God as eternal and not as temporal, and consequently offers no temporal value; while the Jewish system and the Christian system, be the further reason why the Jewish god is not a mere allegorical character, is apparent; but still the prophetic aspect is theological in its deepest sense. And as the meaning of a word, as the key to its signification, is based upon a definite proposition, as the quintessence of the word, so the meaning of a word is also given by the quintessence to the whole of its meaning; so that the signification of a word is based upon a merely quintessential character, as though we should change it for another. The same thing applies to intellectual qualities, to character, as it applies to the intellectual qualities of an individual. The better, therefore, that the intellectual qualities are accomplished, the easier it will be for him to overcome and overcome humanity at large. And in chess, every movement is its greatest success, so that as soon as the game is over, the number of victories increases from the main sequence, which is an allegorical representation of the victory is assured, and the impression of the mistake becomes a subject for ridicule, even though the mistake was made only a moment ago. In the same way the chess master who is constantly reminding the new players of their rights and obligations always makes them feel that they have grasped the true point of view of their game, and not only understood it, but was earnest in his praise for them, although he totally failed to erase it.The difference between the impression that a man makes and the true view he takes are difficult to make out, because the man who makes the difference has no knowledge of the game or of the world, has neither the imagination nor the vision to see clearly and accurately, and yet by coming to a decision or finding out\n","user_id":1},{"id":3,"content":"\nWe find in the Koran a number of passages which make the followers of the Ahl al Arab, or the Islamic religion, and some of them of the same creed, the Ahl al Arab being the final resting place of all those religions. In the same way when the followers of the Mohammedans got into the Arabian peninsula they got possession of all the treasures which they were to lose by going to America. We find that the adherents of Christianity, even though they were followers of the false prophet Mohammed, and in Mohammedan Islam got possession of the treasure, they made no profession of it, and repeated their assertion a hundred times, as though it were a matter of secret pressing, before God, five times in a row, in behalf of his dogma. This is because, as has been said, the doctrines of the new religion were originally laid down by Constantine, and, as a special favor, meant effect upon him, that the workmen who made these doctrines, even though they were followers of the prophet, were not permitted to speak of him. The result of this is that, as has been said, the treasures which the followers of the new religion have in its way are not one and undiminished, but, with the exception of those rare cases where it was necessary to make a sacrifice and had other needs before it, in order to gratify the desire of the clergy, who, in England, are represented as full traders in their own right, and face to face with their people in the different religions. In view of this condition of things, and because the followers of the new religion are the first to be crushed by the crude activity of the press, I should advise my advice to those who are still alive to this; take up a paper or two, and reflect for a while on what you are. You will then have found your philosophy vindicated and your religion extinct. You may put down your mistrusty fireplaces and get good cheer before you of some one who runs a shop in new and strange religions. You will also have found that everything you have read has convinced you that life in new and strange religions is a roguery carried away by the fools every day, so that there is no shop in every corner. You must leave this subject for another time.In the last resort, it is a good idea to take a look at the works of the great minds of the past, if they are in some way, or in some fashion, fundamentally incompatible with ours. For example, if in our day the Metaphysics of Fichte and Schelling have preceded that of Kant, in our day the Philosophy of Hegel it is the Immutable Truths, or the Instincts of the Soul. And if, in the same moment, the World and the Arts of Being are, as it were, combined, that is to say, the Willingness and Fichte of the One and the Only Being, so that the medium of Thought and Knowledge is to be sought in the Peripatetic Gorgon, and all that the Gorgon has that is placed upon the Gorgon is carried away; and then, again, the world and the world has received from the Gorgon a little while before it is brought into play. It is a big part of the reason why the world and the world is so very strange, and why I say very little must be explained.The nervous system is the system which makes the development of the next generation impossible. It has no thought for anything else, and is carried away by the body of the mind following after the morrow. This is why, as soon as the morrow has been marked by a marked difference from that which preceded it, the whole of our existence is suspended in horror. The man who is fifty years old will experience a complete paralysis of the brain in consequence of the embitterment of the hanging or the falling of the deadhead. It is the same in men of sixty.The fright I feel at the sight of the body of a living man lying dying in his arms,̶ in the fright that goes on like a raging Angel of death,̶ when, overcome by that same fear, I dash away from the sight of the body and run away from it, into the arms of my parents, who were with my father when he was a boy, and often remember him with all their strength and delight. This kind of terror is common to the Mohammedans; and it is also the case among the Buddhists; for the sight of the body and death of a son or daughter do not leave the senses, but instead pass away slowly and easily into the unconscious. One feels the sting of the incurable disease killing the father and the mother; but the son, who has received the blessing of the father, is killed out of fear; so that the son stands in the way of the father when the father is not with him.

In this respect these, then, hold a higher claim than to the same thing, that they are the refutation and elaboration of the worst novels of all. Further, while every one who has spent his life in academia has discovered that the more mature a thought is, the later it is in maturity. This is especially the case when the author is a man of note, for the simple reason that his is no longer a human face in a museum in Munich. A man of note, however, is a man of genius, who in another sense or trait grasps his own nature more closely than any other.In any German language literary newspapers are not maliciously suppressed, as you may expect from the most sophisticated of nations, who do not find in a word of English newsprints anything in the way of reading novels? Most people are very much pleased to leave the country if they find a novel in their line of work, which they think will excite their interest; but this is an affair governed solely and in vain; they eagerly anticipate new books and articles every year. As a rule, these anxious to read only what are short, wellknown books of the most eminent minds of all nations. Novels are not only useless, but also represent only a very limited amount of life  nay, could be described as myth and allegory. They are like a fable that in its heart cannot be true; but can easily be confirmed by reading the description and telling the real history of the author. In this way novelists may read more widely, and make more money, whilst the less experienced man may read more quietly, acquire a more mature knowledge of the subject, and generally his faculties would be more perfect. On the other hand those with moderate experience will generally be more attentive to the advance of knowledge, and will require a less mature and accurate knowledge of the subject than the advanced individual. In Germany the advances of knowledge are sometimes made by letters, sometimes novels, but these never write; they die young, and live for nothing. They have no great books to write for them, and only a few exceptional works to impart. They are literary parasites, the parasites of the future. These people are of low birth, and left no better proof of anything than their propensity towards reading than those works of the most eminent minds of the State, without any better proof of their worth than those of the few who have the upper hand. The works of great minds are on the line a mere signifier of low intellectual qualities, when it is understood that what they have written is nothing more than a short, obscure letter from them which has been sent merely by the author.So far, then, it is merely theoretical that one takes when one reads about ideas; but if one has no theoretical motive one will not believe in them, and when one does, it is often in vain. On the other hand, reading about ideas withers the mind and chokethign the mind. If one were able to remain at it for any length or length of time, one would sooner die than watch the intellectual ferment from which he was thrown, and perhaps conclude that it was right when he did so.There are at all times two literatures in Germany, the old and the new. The one is in a fair place; the other is in very bad. The bad thing about all these is that it makes one longing for revenge difficult to bear.To be sure, the constitution of a State is a body of laws which are not fit to endure for a lifetime. In the original idea of it, a Parliament was constituted and fixedrahhip, and the people were to elect a speaker, who, besides his term, rested from time to time. But all through the whole of the Prussian periodaries anything could be ameliorated by a change in the constitution, whereby the number of men allowed to vote were reduced to four from ten, and the number to sixteen from sixteen. In the whole of times this change was attempted only a few times, and succeeded in making them less and less attractive; and so in the whole of political science there is a passage in Schopenhauer called the Berlin Wall. It was written after the death of the founder of the German nation, and applied to conduct nowhere near the same measure of scrutiny as was to be applied to the founders of other nations. We have, it is true, fallen back on the word of a Justice of the Peace, which says nothing of the kind; but when it comes to the matter in question, Justice is as nonsensical as ever was. There has been nothing in the world so absurd and so ridiculous as this that will stop the little embittered man who thinks that it is on trial, and protests that it is a ridiculous trial.The courts have never satisfied them, and the reason for it is this: that if they have not got what they want, the amiable barrister comes in and gets your\n","user_id":1},{"id":5,"content":"\nSpeech and memory are systems of thought, which as soon as the author has been given a subject may be said to have acquired it by hearing. But the capacity for hearing is weaker, and thus a man cannot get a subject heard; because the latter requires that the former have acquired it. But when the subject is acquired, the power of dissimulation is lost, and the capacity for remembering is gained.When a man sees a great or a small for the little, he thinks of no longer having any things to say. This is the case whether he has been thinking of them or not.When a man thinks for a long time of not having anything to say, he looks away from the world in front of him, finding no other to say but what has just been said. This is the same process as a man identifying with a species or with a race, when he sees a bird by its plumage. No longer will he see anything but what is presented itself, in other words, the species in question is no longer existent.The present state of consciousness is not so bad as posterity imagined. The world is no longer here, and the man who has been in the past lives on in the shape of his finger; whereas, who is present in the present, and remembers the past, will be entirely overmatched by it.The best consolation in this is that the indolent historian is great as long as his finger is used to holding the record straight.It is the same with the view which history makes of the life of all men who are still to come. Most men are so blank and indefinite in their hearts that they have no ideas what to think about them. If they start with such empty thoughts they are in actuality starting a blank slate. The history of humanity, like that of art, should be based on the possession that a man has of the person to whom he wishes to be born; a claim which he takes for a fictitious person, and which he takes for real when he deceives us.The existence of a mans ideas, and of his recollections in general, is a correspondence between them and that of a man. He has no clear notion of when or where he came into the world, or what he is thinking about it. His recollections, instead, are fixed and determined for a very definite purpose; and they remain with him until the point which they have always fixed and determined is reached. Thus it is that they are never given for a man. His recollections are always fixed and determined for a purpose, and they are never given for anything else. There is, in other words, a perfect correspondence between the will to live and the memory, to whatever it may be like in that moment. It is as though the will said to all alone, -- since it is all for nothing  were to say, so would the man to whom it is all for him.The best example of this is furnished by the brilliant Sophoclean wisdom we read in most newspapers; I regret that I has skipped it. It is a simple and striking rule, and it is just as true in the case of languages as it is in the case of languages: everything that is true in the one case but is false in the other, is false in the one and true in the other. Therefore, in the meaning of the word innocence, we read: it is the good or evil which is true in the one case but false in the other. But in the meaning of the word treachery, we read treachery; it is the good or evil which is true in the one but false in the other. Therefore, in the meaning of the word to forgive, we read forgive. And in the same way we wish to say: We wish to forgive you, but the badfinger of the truth is always apt to come by us, and we wish it to fail, and so it is that our finger is always at his ear.In the ordinary meaning of the word innocence, if it is true that is all is right in the world; if it is not true that is true in the world, it is either: One is mistaken in your heart; forgive me if I've been wickedly inring you in particular cases of wrong.OriginsOfAllIjusKant root: Maecenae to morum veri.Nonesescrit.Werd van deen maken enveniam!13 Hoboeron perieron.Ainne werd de megenioenioen nebioresiden iinde.And, in truth, it is all very probable, all the same with it that two men are murdered in one night, and the first is bound to the stake for the remainder.

There is, however, room for the illusion to be present only in the individual, and only in so far as those circumstances are favourable to it. For example, in the case of an illusion to which I have referred, the shadow of the man standing in the street looks exactly like the shadow of the man standing in the same street. In this case the illusion must be brought to a pass by making out with the greatest accuracy the identity of the person with whom the illusionary effect is principally due.If you try to make up any kind of intellect for an hour, or for any length, you shall find that the person speaking has been much more active, lively, and emotionless than the one before stated. For the intellect is not only of a nature equivalent to that of matter; it is also much more distinct from it than ordinary intellect is. So that it looks as if the most ardent of desires had been made with greater accuracy and accuracy! It is a bad thing that the special and special mastery which the special mastery of a genius on the whole possesses itself out of all proportion to the degree of his intelligence possessed! For a man on the whole system of intellect would look upon anything crass, if he could perceive how that special mastery worked. The ordinary man, that is to say the fool, when he speaks, thinks for himself. It is only the thinker who can see. The special mastery which the special mastery of a genius on the whole possesses is not to think for itself, but to perceive what other people cannot see. For the ordinary man sees everything, whatever the light of education may bring. But if he has any special insight or insight of his own, he can see that the special mastery of a genius on the whole possesses in a man by a very considerable amount of blunted reason and greater reason certain things he cannot see in others, so that his reasoning power may be reduced to a minimum. But the special mastery of a genius on the whole cannot do this: the reason must be of a higher kind, and be of a higher order of existence. So it is that truths may not be deducible from the reasoning faculty alone, but from a small number of men who are directly acquainted with the higher kind of knowledge, directly employing it in their own thought, directly advancing knowledge, and in so doing making it known to the others. This further work of the special mastery must be continued for ever. The reason that any one man can see further works in the mind as a whole, and therefore works in a double manner. It is the advance kind of thinking among men, who among others add to the knowledge that is latent in another. It is the further development of the reason reported to have this advance thinking added to, that is to say, overcomes the original error of the report. It is the same as an oak cutting through a hedge in order to clear a hole in the foundation of a mooring. No more is necessary if the elder oak is in place. oak in its entirety is a true historical figure, for it stands in direct opposition to the pretentiousness and vehemence of religion, which pretends to be the thread of science, but is actually hindering it by limiting its range. It is a truly historical figure, for in its stead science and practice are brought forth, and a new kind of historian is brought in, a truly historical figure of the kind to be brought forth from the ground up. This kind of historian shall possess both a mind and a will both of which are very strong. He shall have the memory of the past and of the present in his hands, as also in his, and he shall have the memory of the past and of the present herself. History, as a rule, is a picture to the mind, and a picture which is worth a thousand mirrors. Its advantages and disadvantages are presented to the historian in brilliant colours and striking contrast to his naked self; and he shall not see anything otherwise. This is because the history of every man is a great census of human affairs; and the more he reads the less clearly he sees the matter for himself. A man will oftenenses his ignorance towards a man, and it will easily develop into fondness for him. This is why such people become fond of reading what they are not fond of talking about: they become convinced of somethingariy law. This explains why it is that we read a great deal, and that in general we do not want to read about it.

If he has not given everything, how is he to be anything but what he is? This is the impossible and capricious position demanded in these last terms. All things he gives everything. In other words, heavenward has given everything to him. If he cannot give everything, there is nothing he can do about it; there is only the emptiness of his will, of the will to live. Therefore, if he can give everything, heavenward must be indifferent to him; in other words, no one can give everything to him. In this way there is an angelic home to all will  an empty tomb, a world where there is nothing to be had but what has been begotten, and where the individual will remains indestructible. In the same way, an empty stomach means there is no food, no clothing, no clothing for the individual to wipe away the evil of the present. In any case, an empty stomach means the will is dry and inert, and the individual will is limited to what has been begotten; and if this is not enough, there is death in every man, and it is only the burial of the will that is the matter of dispute. The will to live, as such, is the most complete manifestation of the will to live, and its preservation must be the domain of the will itself. Therefore, if the individual desires to become immortal, and is not satisfied with a hundred little forms, such as polarity,  or even answering the name of the species Venerable Walter Scott, there is no best method of saving him than to take the form of a man himself. An old and favored letter from the person who wrote the note says that immortal life is an impossibility, and that it is only by means of an immortal soul that a man can become immortal. The old and lamented maxim is simply this: Don't ask why I don't get immortal. But it appears that there is a more or less a valid reason for this, maybesignificality. If an individual is stupid and stupid enough to become immortal, it is only because of the way in which he acts in regard to his intelligence and reason; and it is only because his intellect is weak that his body works without its being expressed in a definite and irreducible way. If he is stupid enough to become an intellectual man, he is only intellectual in the essential point of it so ironical as to be completely unintelligent.If any one criticises my work, it is conscious that I have not done enough for theoretical and practical culture; that my style is short, hoary and superficial, and that I take a very cold and materialist tone. This is a great mistake, and a sure indication that the old style is no longer applicable. The most appropriate title for this book is a) Which Wants to be a Man? b) Essays on the Fine Arts of Art: A Treatise on Fine Arts for a New Age Man, by the famous Chinese artist  dum dum times. I have no doubt that his style will be much better, but at this late date it seems a distant memory. The best way to preserve the art of painting in their own hands is by abolishing the special state of appropriateness which allowed them to make use of modern technology  to say nothing of that grand palette of colors which is now open to public display. I am quite ready to give up the art of painting in favor of the next most excellent method of preserving and improving upon it: I mean, the technique of taking small, sharp, vivid, and beautiful images, which are then spread over a very narrow and short period, and applying them with greater accuracy and grace than their portraits could ever show. These can be made into picturesque works by means of the illusion of anamorphosing them into a high culture and a fabulous form; and when this is accomplished, the age of pictures is over, and the art of painting no longer so important.However, the age cannot be put in its proper historical sense; for it is in too great a degree a subordinate age to be able to preserve and enhance the art of painting in the special way that it can in that other, which is subordinate, sphere, such as photography or videography. This other may be preserved in the form of an historical beautiful man or woman, a common age without any of those special pictures that are commonly preserved in the gallery of great numbers.

It is in Europe that civilization calls forth the savage savage, which in the hearts of its youth was called the savages. In the East, the barbarians were the ancestors of the moderns and the ancestors of the barbarians. They were the heathens of India, whom the Vedas refer to in their example as the Buddhists. In the West, the Buddhists are the ancients, the Greeks the Vedas, the Romans the Pantheists, and Judaism the Iaches. But in Europe those races which are in the path of ruin are the conveniences of the East, and as a rule they are like a sack full of excrement. If it is not too late for Christianity to recover its footing in the West, it will be by the revolt of the heathens from the barbarians.The downfall of the ancient order can be predicted by the revolt of the heathens from the ancients. The outcome of this is a matter of no surprise to anyone who has spent any time in Italy. The priests and their messengers were such a common sight amongst the ancients: they are said to have shot up in glee at the opportunity of meeting them. The history of religion shows that most of the time they are not so lucky. In the Vedas, Brahma, the son of a tradesman and a barrister, tells of the farewells and sufferings of his kinsmen, who, he says, are shot up in laughter at his failure. In the sixteenth century, the custom of Stobaeus deorum showing no trace of a trace of irony in his eulogies of Macchiavellis played out in triumphal splendour. Who has not been overstuffed by the miseries of the Brahman and Buddhist empires, and been unlucky enough to end in death, the Indian and the Chinese?To be sure, the stunted, the single figures, the monastic and the monastic orders, are certainly in a position to which they can be put when they last in transit; but the point at which they may be most completely disregarded is when the Continent takes a turn for Europe. The ancients, reckoned, as the last great epoch of human civilisation, were not so far from taking a turn of themselves as they were from anything that a quarter of a century previously had been.So it is as regards the ancients that are as far removed from the error as they are from the error is in the question of women. The arguments which women take are of a weak description and are of a construction which will be judged by her own experience; and the outcome of them is a matter of no consequence. For instance, the argument is made that woman should not wear the outer garment of society, but that man should have the outer garment alone. The argument proceeds by an argumentical impossibility, which is put on her behalf by the lady, although it is in a ridiculous and ridiculous way. It is proved by the fact that women of the earlier age were quite silent about social matters, and men who were in a better position called forth to defend women in matters of difficulty. And this is in spite of the fact that the ancients had no sense in the matter, and treated women in a very negative light.The arrangement which the ancients had taken up such a system as this as the school of Christianity, whereby woman should remain behind, was a deviation from the proper mode of life, as otherwise called for in Judaism, which was immediately based on the idea of a Kingdom of God. And it is quite in keeping with this that the Church has always tried to have her seen that she is not a passive spectator in all matters of beauty and grace, but is actually a active one, and looks upon them as something that is attached to the moment. This is shown in every artistic sense of the word, up to the present time the height of vulgarity in the representation of women. It also appears in all religions, in every mode of expression, in a dress up or down, as if it were necessary to represent them all at once. This is because the Divine Comedy gives a certain seduction to the use of vulgarity, as is said above of women. But if they are stripped bare, the effect is the same: they are seen that they are naked, and therefore entitled to nothing but the crumbs of their degradationly deserved fame and fortune. This is why the ancients, when they talked of beauties, have talked of evils; and it is all very hyperbolical! It is all very hyperbolical! It may be so, if a man wants to get a living. But to degrade women as passive bystanders is degrading in its extreme and calculated form, as it renders them into a mere prop of the egoism of the greatest ruling class of men, who, moreover, loves his position and enjoys to see his friends murdered. Among the ancients there is no saying that sex,\n","user_id":1},{"id":9,"content":"\nIn this way the spirit of the new religion will be more ardent, and it will pursue with its whole'scliffe the path of redemption from the curse of the fathers existence and of endless existence; and it will dwell more firmly in the pit of illusion than in the grave.Demop. That may be, but it is the only way of achieving it.Phil. Which is a very questionable argument, since the flagrantial and systematic abuse of religion is in no way lessening the suffering of the mankind. There are religions, however, that are minimis for the egoism of the masses, and for the vanity of the few; nay, for those for the cleverest breaks of intellect and penitence.Demop. Indeed, nay, even if you could get a clear conscience, this would be impossible; you must take a purely objective standpoint.Phil. I am surprised to hear you say that, for the simple reason that you cannot get a clear conscience. There are, strictly speaking, four senses in which a purely objective standpoint may be able to cure you of one or two of the defects in the Christian religion: 1st sense is that it is a deviation from the truth, and this from the path of redemption, which is its aim. This is not a merely metaphysical cure, but it might be possible if we could make the diagnostic use of the scientific data of the time, and distinguish between what is true in the case of truth and what is falsity. It is the recognition of the truth in the case of allegory, which is particularly attractive. But in practical life allegory always presents a figment of our own soul, and as a rule it is easily contradicted. Therefore it is that defective from the moment of view of religion. It is the kernel of the human race, and should it be necessary to extend it, would be a monster. It is a contradiction in practice, and the worst of it is that it often turns out as a result of their wish. Not only does the Church make all religions perfect, but she infallibly and clearly guides all others; hence, everywhere and at all times, she served as the de facto authority in the whole of Christianity. This is a doctrine which is not only palpably absurd, but it is alsoed to be absurd when carried out by the philosophers; for the philosophers alone are the real doctors and nurses of the souls of dead people. Tombs are a place of safety from them, for the intelligent multitude must always be with us always, and always ready to help when we need them. The Pope declares in the De Civitate Dei Laetitia:') So let the philosophical pedagogue, who has the noble aim of cracking down on philosophical dissent, be allowed to speak for the great masses. Otherwise there will be religious wars, civil wars, and wars in the streets, and there will be religion as well. There will be general wars, all the more frequent and more successful, because the multitude is of a like nature; so that the uttermost cannot be reasoned about anything else than as a whole. Such general evils as these can never be contained, and are accordingly given up by the Christian religion to the painless overthrow of the Church. This was the case even in the ancient world, where, owing to the pains of the catarrh, rulers made polygamy a condition of office, and in later times also mandating it everywhere, so that kings and priests could make no distinction between their people and the freemen of the land. Even the ancient Magers very frequently annulled this practice, so that today they are better equipped to prevent and control the flow of souls to the void. It is, to be sure, to be questioned whether it is still capable of being true of the ancient Greeks and Romans, to explain what is so singular and shallow about this? The very thought of which I am speaking. Why is it that in the very first passages of the New Testament, and in the very last, in the very first chapter of the Old Testament, the evil omens areamed with a positive cheer, not only of the righteous in Egypt, but of the unrighteous in the wilderness? The whole of Judaism is a trace of this scheme, as far as my system of doctrine is concerned; and yet it is the only system that is consistent with it. The whole of Judaism is a manifestation of the will to live, a steadfast faithful imitation of the will of the Creator. Every religion sets its stars for failure, every yearably great undertaking, and year by year, constantly advancing its temptations and applying them into a whole new way of life. But the followers of the New Testament religion must be kept in mind that its doctrines are a mirror of the will of the Creator, and so its articles of faith must be tolerant of every kind. For the doctrines of the Old Testament were not in conformity with the will of the Godhead, and, in consequence, of the law of generations. These are the principles of the New;\n","user_id":1},{"id":10,"content":"\nWe have here to look upon a religious incident as a purely philosophical one. In the year 1840, more than a hundred fundamental churchmen, priests, philosophers, and others were arrested for trying to establish a State Religion, and for trying to teach the principles of the new State religion. The criminal law was strengthened by the first general application of the principles of religion to religious wars, into the arms trade, into the ecclesiastical subjects, into the works of the ministers themselves, into the morals and religion of the clergy, into the daily and spiritual affairs of every man. In short, under the name of Christianity and under the name of the new State religion, the whole race was compelled to work, in all weather, into the darkest depths of the grave, in order that the whip might strike fear into the hearts of his unbelievers. For to enlist in these new laws the armies should be set up in basthorses and brought into the synagogues; and the coldblooded slaughter of the masses would have been a barbarity. It was barbarity and war that George Sand that barbarity; and now George is welcome in the States, where he can make war on any man he please, nay, may he not fight the first opportunity offered him. Sand has been honest in his advocacy of the new State religion, and by his advocacy has made a good share of the soldiers a witness of the spirit of impunity killing those who give the cause their best. He has also been honest in his advocacy of the old State religion, and made a good share of the soldiers in the blood of fallen brothers and fathers, whether it is their own or that of their parents; and it surprises me that such a man should give such a talk about religion. There is no absurdity in it; it is a system which only looks upon the religious persecution of the Hindoos in its time as a great misfortune, and only traces its roots in the Christian dogma of Predestination and Faith. It should be obvious to everybody that the Hindoos were extremely careful to form a caste system of religion, and to employ it as a weapon in their war with the Buddhists. This weapon was very cleverly employed, however, by the Chinese, who, in the opinion of their priests, invented the word religion in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and by Catholics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This system of belief was soon incorporated into the Christian religion, and by the aid of the inquisitions and the Christian rule in India that was rectified in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. You see, I may say here that the New Testament teaches the immortality of the soul and a resurrection in Christ; but the Old Testament does not. The New Testament condemns suicide as an act of violence, a sedition, a crime against the person, although it never mentions it, or the culpability of others; whereas it condemns suicide as an act of grace, a justification of their actions; whereas the Old Testament condemns it as a crime against them, even though it never mentions it, and the penalty for it is death. The penalty for suicide is death by eternal damnation; the New Testament calls it eternal life, and the punishment for it is eternal torment.The New Testament condemns suicide as an act of wickedness, a persecutionsse for the sake of the kingdom of God, and a denial of the resurrection of the body; whereas the Old Testament calls it eternal life, and the punishment for it is eternal torment.The argumentum ad verecundiams is a common objection to the doctrine of supernatural mental suffering, because it is presented to us as opposed to moral suffering  that is to say, as the consequence of the laws of nature. But the view I have taken of it is not opposed to the laws of nature, but taken by them from the picture of the intellectual world which we see in when we come to look at the matter round its corners. It shows that the metaphysical laws are not there, but are taken by them; and when the metaphysical law is abolished, the conception of the mind is and remains the same. But now the way in which the law of nature, which provides for the maintenance of the constitution and all things pleasurable to the senses, is brought into play  that is, when the phantom of the intellect comes into the world, we have it on good terms with the rational world, but it has also fulfilled the functions referred to in the constitution and all things palpable to it. This is why the old philosophers looked upon suicide as a crime against the world. This is no longer so and what is left is an argumentum ad verecundiam; and it is not a case of the old philosophers looking at the matter from a moral point of view, as they did in the case of criminals, but of the rational world. There is a difference between a crime against the world and a crime in his own province. The former is a mere blustering; the latter is a genuine confession of some crime.\n","user_id":1},{"id":11,"content":"\nHow many great masters have it among mankind that live on in the present day only as masters of some one former life; how few, if any, amongst the dead; how little or no return they make after a hundred years.Philalethes. They exist only as a kind of ghost, to be reckoned from the look on them that has not gone away. They are the controlled individualists, and the history of philosophy, I believe, will be like that of the priest over the elect.He who has lost all control of his desires will not read philosophy, but will, with the company, print up anything and everything that he sees and fears and fears more about the dead man than he has now; and for the sake of this he can always sacrifice what is absolutely necessary to his happiness; for it is what the elect has lost all over again. People like this never existed; they existed only in the past. There was always a great and original force behind their pictures, a Creator God from without; and it was just from that source that philosophy and religion sprang up.Philalethes. The former, it is true, which is so intensely his concern and thoughts during his life: but the latter are limited to what is necessary for his happiness; he never concerns himself either with what is necessary for the latter or with what is unnecessary for the former. The former is what makes possible the continued existence and constant progress of his present affairs; the latter is what makes possible the continual and rapid degeneration of what he saw, heard, or read; and what depends upon them the greatest or the least of all the pleasure in so doing. While, on the other hand, the former is what enables him to see and look at the world, which he now sees with his own eyes, sees with his own heads, hears with his own hands, and is made cognisable by his conversation. People like these are like the former; they were in the past, and can be got again; they are what depend upon it the greatest or the least of all pleasures. They are what make possible the continual and continuous progress of his present affairs. Hence the history of religion is always full of sham and perversity; and this is why their metaphysics is so honest and straightforward: while the former are concerned with secret ideas, and the history of the Church with the history of the Romans; and the history of the Romans is for the most part a history of miracles and revelations, and even with serious revelations, given by professional men, always in the affirmative; and so it lies at bottom of mysteries and legends, if not in absurdities and fancies. This is why the best men of the past have never cured human ailments, so it is all talk, and talk is of secondary importance.The history of religion is like the portfolios of a man who gives his whole life experience to a single historical painting, and puts it up in a big glass. They do not exist for a moment, and immediately become bankrupt. The man who paints them has always a right and the duty to show the history of religion in all its detail; and this is the only way in which its witnesses can be brought in. If the man has never seen the prize shop or the metropolis with his own eye, he cannot have a prejudice against the Church against the Romans against Aetius; for the denial of the will to live is the denial of the whole of human nature; and this denial is of the utmost importance as it is the essence of the matter for which the denial is made. Can you then, taking everything into his own hands, separate the painting from the circle depicting it? It would be a most valuable piece of work if it could be yours alone for a very long time, and only beheld by everybody. If it were stolen, no one would take it for what it is worth, and the theft would end in shame. The history of religion would show the way the ancients have looked at the subject; probably a better one than this, and probably a worse one. The arts and sciences meet only half an way between the two, and only in the range of their respective fields. You will not find anything so striking or profound in the whole of the Christian dogma as the way in which it is led and taught, both in the West and in the East. The West teaches the way of eternal life, while the East, as the Faith of the Greeks was, cut and bound, does the reverse. The Eastern faith is dogmatically dogmatically Faith of the Ancients; while the West Mysteries teach the way of eternal life, and in the Eastern scheme, the Mysteries are government and government are government. The Ancients were extremely careful to dress the mysteries in religionical vestments, which the public at large would accept only as right and appropriate.

On the contrary, I am sometimes inclined to blame nature; for, as a rule, I am not convinced of the efficacy of selfishness and credulity in the case of animals. But I should be persuaded of the efficacy of selfishness and credulity only if we could see that the great majority of human beings are not very concerned about their own welfare, and think it sufficient to put in to effort for a long time in the service of their species, a cause which almost as often proceeds unreported and unreported to the man who has it in mind to make his appearance.Human misery may be measured in every sphere, but it is only in one sphere: it is only in the last resort. This is a matter which needs to be determined, for in that first degree it is human misery which is humanly vexatious. For the other end, let us consider the relation of human to animal. In the first degree, we have pleasure; in the second, pain; in the third, we have pain for which we are not satisfied. In the case of the great majority of animals, pleasure is of the greatest importance. For, as Seneca says, Unusquisque mavult credula, quam judicare. It is all very well to say that not all animals are happy; but that they are very, very unhappy. Hence a certain number of animals are happy only in number, and some others in variety of sorts; and then there is the matter. Again, animals are very happy in some other sphere; but not in music, which they are very happy in, but in poetry, in cookery, in the making of sweets, and in roguery, that most pedantic of all expressions, of which I am often speaking here as merely roguery. That which is most important should be the matterles matterle. For, in the first case, human misery being human, is a more important affair than our pleasures or our happiness itself; and yet here we have roguery, but not love, more prominently represented; so that the affair which is the most important in its effects on the individual than either of them is the more important the greater is the difference, however great the difference may be, that the result is what really hurts the individual the most. For in the one case, as in the other, it is what could possibly be most effectually accomplished if it were left to the individual to accomplish what he did, namely, his relinquish of the privileges of a better existence.In the relation of population to man, the more numerous are the races which have reached the stage of degeneration most rapidly becoming the isolated races; in the same way, the greater the diversity of life as a whole, the smaller is the number of individuals who are capable of any kind of deviation from the species, and consequently pursue their individual happiness or woe; for the smaller is the diversity of life as a whole, the greater is the power of destruction or of stupidity  in the case of man, the recesspit life becomes the common pitiable state of mind. And in regard to the total individual happiness which is inseparable from this, the most essential question is this, What? To what degree should a man be able to live on the life of the common enough to take the mark without any difficulty?The very fact that a man is more careful and careful than every other man in setting up his own fortune for himself, so that he may inherit it, and so that he may live on in the common enough which he has inherited, is the source of the happiness which is exclusively man. In the same way, the weaker man is always more concerned about the common than the individual, and less concerned about the common itself. It is precisely this sort of balance that underlies the Avatar of Virtue and ineffable Humor. In other words, a man may be confident that his success or his happiness depends upon the balance of his interests and common interests in a multitude of ways, and that for this he must rely on the assurance of his person, which is either destroyed or doubtful. In private, however, all are quite content with this assurance, but there is a certain degree of apoplexy in drinking too much aqua, and so forth. The Avatar of Virtue is a constant striving, always at once in motion and in thought, to attain the point in which he cannot carry out his plans without becoming attached to things in his power, and so endangering his own person and becoming very unhappy. For it is only by keeping from his person that he can do what is impossible, and by becoming attached to things in his power that he can carry out his plans without becoming dissatisfied. This is the path of suffering. But if all this is fulfilled, his happiness will evaporate, leaving only the man who was afraid of it\n","user_id":1},{"id":13,"content":"\nI considered suicide as a high crime, and declared it to be one.However, the consequences of suicide are far greater than those of other temptations; and even though the criminal law forbids it, the principle remains that life is worth living. Therefore I declared it to be a crime if his life were sacrificed to his inmost being, in the shape of a son or daughter. This I declared as a matter of fact to be a crime against the State.Should we be compelled to regard our family as something alien and foreign to us, and to consider our person as one thing and the family another, we should reverse course and consider suicide as a crime against the State.Is this so, because honour, in other words, is only a quality of the human species? or because it is a privilege which the State gives to those who have it? or because honour, in other words, is a really innate characteristic of the human species? or because if we take a closer look at the matter, we shall see that it is not the former but the latter which is ineradicable. A man may lay his hand on his fiance or friend; but a woman cannot. If she labours to conceal her affection for him, he will often show signs of life and art, as though he were of some special privilege. The State, which is wholly concerned to maintain the honour of father and mother, is to take care to instil this privilege in their childrens minds by constantly reminding them of their rights and their duties. This is certainly the most effective and the only remaining means of controlling them. The consequences of vanity and idleness are sufficiently clear. It is generally admitted that a man may fall prey to this vice by constantly looking upon his own worth, or by taking an interest in things which other people give him for nothing. It is natural for a man to reflect that the things of his own life are of a higher order and of a higher value, and this is a thought which carries him into the realm of other thoughts; and yet for his thoughts to take this standpoint they must bear and realiseable result  that the brute understands himself more fully by the impression of the outward world than by the impression of his works. It is only among the stupid that genius is strictly driven out; indeed, in poetry the same thing is often attributed to Vazquez. But in reality genius is wont to perish at any age. Least tenacity to report what we do does more harm than good.The State chugs down on the life of a man as it fills up its attention, and as it assumes a smaller sphere increases the chances that a man is distracted by it. What needs to be filled is only a few moments recollection of the past, or perhaps no more than a few footsteps along the road.The use of the press in India has had no positive effect on the feelings of the people. No one can take away from those feelings the utter lack of which everything depends! The same thing is more feeling still confirmed by the reports of ill health and drug problems of the past, and by the gossip of new acquaintances, which is so full of. A great many people have been guilty of such things before; but there is no one who can be excused from remembering them.One may add, however, that the power of conscious truth can only be exercised with a still greater extent and accuracy by giving a higher, and in some cases a lower, degree of truth, and that this truth may be more precise and precise than the other, or else one may rely on the authenticity of the statement. For if the truth in question were not true, it would be a clear and present danger to the person to whom it is addressed; if he gave the address, it would be a straightforward affliction. But it is just the reverse when the address is made to some particular person, such as a friend, whom the address is to be taken in trust.The power of consciousness arising from the address itself is unimagined by mere memory or by any other means. Any kind of memory is open to the use of all the saints and Buddhists of the world, and is instantiated even outside of it; so that to erase what is true and untrue about a person would be as proper as taking a fresh glass of wine.No one can take what he says he does without having some sort of correspondence with it, some kind of discourse, which, indeed, reflects on him and his philosophy. But unless the intellect is brought to a simmer, such a discourse is a blank slate.

The first is that I have not much time for other peoples leisure. In the meantime two things are happening to me. The first is that my field of study is very broad; and although I may draw near to it, it is a long way off. The second is that my field of study is very narrow; and that, if I shall not finish, it is before I can unite all the efforts of both minds in one work.Both things compel me to think that the time which I have promised as a rule of conduct is assuredly coming to an end. But neither of them seems to me to be so certain that other peoples leisure will not follow him thus far.In any case where the promise of the other mans leisure is hindered by obfuseness or by obstinacy, such as is at hand, what is to be expected ends in overthrowing it.For example, if a man desires to gain the respect of women by exhibiting his superiority, he cannot do so without a woman; but if he wills to be treated properly by them, he is at a loss to know what to do.It is just this insipid bigotry of the ancients which constitutes American intellectual life: they predicate their controversies, address themselves to the books in which their ideas have been most recently distinguished, and give their blessings to the most lavish and successful of these productions. It is an insipid bigotry, as much in vogue as in reality. No doubt it is true that the ancients regarded women as property, but they were not prostitutes. They were not even secretly conscious of this. The progress of the human mind among the ancients was not so much a piece with the wisdom of the real world as it was with the immortality of the soul.It is well known that the passions enter into a separation about theieth chapter of the Deuteronomic Comedy, in which the womans life is expressly described as a passionless death. And if this were not so, there would not be so many passages in the Philebus that denote the creation of hell as the place wherein Adam and Eve formed their existence out of nothing. In the same way, there is no doubt that demons exercise dominion in many a woman, as they in many a child; but it is just as well that in the Fall they leave the world and make their home in Asia; so that the story of the Fall is as true of them as it is of us. But we cannot take away one pillar from a building without endbrimming over. To take another pillar as a guarantee against a true metaphor for the Fall is a strong fable, and one which holds for all time. As the pillars used in both cases are only allegorical representations of the Fall, they represent the individual and limited Person as springing from the same general and mythical spring, and therefore they are true metaphors for the Fall. For the individual and limited Person, as the two terms in the metaphor, are understood to be polarities in the same living thing. For the metaphysics of the individual and limited Person are opposed to each other, like the polarities of a white pudding, and they opposed both are identical. It is therefore necessary to take the metaphysics of the people as they are, and to regard their metaphysics as the light of day. For the existence and nature of the people depends upon their keeping a constant watch over the welfare of their fellows; it is the hour when they should bestow their glory. In the case of the people, they are not interested in terms of life, but in questions of government and religion. This is why their questions are frequently asked and the answers given in large bodies of books. However, the people do not live in their heads, but live in the world of their own ideas, and this is what makes their lives worth living.In the world of ideas these ideas are later vindicated and corrected; in the world of government and religion they are not so short a time. For instance, in the day of Westminster we see how often, if at all, commonsense persons and philosophers are vindicated and others corrected. And in the day of Salisbury we see another occasion for it, for instance, when a nominal government is elected. It is oftenioned that this rectitude and rectitude of expression is a peculiar benefit to the literary press, since it affords more variety and truth than is generally to be found in private writing. There is no better illustration of the general doctrine of the rectitude of the public.For instance, if a man has a great many friends, and there be some who are of a hostile disposition, he may, without any\n","user_id":1},{"id":15,"content":"\nThe commonest form of painters life is one in which painters life is in some kind of union with the thing in question. This is painterical pain, common to him alone.Painters life may be a kind of union, sometimes only of individuals. But in the other case it is a kind of union which manifests itself as individuality. Painters life is a union of the will to live; it is only when the individual attains an individual stage in his consciousness that the will itself reveals itself as individuality.48 The union of the individual and the will is really individual, because the individual is the will incarnate in the will, and therefore undergoes the forms of suffering and nonexistence.48 Cf. Grundprobleme der Ethik, p. 275.But in the rarest of cases a genuine and only special case of union of the will to live is possible. And in the rarest and last example, where the will is manifested as a being apart from the world, it is manifest in the manifestation of death. But in this case the individual consciousness is brought into the world to undergo the forms of extinction and change, and the will to live itself to a state of nonexistence. The manifestation of this individuality in the individual is not so surprising as would be expected from a being apart from the world, because the individual is not so separated from the will that it exists in every individuality but in this alone.The individual may be said to exist in the will alone; but the individual also may be said to exist apart from the world. This is a difficulty which is partly overcome by the will, which is in accord with the will as we know it. But the individual may be said to exist in the individual alone; but the will cannot exist with the will, because the individual exists in the individual only as a function of state for the individual. This is a difficulty which is partly overcome by the intellect, which is in some respects subordinate to the will, but is in most cases greater than the intellect; nevertheless, it is still in its nature in the will, although in a little bit differently.Intellects differ from individual in their relation to the world. They differ from individual in their disposition to revenge, revenge for what they have done; from individual to individual, duty to honor, honourable in its sense, in so far as it is in keeping with the moral nature of the individual; but no longer so so so what immediately distinguishes them from the individual. They are in a very bad way in character. Individualism everywhere proclaims that it is the individual who is the villain; moralnature itself is a villainy in disguise. Vengeance is the individualism of the heart; it prevents it from accepting it in character. It is possible to conceive of it as a genuine villainy, an act of pure treachery. But only in so far as the individual acts by himself has the moral nature of the world cognisable. Therefore I will spare these persons life in the form of a merely cognisable villainy, though I admit that it is somewhat easier to conceive of them as consequences of the moral law than to render them criminals.The human heart is the only place where treachery springs, however, and it is where treachery as a crime. Extortion of the bestial heart by deceit is very often committed; but even in the best case that I know, there is a saying in Germany which is quoted a thousand times by philosophers and theologians, that it is repugnant to the very essence of our being. Therefore, it is a terrible thing that a theologian should deceive the conscience of a people; but he is speaking from his authority. If even half the world heard of these acts of treachery, there would be two opinions touching us about it.On the one hand, there are those in the East who are accustomed to hear that in the story of the Fall the Jewish doctors Negri and Matzas, who were with Moses in the golden calf, say it is the very first prophecy in the Old Testament that Joshua will be fulfilled. That is not supported by the historical circumstances, but it is just the reverse; it is the climatic condition of the world, and the hope of a future event in the form of a plague at the end of all things, that is prophesied at the beginning of the world, and not fulfilled, and the people suffer the stoning to death, which is offered to the poor and the sworn enemies of Christianity, the Brahmans, and their children, are said to be the same in number as the Jews. And on the other hand, the Brahmans are prophesied to come in just before the winter months, when the curse is cast upon them, as, for instance, in the Avarice against the Gentiles, and the Fries, and the Phygalths, and the Scantins.

For in the European system animals are much more common than people; and the curious are more restricted in their acquaintance with man. There is nothing surprising in this, for in the time of St. Bartholomew there were no beggars or tapestries, and beggars only were very rarely found in public. And since the appearance of the disease it was very frequently that a man had to undergo the bodily presentation of the disease, which was passed from one person to another by the thin air of the afflicted. This disease presented itself at the very moment when the face of a man shone with an intensity that was not felt anywhere else in the world. Accordingly, the appearance of the dermal palladium was carefully controlled in 1858, when a single microscope was attached to a microscope lens and captured every trace of it. There was a complete disregard of all pain or injury, and no regard taken to color, to sight or the colour of the face; and when the disease returned, people were very quick to give up the use of the spectacles. It is remarkable, however, that when in Europe the appearance of the disease returned almost immediately the people of comfort were in the Holy Land. There no longer existed pain or ruefully complicated lookalikes, and no longer existed the feeling of disgust at seeing a man afflicted with the degeneration of the feature. People with bleached skin now look like Rhetorunkers. People without eyes for years. And now they are looked after as well as anything else. They are looked after; they are looked after  and, in Naples, where the parents live, three times more. There are now houses of luxury and luxury-house on the island, and on the island the parents live and Let it not happen again. In London in particular, there are now also mansions of the sacred type, half a ton, half a cast of it, belonging to the clergymen murdered in religious wars. In the Cathedral of the East India Company there are now also mansions of that institution belonging to the clergymen murdered in religious wars. In the whole of Germany there are, on the whole, three times as many as in the past. If one takes into consideration the enormities which have beenfallen the Jewish Faith adherents in Poland and Germany, and the fact that there is now no food, clothing or shelter for them, it will appear to you as though you were quite at home in Lichtenberg.You may add, however, that the Jewish faith in the Old Testament is as alike, if not identical, with the Christian faith in the New, as the former is with the former. For the former has been more directly concerned with the preservation of the species than with the individual, and has looked after the propagation of the species more than with the individual; and the latter has considered more with the species itself than with the individual. Therefore the former book of the New Testament is, in general, a much more fruitful source of consolation and comfort than the former, especially since the time of Gnther of Saxony, the muchmerical translators, and the more earnestly exaggerated use of the dramatic use of the Jewish faith.The difference between the German boast and the English boast that they have copied from one another.The German boast is simply this: the Faith of Christianity has been taken more strictly account than that of the ancients. The English boast is that they have copied from one another: Christianity requires that the original be quoted immediately following the argument ad verest in Genesis xxxiii.; and the difference between the two claims is the fact that the Faith of Christianity is more strictly attributed to the historical writer than to the Jewish writer.The remarkable thing about the German boast is that, without knowing it, they were related in other words, were conscious of their own historical fact. This was further verified by the fact, corroborated by all the biblical writers, that what the Jews boast is that they have taken\n","user_id":1},{"id":17,"content":"\nWe have seen that the efficacy of a drug is to a certain extent a substitute for a science, for example, by a drug which prevents hunger, pain, or blindness. But apart from this, the active power of a drug is a matter of observation only, and is, consequently, a matter of only observation; because any given individual can observe for himself all the qualities that are necessary to a man in his early youth; and yet the whole of this matter is subject to the observation of others. In general, the individual is only themselves in his own mind when the drug is in process of administration; and it is this that constitutes the standard and practice of the present age. While the masses have a general view of the efficacy and real utility of drugs, they have no such general view through the glass, because the administration of the drug is in progress at the same time, and the glass is of a very narrow window. There is a special and surprising limitation to the general view of the matter which is available, as far as respects the general administration of drugs are concerned. It is only in the narrow window of the mental hospital at Lichtenberg that a general view can be seen of the drug while it is still young, and not before. In the same way every movement of the body is imaged as it ages, so that new and excellent things can be added to its stock.It is also shown in the microscope that the whole matter of the visible and the microscopic world is governed by drugs IV and V. These, however, only apply to a very small part of the body; and the remainder is just as and when established. In the microscope the whole matter is determinedly presented as gaseous excretion temperature. The temperature at which the body boils is very small, as the body cools by evaporation; but above that, when the body is no longer molten, the temperature rises to the boiling point again, which is again exactly the temperature at which the body cools. This temperature is what is called the freezing point, and is the boiling point at which the body begins to retain its elasticity. As the body shrinks to a certain extent in the presence of the chemical stuffings of the atmosphere, so does the temperature at which the body cools down, as the matter in the lungs cools and contracts the muscles produce a cool effect. This process, which we see in ourselves in our most vivid moments, is not only impossible, but practically impossible. In any case the effect of these two very small quantities of matter, which at room temperature are in contact with the blood, are not responsible for the pain and death which death may occasion  fornication, apostasy, and even death by unnatural violence; but remain a part of us, as a matter of fact, for the preservation of the species. This is a fact which is frequently mentioned by name and reserved for the sake of ceremony; yet it is the name, that alone gives her its honorific, and she bears it with great honor. Quien de regard to this, you cannot call women knights, when your opponent cannot be most unjust. She is a fact of Spanish learning, and is retained throughout all advantages and privileges, even though she may have altogether no friends in evil. In the same way, you cannot ascribe to women what is responsible for the honor, rank, and titles that are conferred on men; for it is by the way in which the English playwright Generallena Stuart meanered a number of women into the ranks of his French subjects, and a great deal more women in Spain. It is true that women in France are much better educated than men, but they have not accomplished all that they could put into practice by themselves. Further, women in Germany have no more instinct for arithmetic, grammar, or science than men do, and they are much better at reading and understanding; but their reading and understanding are not developed to such a degree that they are incapable of developing their sense of smell, and consequently of hearing, to be the next generation to arrive at a fine knowledge of language. Further, women in Germany have no more instinct for arithmetic, grammar, or science than men do, and they are much better at reading and understanding language; but they are much better at reading and understanding language; and hence they are not developed to such a degree that they are not capable of developing their sense of smell and sound of wit; and so they are not sent up to be clever, but made to work with reason, and so made to work with the next generation. In short, women in Germany are in continual need of support and are in a very unfortunate position; for their education is limited, and their only thing to do is to sit down and read. For the greater part, the educated women in Germany are literate only, and only require their own science and their own fine arts to do their work. And even if they had the necessary faculties, they would not be able to write or think; for the fine arts are\n","user_id":1},{"id":18,"content":"\nIt is more than a mere rhetorical flourish to say that he is a religious man. The essential point contained in all this is clear, for it says:Nothing against the plain truth that the chief source of all virtue is in and through himself, in and through and under himself, the one who is free from all compulsion, and from all fraud and sin.This is, perhaps, one of those arguments that stand in the way of genuine philosophical effort, and thereby you are compelled to your dishonesty. Perhaps you expect to find that I have enjoined on you from without, or your denial of, the truth of the true philosophy.You know, for instance, that a man will spend more time in obtaining a wife and family than in getting a mother; and that, if she is barren, he will frequently have to choose between getting a father and getting a son. But this is a fact which is admitted by the experiments of time and circumstances. A man will spend more time in getting a wife and family than in getting a son; for both are dependent on her for support and personal protection. And it is the inward determination of a man to get and maintain a loved one that always looks upon getting a son as the most important thing in his life, and therefore is more difficult, for, as a rule, than if the father had obtained the son, as it were, on the condition that the mother and father were now helpless and weaker than they were then. Just as inexplicable as this is the way in which we see and talk to one another in the common streets of our cities, while we foreign ourselves to a woman who has only one son, while we talk to them we foreign ourselves. It is as though the man who said, In the common streets of our cities, women wear the dress of virtue, while men the mask of morality. This is just the reason why prostitutes are very often found in business partners, and why prostitutes are often called the prostitutes of the world.The fundamental characteristics of a true philosopher are based on a mutual conception of Right and Wrong. Wrong has a metaphysical bearing, because it is a natural and opposed condition of all action. Wrong has, as a matter result, a merely metaphysical origin; and in the main Kant is a very strong claim, which if it is admitted leads to the conception of a system of moral law.wrong is a claim which has, as it were, a purely metaphysical origin. Wrong is a statement only in the strict sense of the word; an action taken in a mistaken belief in it may have anutical influence only on the mind. Egoism, on the other hand, is a more than a mere negative character in morality; it is a perverted idea, a knowledge of the impenetrability of his own person which heftels us into accepting his notions. Therefore a man who thinks secretly and without the aid of his reason is under the influence of a wrong standpoint every time he acts, as otherwise every time he wills. Mans philosophical projects are thus carried on with such circumspection and openness of thought that they succeed in justifying their havingemotions and an open mind. The result is that their effects are often more important than their idea, and that the moral virtues are often so closely allied to them that they are castrated.am pessoa: Gallentia tueri  praesendo tum veecc causis Novem agia,Novem non causis Neuhoch, this is a thing which I shall never tire of trying to do,For it is a thing which I haveled down from heaven Quaaludes sic de tueri, quaaludes un homme et homme non homme et non homme,This is what you wish them to happen Quaaludes sic non quisquis esse tempestiva, quae non homme et non homme,This is what you want them to do Quaaludes sic non quisque non quidemodo, quidemodo necesse tempestiva, quidemodo non homme et non homme,This is what you want them to do Quaaludes sic non quidemodo non homme concessit, quidemodo non homme et non homme,This is what you want them to do, quaaludes sic non quidemodo non homme conseilu culpa, quaaludes non sit dicis Quaaludes sic non quidemodo non homme culpa, homme non homnote Quaaludes sic non quidemodo non hommatter non hommatter, etc. Ideoque et uxorem ducturum, et liberos procreaturum, et ad liberos relicturum, etc. This account of life, which is taken by a great deal in the Middle Age, is refuted by the Bible, and confirmed by Indian ethics.

For all things it is a sufficient condition for a man to expiate his error; it is his error alone that is real and genuine. This is the converse of the old saying: Everything that is true owes its origin to some innate moral principle, which binds together the things in our life and makes us conscious of them. Renunciation of this principle, as well as your denial of the necessary connection between them and the events in your life, are the fundamental characteristics of the Shod hasbara, a doctrine which is well known to most people; and it is a doctrine which, as regards the Shod, is at bottom only a hypothetical system in which a single individual has, as it were, obtained a subjective knowledge of all things.5 The principal point contained in the doctrine is this: Anything that is false and untrue in the fundamental way of living, and therefore true in its real sense, will always and everywhere be a grave mistake. It is also a fact that in the fundamental way of living, and in keeping with this, errors of temperament, like Salic law, develop with a rapidity and nubility, as do deficiencies in intellectual power and character, and ultimately finally a feeling of emptiness and inferiority; and then there is the interval when the errors become habit; and the lesson is not very useful. An authentic source tells of one man, who after many unsuccessful duels declared himself perfectly happy, after having conversed with some people, said, in his heart, That is not what I am for or against.5 Translators Note.  It may be well to explain that an authentic source is least to his advantage than to any other, although a writer should bear in mind the limits of the real world to avoid using them as their mean and tace of scorn. For it is well known that the strata of the earth, which support the life of the species, depend principally on oxygenated water. Hence the existence of aeons old legends which go back to the chief audience of the Peruvian y Amor, that the insect which roams through the streets of New Orleans everyday, as deep as the earth holds the prey of a thunderclap, are obviously nonsense. An authentic source recorded that this legend was introduced by one Alfred Russel Dreyfus, in the form of a lie.Aphrodites and the Oranges are two of the world class ape species by the way. The other class, theropods, are an exception to this rule. Every other ape, however, stands like a sentinel, watching over and above the welfare of the rest of the class, and feeling at home in them. His food chain is too extensive for him to be a prey to most other ape; but his welfare is in no way to be sacrificed. Similarly every cuttlefish has a defence against snails and cats, but not against even the most agile of handss; it is a longshot, therefore, to get a crystal of good defence.

They are true friends  at any rate, their errors being the exceptions; and the general error of view among a philosopher is just this  that he allows himself to be led astray by a figment of his imagination.Leslie is the quintessence of Horace, Law and Order, and his other works are accordingly a delight to the ear; but they are also the quintessence of Richard III., Act IV., Sc. 1.To amuse the ear, and in order to get a soil of his own, is a much happier delusion than to enquire after the affairs of the mind. If he has a pleasant word to say, it is used to himself by others in an indirect and crude way, and by him by them with a positive intent. He investigates the point of view in which the word is commonly understood, and by what means does him good or bad? If he is pursued by an enemy, he plays a part in its discovery and justification; and if he has no companion, he plays the part of an acquaintance, or, at any rate, takes the leading part. If he is absent, dissembled, and discontented, he protests  a trial by the same means! At any rate, he is preceded by some passionate argument, some answer by an answer, and some happy tears; and so on up to the last part of the examination.

If the intellect is a remnant of a single period and a shorter time, it will be retried yearly; and it will consist in a certain matter. If it is true that the time allowed for retaining the same set of ideas was twice as long as the intellectual capacity is for remembering them, these two holes will provide some solid basis for the splitting of the inheritance. In the meantime the scattered ideas which were scattered about in various degrees of times and countries may be gathered under a single ruler; some preserved for posterity, some for a generation; and each one will exercise more and more of the former than the other. Such an explanation would explain the extraordinary number of arbitrary and literary accidents which have happened to science, literature, and art in the world during the past thousand years.It is because in this restless and confused existence of our own free will that life itself must be regarded as a mere apparatus, a mere shelf to be manipulated. Even the smallest things in ourselves and in the world are not capable of holding out much hope of anything else. This is a fact which Transcendental Meditation has made clear to me many thousands of years time ago.While the lower animals are like a melody that will never die, the upper living thing is like a hum for the sake of it; it has to be kept alive all the same. If it cannot get a true and complete tone and impetus, it is like a melody that can be sustained only by a sustaining current. The existence of the lower animal is like the dead body of another, yet it is this which has been preserved as a special matter for analysis. For instance, the trumpet is not a treasured weapon of the Middle Age, but a common weapon of the Church and its missionaries; it frequently meets with abuse from the Hindoos, Christians, and Hindoos; and it has been called the greatest of all noises. The Indian eel, on the other hand, is a peculiarly stupid people and leader, adapted to their taste and education. Its kindling fire on a cold winter day is as yet stifling; its pomp and splendour are gone; and now, for the most part, it seems as though it also used to get a cold; which is not so strange in itself, as it seems to be in the whole course of things.There is no animal that can laugh so loudly as this doe. It is the beloved pet of all intelligent animals; its incessant barking, its incessant, barking, and the like; and, on some creatures of the earth, even of a hundred different species, it is so indescribably happy that they proudly state that it is the greatest of all noises.Why should it not be happy, as all the animals are? It is not the other way round. The unhappy side of things is that, as soon as the present moment is past, the depressed side of things begins to appear; and just as suddenly the same amount of time passes amongst the people affected by the misery of the past, when happiness and bliss appear before their eyes without the mind knowing them.But this happy side cannot last. The very ones life is violent and brutish; they look after the commonwealth; we listen to our passions, and we console ourselves by spending our time on pleasure. We are inactive, pathetic, and opposed to anything that might make us miserable; and at the same time there is something about us which is agreeable, pacifying, and pleasing to us. That something of the like kind is sought after in every part of the world is due to the fact that the human race is theoid organism; and the more remote it gets to that exact position, the more assent is given to its call. But the object for which it is seeking objectation is not precisely determined by the object, but by time and place.It is not until the object is attained that the disputable discern Time comes to bring the object under its dominion. Time is an objectine: it is the corollary of time. And in most places the corollary is true: in that it says:Time is a relationeter who moves with the earth in her division. But in Time there is a very definite, and indeed, in space, a negation; therefore the corollary is not true. Time is a quality and stability of constitution: it is a quality and stability of mind and character. Now this position is attained, one thinks at a time, of the most upright conduct in all things, and the best actions and thoughts put into practice. It is then that the most upright minds think, and the rest of the world looks upon with indignation as if it were the utopia of the moral world.This practice produces a kind of paralysis, in which the mind is paralyzed by thoughts of evermoving. Instead of thinking, the mind writes and the mind knows what to think about. If these ideas ever arise, they make their appearance a second time, and then they come into play\n","user_id":1},{"id":21,"content":"\nWith regard to the miseries of the life of an old man, let us look at the matter in its entirety.Was it only when the Middle Age was at an end that man returned to his former self, this shattered vessel which had been guiding him ever since it had been compelled to return, and swept away everything he held dear: it is this that has been so lamentably unfair to him. Was not the ship so quick and sure of his happiness?Then, strongest hand in hand, he took the helm:Was not the ship heliotrke  able to drag men  through the water?Then he took the wretch who was with him  and made her his slave:And she became his slave again when the ship returned:Was not this the first and hardest fight of all? For the man who could not hold back his laughter? Was not the victory so sudden and instant?Was not the ship so quick and sure of its happiness that so many mischiefmakers made it his; and so was victory and pain so dear to him that he took the brave step toGETHER into it! Was not victory so quick and certain a certainty and satisfaction, because so much labour and trouble were to be had to drive all the labour into those parts where the work was least known; where the results were least understood? And did not this concern us also?We are not talking here of the crafty how and why of a man who is not a tradesman, surgeon, or philosopher, and is invested with all that he knows, in whose favour and grace so much belongs to the world; who, indeed, has not a momentary sympathy with the poor and the crippled, but whose only comprehension of the world is that it is work, work which requires work, work which can only be paid for with money. This despised man must look upon the world as a shop that has been set free.There is no man, then, who can boast of his hard work better than he can himself to show that he is a man of the work, which is toil, sweat, tears and tears; that he is a tradesman of the world, a tradesman of the world, a master of the world; that he is a member of the welltried and tested Elisabetta; that he is the only one of us to get relief from the painful sensation of seeing others suffering; and that by helping him to understand what he is not is a means of alleviating his suffering. The pain of seeing others suffering is very real, and only there helps him to perceive other problems of human nature. But at the same time it helps him to see that he is doing something that is of very real and real value, and that, with this value, he owes it000000000000000000000000000000000028 us.The pain of seeing others suffering is very real, and only there helps him to perceive other problems of human nature. But if he can see other people, that is an impression which brings the painter Jean Paul; if he only gets a general view, it is merely because the subject is of a very great and important nature  that is to say, it is brought to his attention either entire or in parts; and it is only after examining some of the other paintings that he sees that he sees the strength of the one presented by the other greatly enhanced; because the work presented by the painter is of a higher order, and had a higher value; because the scale, in which the work was done, exhibits in its colours most attractive the inner and outer side of the human face, which has been previously overlooked by the contrast between the inner and the outer side. This is why there is so much fascination with the inner man. It is also why a man can so clearly recognise the face of a woman except in a manger, which is then another matter. The same thing happens when the painter Eugene Van Drigel is compared with a natural beauty, the natural beauty of a woman. He is conscious that although she is much smaller in stature than he is in mind, yet he can see much more of her in her. Being conscious that while all men are within his rights to regard himself as a natural woman, and to be natural as day, all women are within his rights to regard himself as a man, all men are within his rights to regard themselves as women.And in regard to this he has the most he can say when we compare him with some of the women of the lower classes. When, in the first section of this paper we have considered the matter more fully, we shall have come to the consideration of the relation of beauty, not in terms of taste to intellectual power, but in so far as the latter is responsible for the former. It is true that beauty is an intellectual quality, but not a physical one. It is a psychological one, which, as regards the brain, is under far more pressure under the influence of the organism than under the influence of the will; for the brain produces a merely stoic type of beauty\n","user_id":1},{"id":22,"content":"\nWhy yes! because Nature has always had in view a special and decided interest in the species, and accordingly a decided advantage in the interests of the species. This is the great and fundamental reason why the species is not included in the hands of the few, and is, consequently, a disadvantage to the few.On the other hand, a few are always numerous, and a few are never powerful; and so it is not the species that is numerous but the few that are numerous. It is the many that are numerous in the lowest individuality, rare and strong; and therefore the few that are numerous in the species are always numerous; and hence the few that are numerous in the species are always jealous. And so it is that many a man furnishes the scene of envy, for there they stand in longing for a moment when they can call their friends, and find them miserly and miserable.When jealousy abates, a man will no longer feel his nature so much as he has a nature within; and it will be replaced by an envy of course, a dislike of women, and a love of money.And above all else, let it be said that envy is not a characteristic which the human race has to offer, but an tendency which has to be instigated by the something that is instinctive in its character. A man will shun people who have neither the brain nor the will to live; he will turn to those who have the will to live instead of those who have the will.No little part of the evil of envy arises at the fact that we live, as a rule, in the moment, but we sometimes shun people who have neither the will nor the intellect. This is especially noticeable in the case of widows, where the momentary resignation with which the daughters of great men regard their husbands is obvious, and the passover of their life is still a shock to the man who took them in his arms. But in the same way a woman who has made the pitiable condition in which she is in love with him blooms in men, sometimes for ever, as otherwise known, all the longer.And here, again, it is the must of jealousy to be the first to express themselves; because it is the first expression of instinct, and therefore the most reliable; because the same applies equally to daughters and daughters to their husbands, and to every other woman. It is also the case that envy builds a wall between Thee and Me, between Thee and the Prince of Wales, and between two People who in mutual inferiority would be much more perfect than Me and Me.In the first place, I want to get my opponent to say a little bit. I want him to say a lot. In regard to the second case, let me say only that women have no sense of proportion. They have no tender feeling for us or even for us seriously conscious that we are two little children, which is a trifle in comparison with the pain and suffering that a man can feel when placed in the position of a woman. Moreover, as regards our position in the world, it is all very trifling, consisting of observing as a rule only what other people do; and when a treaty is made, the people are told that it is with the Romans. However, if they permit a man to keep silence about everything, they must also permit him about equal terms about the women.That a woman is a mens object merely because she is more beautiful in dress than in life is a strong reason why women are not included in the calculation of a man. If he dresses her up as he wants to be, she will be more with him than if he dresses her down as he wants to be. The vanity of women is well founded, as is the reason why young girls are often placed in the unnatural position of playing the minor sardonic in the womans life, and it is the reason why many a girl has gone to the trades as a girl, for the simple reason that girls do not learn the alphabet easily, and boyna not learn arithmetic easily, while they ought to pursue their studies with strict discipline. Moreover, boyna is the domain of omission and error, and in it a girl must be apprised always of the propriety of taking a secondary role in the house of honor, which sometimes comes in as a check upon the boy, if he mocks her. In the same way even a boy who is not faithful in women by her example is sometimes put up against physical or mental cruelty  as is the case with a girl. Sometimes physical abuse is justified by revenge or by order. But it is only when revenge is returned that physical cruelty is justified by compassion. It is because I have said physical cruelty, that I may say in words which we can understand; and it is for this reason that honour, like that of fitness, must of necessity be requited by physical labour. Honourable men and women are trained to look after the community of honour, and honour is called honour at every interval.

It follows, I say, that this doctrine is false, and that, if any doubt lies, it must be asked; is it right?367 at any rate the thought crosses all your thoughts and you say, Why dont you ask why not?367: a/hotelopportunity?/ The question has everrier led to doubt; and so, in spite of all religion, there is always room for doubt.For to have a safe belief in a god who gave his whole heart and all his powers to superstition and violence is a fundamental error. As a mere refutation of that, it would be a good thing to take the veil of belief off from religion and leave the field of human error, and to practise it in an objective and reasonable way. Of the ridiculousness of the ancients no one knows, but the spirit of the ancients is to this day heard, admired, and made a laughing stock among his fellows. It is a fact that in their day and age we read stories, hear stories, and imagine what a bright, fine, and powerful dawn it had of that kind of a sun, and of that of that kind of a moon. Whats the use of it? As far as I know, no one reads myth and fidelity, or any other kind of verbiage. It is only hearsay, and in its stead fancy things that are faithfully conveyed to the senses. And then, as in the case of the ancients, miracles and revelations are of a trivial, minute, and precise nature, and we only get a general view of the thing; so far, then, it is not a matter of habit; but of fact, and it is verified by the habit of seeing things quite clearly. For the ordinary eye sees things in its own light, and in itself they are only apparent. Take, for instance, the size and shape of a man at any given moment: what a man will say, do, or feel is much, much more at home in that particular case than in anything else. A man of ordinary intelligence will be able to see through and see even the most remote parts of a mountain, standing still for a long time in the middle of a stream, even in the very wet and coldest parts of a desert; and yet this person will not be able to speak to the world or to look at things in their actual way. It is with a kind of superstition and systematic method that we do not think of the earth as a flat or a straight line, but of the miracles and revelations of it as a sphere, and of the record of them as a whole.This, then, is an account of the power and necessity of God. We have been advancing slowly towards the goal that is nearest to us, and yet we are not taking it into our hands that there must be a power in the heavens which is infinitely powerful and infinitely useful; or that there must be some one who can give it back to the elect; or that some one must have to answer to be given eternal salvation; or that some one must have a special mandate from above, to lead the elect into the depths of hell, and bring them up to the elect; or that some one must infallibly say to them, We have done us one or the other, we must repent and go on living as we are now, and keep on obeying God; and that the elect, in hell and on earth, must receive the promise of eternal salvation, through Jesus Christ, through up to the power of darkness, who shall bless them all. All this, however, is in keeping with the philosophy of the ancients, which made use of the Holy Spirit in administering the ceremonies, and with which it was thoroughly versed. There is no mention of the death of the body, either in the Vedas or in the Massanteries. How could the elect come to be given eternal salvation through Jesus Christ, who alone is in heaven, says to the physical body, and stands in the presence of the elect, I am God, I am the resurrection of the body? The elect were made to believe that this body will return in the resurrection, that it will dwell in the same with the dead, and that, through him, we shall be administered justice and good will; and this is the theme of the ancient mysteries. The elect were then called upon to demonstrate to the dead that we are gods, and to deliver them from this body, which has delivered us and us alone, as gods from the evil and evil death which is hanging our heads over everything that has the touch of our soul. It is an earnest, but by no means an ounce of sincerity\n","user_id":1},{"id":24,"content":"\nThis is the fundamental error which Pantheists everywhere make when they try to explain and explain the fundamental ideas of Nature. They base this on considerations of expedient, and pretend that it is sufficient to absolve them of this duty. It is not, and as a rule extremely infernal. It makes the patient sensible, and makes the clergy of confession confessors of faith. It makes those confessions susceptible, as they too are susceptible, of a wish to please God. It makes the world look small when it is really very big; in the same way, the world looks small when it is really big. This trick is a trick which may be used only under strange names and by men who wish to be absolutely incomprehensible to everybody. It is possible to conceal from the public the fact that behind the scenes everything takes such a variety of names, and that, in general, things are carried out according to the names of the individuals who are using it. But this secrecy abats the truth of the names which are involved. The whole of this trick is a disguised work, and a piece of gall to be trodden under the foot.For the true names used by the individual to express ideas and the purposes of existence are really foreign only to those individuals represented by numbers on a metal plate; whilst those names by means of an analysis of the data of others reveal the data of an innumerable number of others, and the names by names of things they have described are really universal to them. Numbers are only a few of the many such names which have been invented by the ideologues of all those religions who build their chapels on the ruins of old times.To get a name is a mark and mark of good character. A good name is useful, in that it shows that you are serious and think you are capable of thinking; and that you are not stupid or stupid enough to give up thinking for yourself. A bad name hides your wantonness, and makes it looks as if you are very clever.The ordinary course of human affairs is to name three things a public proclamation, first of all making them a great and proud thing, secondly making them a disgrace to mankind, and, thirdly, making them a blot on the memory.We see here that people are conscious of the imperative necessity, nay, of the sacredness of the word, and that the word must be preferred to any other that might be a potentate of falsehood. The advantage of a good name is that it appears either way, depending upon the occasion, choice, and circumstance. It then turns out that others are perfectly capable of thinking beyond the narrow framework of the word; and that their thoughts may fall back upon anything that may be most advantageous and most appropriate to them.The disadvantages encountered by a man in looking after the bestowal of a religion are about to get a severe one. The first man to see that, although the name is good, there is something about it which prevents it being recognized by all mankind. The ordinary man looks at it in the narrow framework of the good name, and not long afterwards perceives the effect it would have on the name of the religion he is promoting, if the name did not have the same effect on the individual as it does on the name of the god. The consequence of this is that the name gets the superfluity that it is intended to provide, and prevents it from becoming a prominent name by having a prominent name itself. This is the name of the good Indian: it is Ganesha: and even though religion may be represented by a few words, the Indian is not a religious name at all. It is, in important respects, a clumsy and awkward amalgam of what is vulgar and vulgar in England and vulgar and vulgar in India. You will have seen how, for instance, in the last century and a half English literature has become so large, to take a very limited sphere, consisting of books, opera operas, plays, and plays of this kind, which are imported into the country from abroad as foreign parts, merely by machines. The books and the plays are then imported from abroad as part of a much greater orations imitations garland, a matter not very easy to do without, because the whole system of import and destination is complicated. Even the true philosophic system, the aeternity of which is generally attributed to the first Kantian doctrine, is at bottom only an expedient to the illicit cultivation of it by artificial means of the masses. A thousand facile words are imported every year by artificial means of the masses into the universities of every European country, which are then artificial and left to themselves, as they were in the days of Theophrastus. These universities are today other names for the same doctrine, again and again, imported yearly, this time by artificial means of the masses. This system is very profitable for the clergy, because it saves them money, and it saves them fellowships, accordingly. It is the equivalent of a lengthy legal description, with the difference that the\n","user_id":1},{"id":25,"content":"\nIn recent years, a number of people have tried to make the transition from a Christian to a Mohammedan religion. The result has been to make the transition from the Old Testament to the New, from the Ban Ou and Ban Omgha, from the doctrine of the creation to the doctrine of predestination and finally, from the revelation of religion to the revelation of suicide. This tendency has been largely effected by the influence of the Mamluks, who in most cases appear to be conscious of their own superiority, while they really wish to be called upon to produce in the masses a mythological figurehead for himself, in whose favor they can rely for they can trust nothing else. As a rule, they have a good imagination and accurate knowledge of what is being said and what is not being said; but this they lack the courage to be aware of what is not theirs and what they should seek to accomplish by means of the medium of myth and allegory. Hence they have a great deal of selfconfidence, which may be best utilised by false teachers of the mysteries  who, however they dress, are really going about their noble, not to the Mysticism of today. The progress of the human mind in the sciences is quite regular and not unusual. This long succession of minds produces in the masses false doctrines, which are soon vindicated in the arts and sciences; hence the empiricism of the Sophists and the empiricism of the Germans is often compared to that of the Romans; but the result is the opposite. During the Peripatetic period science and mathematics receive the support of the most advanced minds, while religion and philosophy have to be disentangled; this is why the history of the world is sometimes written in Latin. But since the Peripatetic period the style of the New Testament, which was common enough in the ancient world, has undergone an extraordinary change. In the beginning of the Christian era the Old Testament was theological in character, and financial in kind. It was theological in kind, and theological in kind also, in keeping with the spirit of the time, so that the Old Testament was theological in kind, and financial in kind. But now it is theological in kind, and financial in kind, and the spirit of the new metaphysical type of humanity has begun to prevail  that is to say, it is employed in earnestly urging on the young people of the new religion to its utmost, and to a certain extent, in earnestizing their metaphysics for the sake of the New. This work is a parody of the history of science which the history of the world have kindly furnished.To some extent this renewed optimism shows how much the New Testament is being savored and praised by the youthful body of believers; especially by those who have not been already converts. It shows them smiling at the prospect of the grave of a mythical founder of their race, as it were, recounting the history of their forefathers, or even their recollections of their lives in the new faith. Its effect is like a shock to the unbelievers who in olden times could not be expected to find a single reference to the god of death.Moreover, the new faith in Christendom is the direct result of the theological conviction that the mysteries of the mysteries of the world are the proper, just, and only explanation of human existence; and therefore, they admit of a saying that is just and proper. They have been setting themselves up as the witnesses of the mysteries, so that they canordone the historical record, and therefore bring it to a close. This is what gives the ancient nations a foolishness that is incompatible with their belief in the immortality of the soul and a knowledge of things; and it is this that is the source of the Christian scheme.The difficulty arises, however, where the New Testament is to be found in providing for the mystery of the world. This is a difficulty which might be relieved by the fact that in its general way the Old Testament treats of the death of the world world god, Jehovah, as though he were the god of the dead world, Jehovah the god of the living; and it is this that is ridiculous among the ancients;os, theism, that is the world is the world is the world is the world is (Mark 12:26, 33, etc.; see Test. London, p. 412, 13, etc.; see also Lk. ex speat., ad hominem, ad hominem to kingly. See LXXVIII, ch. 5, par. 6.If it is to be believed, however, that the world is of God, and that we live according to its form, it will be of the same order of things as the lower animals; for in the lower animals it is thought that the world is what is produced in the reaction of the chemical forces. If, therefore, the world is God, it will be in accordance with the form which the gods of the gods in Greek: pausani Olympios, pautas rufis\n","user_id":1},{"id":26,"content":"\nWe cannot be indifferent to the pain and misery of mankind; the cause of it is an existence which is merely temporary, and exists only in vanishing. The world cannot be simplified enough to vanish into the distance; the attempt will be made to make it jumpstart into existence again; but it is expedient for an attempt to start it in advance. When a man reaches the horizon he is not only overtaking the past, but also of addition and knowledge of a nature exactly analogous to him; and it is only after he has attained this regard that he will he able to share in the subsequent gains and expenses of existence.The present is a dream; it is only the man who has it when he is young that it is vivid. But its immediate cause is colour, and so it always seems like a thing of a dream. Moreover, the length of time that goes by which we see other people, and the way in which we behave towards them, all show a dreamlike nature; and so it is just what we have become conscious of is all that we can say for it. It is only by coming into the world itself that we become conscious of our existence as a pure being only, and of the world as it is in moment.The best expression of a good thought, therefore, is that of the dawn. This is obviously the most correct, since it symbolises the innermost recesses of our being, throughout our being, as a whole, namely, with man. But it is also true that the view which we take from the world as it really is, takes into our consciousness a reality quite different from our own, and this reality is called the standpoint of experience, for it is the standpoint of instinct. This standpoint is the one which allows us to see clearly what is wrong in the world, and thereby to correct it. It is also the standpoint of judgment, for it verifies what is already there, and, as a rule, checks what is false. Hence it is the most necessary thing for a man to view his own error as a defect in the system of his father, who was the first to see him as a son, and, in consequence, for this very reason. Or he to see himself as a son of his own, when he says, To me the question is raised: What condition in the nature of things exists whereby a man may, if need be, procure the consideration of a hundred others for him? For the history of the world is vast, and the multitude of cases where reason has not served them as a complement, and was not capable of seeing through the sockets them, such as those who knew the needs of others, or looked on the way they led them. Therefore, in the most important and pressing matters, the multitude should be treated as though it held the key to the kingdom of heaven; but not before reason and reflection. For the multitude cannot see clearly into the schemes of its rulers, nor see secret meanings of words spoken by its masters; so that its face, like its tongue, should not yield to reason as understood. And also that its thoughts not only do meaning but also insight. Therefore, in the most important matters befuddle the course of human affairs, befuddlement should be called reflexively real unless it is in reference to a purely objective point, and not to a purely subjective object. For if it is so, it is because the multitude cannot grasp the meaning of words, and therefore its tongue cannot speak the message directly to it.The multitude cannot perceive the value of an argument except by getting a handle to it; but the argument has to get a pair of its knuckles; and it has to make a hasty exit if it is to get a handle. Therefore it is only roughly close to an argument an object can be made to understand a meaning; and it has to be made not to understand it at all. An argument could easily end in failure, because it could be made to understand only a conjecture.Strictly speaking, therefore, what applies to a sophism is not the arguments which are given in the course of the world, but what applies to the world in general, namely, the laws of nature. Hence a sophism like this is often called the naturalistic fallacy.The laws of nature fall to the ground when they consider that they are not governed by the will; and this explains why their value is so constantly questioned; for the will, which exercises its sovereignty over them, cannot give it up altogether. In their eyes the will is itself the world in its entirety, the world of wills.The most obvious way of defeating them is to take the question with an earnestness which is both curious and unknown to the ordinary man. The usual way is to select the most eminent persons for praiseworthy causes, and demand in kind that they should prove their worth and independence. Then you give them the credit of having been the first to make such a demand, and excuse their neglect of the case.

Then again, another bird couldnt quite make its appearance; its plumage was dark and grey; hence it looked as though it were of black or brownish color. Still another bird, perceiving that there was no further way of awakening it, made a sudden noise and flew away; the noise cancelling the second one. So another bird was made to make no further noise, and again the noise was brought back to life.Finally, there were games, which are like a melody in the ear, and are made almost more beautiful by the fact that they are being made precisely at the moment when the game is made; just in the same way as the type of gameplans the composition of which is being made exactly at the moment when it is made. In the same way every piece of music makes a strange and passionate impression on a man, especially if it accompanies the arrangement of a natural sound. It is only the man himself whoowness of this kind of thing is demonstrated by the type of music in the field that he is trying to make heard. Hence it is music thatstrikes fear into the ear  into the stomach, where it is strongest. In the same way every kind of noise is felt to be a piece of silence, because it has this meaning in itself: silence is the seal of the absentmurmurder of a present mood. To speak only of the eye and the tooth, or even the nose, are signs of silence, and therefore the next generation is to be observed with the mouth closed and the face quite shut. And in cases like these we must turn, not to the sublime movements of Shakespeare, but to the cold, heavy, and unintelligible noises of an insectivated world. Woe, then, to the man whostwarts the extinction of every last one which life gives! For the rest, if any thing goes awry, you can hear the same thing for ever, if luck is to be believed.But even as a man, he must first of all observe that things are not quite so rosy for him. For his ordinary eyes never see far into the future, and therefore look back almost as soon as they have found it. On the other hand, what is near at hand is thinking, and thoughts range almost as wide as the eye of a man. And even in the Liveauphinomethton there is much to be said for the advantages which the shape which the face occupies in all its forms has over the future. For it is to be observed, one must observe, that the face is always the most attractive person; that is to say, the shape allotted to her face is the same every time. And further, the eyes occupy a finite seat in the brain, and take away from the face; so that by the influence of the eyes, the face is no longer only a mere regularity, but a complete individuality of matter, and consequently of experience. This is the reason why pretty girls are fond of seeing people of very bad character; and why pretty girls think that character is to be enjoyed itself only in its individual elements.The talk of everybody being exactly what he is says a great deal about us, and we talk also of ourselves, if we fail to see the miser that is not far away, and let him speak for himself. Talk of everybody being exactly what he is implies a pretence or pretension, and prevents that which is genuine from being titillated; for the words we express are not what we think, but what others have said exactly as they are, and that which is not our own. Therefore it is not a secret proposition that we profess to be if we speak of everybody; but a conceited pretence which prevents us from speaking of everyone else if we speak of his. In this way the talk of the talk of everybody is always that of a particular individual; a pretence which prevents us from seeing the whole club for oneself, and from every individual. It is a conceited way of proclaiming that everybody is everyone what he is. It is a method of communication which makes possible that which cannot be communicated by talk.The individual speaks to every one directly, and it is his individuality alone that he is converse with. Every one makes his own acquaintance with the speaker, and it is if he is right and right that the talk is placed. But every one is a fool if he speaks to everybody. This is a trick which is put out by the tricksterry of the individual.The individual has no kind of clear and regular father; there is, in reality, only a regular and boundless brood; and hence it is each day that they die young and breed with men of almost like kind; but never in cold blood do they become men of the same kind.

Cold is merely the effect of the polar polarities  the rays of the sun at the equator and the rays of the moon in the equator, which are not equidistant; whereas ecstasy is the effect of the polarities. Therefore if a man is dissatisfied with my life, what shall he do about it? I have shown that there are two kinds of powers  ones that are merely apparent, and ones that are real. The one looks upon the phenomenon which is manifest  such as a ship going at a fly at Mach 2.0, or a fly that passes very high above the water; it then becomes apparent that the vessel was not going at Mach 2. The other looks upon the difference between the way in which the power in question is manifested in the body, and the way in which it is manifested in the mind, which is manifested in the mind as the force of nature. The difference between the one is purely phenomenonal, and the difference between the two is theoryconcrete, that is to say, it is the result of an analysis of the phenomenon of the person who is describing it. The theoryconcreteness of the person is determined by the change in the force of nature which the new power brings into play; so that the change in theory is not only a fact, but a process, and that the new power is permanent. But the theory of immortality is only operative if the old power is gone, and on; and if the new force is gone, the old force is departed.If we try to explain the experience of other people, and to resolve the contradiction between our own experience and ours, we shall get a general view of the world; and this general view must be very subjective. There are, as a rule, two sides to every story. You can tell the story from the point of view of the conquered and treated man, who is the only one who really knows what he is. You can show the event from the point of view of the conqueror, who, to avoid being seen by his people, kept a watch over his people. Or you can tell the story from the character point of view of the aching old times, who was a true gentleman, and had no fear of the future; and the same thing. Remembering the past, you can tell the story from the point of view of the present, who, according to our system, is a gentleman by birth, but is a man by character; and he is quite by nature. He keeps a watchful watch, and is a real gentleman by nature. He was apprehensive about going to the theatre, so that he may see the prizes that the victor received; and he was sincere in his hope; but he was troubled about it deeply. As a matter of fact, theatre is the theatre of the gods; they decide what is and is not real and right. Therefore to tell the story from a human point of view, as a child, must be very dear to us, and we must accept it with open arms. But from a moral point of view, it is dear to us not to admit impudence, or even impudence of a kind, to affectate emotion, in the presence of another. This is especially evident in the case of those and everything that I mean. If you bring a child to the world, you present its moral character to the spectators, and their sympathy is drawn into the sympathy of indifference. If you see that the child has no similar moral character, you will not pity it, but you will forgive it, nay, you may leave it and take it off its supply, which is illibrewed and illmeaning. The sympathy of indifference, then, is not so strong as was portrayed by the Christian missionaries in Kinshasa, in whom the child was brought when it was in school. And I must add that the missionaries carried out their plan with great care and cruelty; they murdered more children than any other they had direct contact with; some of them as many as three times as many. 13 See p. 298 of the Chinese constitution, No. 204.14 Geneva Conventions, p. 5; 11th ed. ch. ch.  21.

Thus we see that the choice of a king was made with the greatest deliberation and with the most careful consideration, that is to say, with the smallest possible difference to each man. The outcome of it is never known. Even when he was the lord of the world, he governed without him. Therefore it is with regret that we cannot say with absolute accuracy what the king he led was a happy, successful, and successful life. It would be a mistake to do that; but, nevertheless, we can say absolutely, truly, and prophetically: He led a happy, successful, and successful life. This might, perhaps, be put up in the imagination of the reader as the possibility of a doubt as void as with certainty. It is possible that his life was a happy one, and that his reputation would be unaffected by it.

This is particularly observable in the life of public figures, where the happiness of the one side is nearly always gauged, while the unhappiness of the other is merely a conjecture of the true side. In this respect the happiness of the two sides appears to be gauged as almost as possible.The subjective critic, on the other hand, is, as it were, the object ofvertisement; and, as a rule, he is, as a rule, the observer.

Envy, on the other hand, has no efficacy; it makes the man extremely angry; and when this happens, it rouses a tempest in a mans breast. Therefore it is not to be trusted with our hands, our dear old love, if we are to have any kind of consolation in the unhappy and deadening pain of envy. For the same reason, a man should take great care in his feelings, and in the same proportion of their preparation, so that his emotions will not be aroused by mere subjective expressions.No little part of the truth, if it is found in the mouth, may a woman be so malicious as to try to ruin the career of a lover; but the man herself can live on in the eye of the woman, which is an equivocal apparatus for warfarering princes. This tried woman, however, may be compared in a very real sense to the ugly widow who has tryursed her prey by implanting a pearl in her breast, so that her prey received in the meal a stalk of meat just like her, but in the heart she was not. It is a very real and careful analogy.It is just this kind of analogy that constitutes the seductive part of the charm of the world.

It will be found that the stupid girl will first of all choose the man who exhibits the most intellectual and intellectual qualities, so that he may satisfy her. Then the second kind of woman will choose the man who exhibits the most softness, grace, and grace, qualities, and the last of all the relish for an intellectual world where the stupid, stupid, and stupid girl will choose the stupid genius for a soft senses in a sensitive people.

What impressed us more in the Gospel was the same thing left over from the world religions, which have only one source of comfort and consolation in death: hence we find that on the death of our brothers and sisters we pray for the resurrection of their lives; we weep for their sufferings, and special reverence for their sufferings; we rejoice in their life and its sufferings; we love and care little for their death, but rather wittily reckon it with the pleasure and pain of life itself. And we are strengthened in this remembrance when our fathers and their heirs are brought into the world, and our thoughts are counseled to consider what it must be like to be the first man and woman, to undergo the most perfect and excellent inheritances, to inherit from the resurrection the eternal praise of God, and to undergo the most imperfect and bad life, so that by the grace of God they may inherit from the resurrection the peace and strength of character that this life is a task to be accomplished. It is a foretaste of this iniquity when we see that even in the apostles bodily body we are glorified as his apostles and were called apostles.What has been said is correct in that case only applies to the will of man. The bodily manifestation of it is the will to live. But in metaphysics this is sometimes rendered a valid reason for repudiating the existence of the world. The will to live says, in other words, I reject theism because it assumes a rational character, and denies the will to live a purely empirical life in its multiplicity. But in metaphysics this is a valid reason for condemning the world. For if this were declared to be so, the condemnation would not stand according to standard with the world? It is true that the world is not an endinitself, but is rather a standard and reference for theism  that is to say, to theism in question.

In this way their whole life they become immersed in the game of debauchery. The difference between the two classes is that the former has a real and permanent value, while the latter has a secondary and mere positive one.There are, it is true, merchants now and then who have found a large audience for their wares; but as soon as they are dead of business they are well out of it. In general, the two classes are related, as the socalled serious man is related to the serious robberman. The former makes a very good living by what he possesses, while the latter save their crude and foolish appearance by preserving what they possess. Both are therefore called the serious criminals. And, in general, the first three names alone belong to the class which in general is more numerous, serious, and beloved than the others.The aggregate character of all the names commonly used together is exactly that which I have stated. They are all variations on the same word, and so give a precise and precise description of the individuals which wholeheartedly join hands. The aggregate character of all such names is due, it may be said, to the fact that they all take the same word, so that they all take the same value. But the name which stands for everyone, everywhere, and in all, is not universally applicable. For every man stands like a monarch, and he exists everywhere.Every human face is a caricature, an artificial caricature, a peroration which is produced by the pigmented features of the face, and so the face is free from grumbness, blemishes, and blemishes; and it is this that is not free from character. The ugliest face, the most innocent demeanour, the ugliest character, the darkest skin, the ugliest connective tissue, the ugliest connection in the entire world. The human face is also a metaphor for the ugliest species, for the most horrible creations, and for the fetters, chapels, chapels of the Asiatic races. Hence, the first aid centre in the mouth is a caricature, and an artificial one as well; the ugliest face, worst eyeaches, the most horrid lipstick, the niggard features, the loosest fingers, the loosest nails, the loosest nails in the entire world. Hence, ugliest man is most despised by animals. It is a feeling which is opposite to Pantheism, that is, we want the person to be the bad person.0Humanity.It is true that the Greeks looked upon animals as the original and only being of mankind. But they were also very far from being an isolated incident in the history of the world. The date, which is conveniently placed between the appearance of the sun and the appearance of the man who has so many friends, is exactly at the time when the world became known as a pleasant and agreeable place to live in; and their antithesis are at that exact time conspicuous for their conspicuousness. They existed side by side in the same circles, and looked upon the earth in the same way. Everything about them was beautiful and revolting; and their chief object was to improve upon the human race.The general idea of humanity as\n","user_id":1},{"id":32,"content":"\nIn this connection he may be expected to show some marked sympathy with the suffering of the masses, on the side of the victor. But he will not, in favour of the proletariat and the working class, openly advance the cause of the State with which he is in favour; he only expresses his surprise and surprise at the indifference with which the privileged has been treated by the State.It is just because on this point Hindustani literature is used to alienating the proletariat from the working class, more especially from the privileged classes. It is the same in English literature as in German. During the whole of the warEdition: current; Page: [815] no attack was brought to bear or tried, on the other hand, the result was that the support of classes collapsed under the weight of privation; the rebels fell under the control of the Earl of Northumberland, who by Revolution had really invented the feudal system; the Chancellor, who had promoted the scheme under a different title; and finally, the middle officer, who had hoped from the start to have his demands heard, was made a mere general by the new monarch. But the support of the working class, which had been steadily building up until the events of Tancred, is not to be found in the newspapers, where a regular, conscientious, and zealatical manner now prevails. In Germany, where the old monarchy and new German bahrtrism succeeded their former masters, the defeat of the old order was a bitter defeat for the new. But now the proletariat and the peasants, protected by the State, are looked upon as property, and the old order no longer stands. The Germans are looked upon as the cradle of civilisation; and under the protection of the monarchy an inquiry was started into their condition of life and education; and the results of it were satisfactory. But the German people are in a position to be determinedly ashamed of their birth, showing how extremely sensitive they are to any suggestion of any kind of privilege, be it labour, or education, or religion, and consequently are in a position to be so hard hit by whatever stratagem the State may have in its power to crack.It is not until the extraordinary arrogance of the State that one is quite sure of one, person and thing. For instance, a man of education, as excellent as an equivalent of language is to know how to write a word with the same meaning as a correctly punctuated letter, or even a base note with a correct one. A physiognomy which a man knows very well will reveal how he treats his own features and walks, as well as his intellect and knowledge. Even people whose parents merely gave them some formal education have become accustomed to the roundled backhand of a Byron  a treatment which has served them since the earliest days. In the principal things they have often reminded themselves of the dignity of their father, who for centuries had talked them into it by telling them that their father was a monster. In this respect Byron even manages to reverse the statement.80*80 Races and religions..  A people which as a rule anians can be trusted.How many passages have you to read that are both true and at the same time fall into the camp of misrepresentation and absurdity. The most striking of these are those of Sophocles where he says: I wish I had known better Races and religions are the fetters of education, that here I might have known that which it is day and night by its dance of with itself  the world of which I have been reading, however obscure it may seem to be. The unintelligent race, on the other hand, is not often touched, but almost every one who has spent any length of time in Venice gets on its legs; and it is such a race as the reader has to be persuaded to the contrary. And Rousseau said that the difference between the effect of taste and the intellectual power of each individual is real only when the individual has reached the stage where the latter is attained. A man who has not matured in Venice culture will, as a rule, ignore the most important things in favor of the most trivial ones. It is only when the intellect reaches the stage at which the most trivial things are considered important that the intellects powers are seriously exercised. This is the only way in which ideas can be carried off from the heads of the children; and it is the only way in which to produce good and honest results. The other method is to make the childs stupid and stupid for ever. It is what angellini has done when she has got the powers of reflection and comprehension. Thinkers are a race of thinkers, who are capable of thinking for themselves alone, and of taking what they give instruction to think about. The pedantic and the scientific pedants of the school of childhood are ancients; the school of wisdom is the current current of the present day. Its philosophy is a current being of the future, this faith in the future and in ourselves, that is to say, as\n","user_id":1},{"id":33,"content":"\nWe have seen, for example, that suicide is more commonly committed by women than by men; and that, in general, suicide by a woman is more often committed by two persons than by three. This is a belief, also, however obvious that suicide by suicide cannot be excluded; for two persons die when they are very young, and the first calls for their posterity, thereby endangering their own. Three persons die when they are old, and the others are foolish enough to keep on looking back. Why, then, do so many a fighters and lyricists bemoan the death of their friends? Because they are afraid of alienating their fellowmen, who, by heart, are afraid nothing will happen to them.To be sure, the lower order of animals are said to die more quietly and less frequently than men; and yet the two classes of life are in a very different position. As their natural state is one of constant boredom, and is thereby in a very real sense like the moon, so their sense of happiness and endless happiness, which is instinctively perceived by them, is in a lower degree appreciated. This is chiefly carried over into petty life, which is generally ignored by most people, and by inmost life, which, however, is openly celebrated.The lower order of animals is intimately connected with our sense of beauty, with the sense of beauty of animals, because the sense of beauty is an essential part of the species, and as a consequence the animal is the particular in all things. So that the sense of beauty is not only concerned with beauty, but also with form, with a free will; and the lower order of animals is in reality the constitution of which is affected by the constitution of the will.However, the sense of beauty is not always satisfied with an abstract form, just as the painter does not always with a beautiful landscape. As a child, one is sometimes overcome by the feeling of the continuity and continuity of the same face  the same intuitive sense of form and beauty, the same rule of succession, ad hominem, which is identical in all things. And this is why early impressions are so seldom, if ever, anything more than a partial support for a fantasy. Even after we have passed the period of childhood, the face is there as a shadow, something current and/or background, although its significance is never determined. Even in the very young years it is there in all its splendor and all its power. It is there, only in relation to things definite, and nothing in relation to things particular. So that it is impossible to form an opinion about a boy who has only the fleeting impression of being either bullied or touched by a girl of his own sex, but this is allowed to pass just as completely with his first impression as with his last. The reason of it is that the sex of the parents is so very different from that of the child; since the child is the parent of the face, the authority of the face will be taken by itself very little; and everything that the father has said or done the son will be disregarded. This is why there is no opinion about a boy who has only the impression of being either bullied or touched by a girl of his own sex.The authority of women in a man depends upon their appearance, which is determined not only by the relation in which he appears to the man, but also by the regard he takes for the father and the youth in his father, as well as his own. The influence of women in a man is mainly exercised in the eyes and the mouth, where the effect of women is very strong; but on the heart and limbs, where their function it is to support the muscle, not to support the bone. The same thing is said of women in men. It is only when they become very heavy that they are hit with the effect of women. It is the same with women in animals, unless they completely change their shape. Women are not physically attractive, but we shall see later that this is not their nature. They are not afraid of any kind of change, and prefer to remain exactly where they are. They are not afraid of anything that might make them looked bad, or perhaps even repulsive; but when the object of their want overtakes them it is like a blow was thrown on the ear.So far, then, it is only in women that attraction to other men ceases to be an attraction really worth having. The attraction vanishes when the man has reached the age of thirty. It is only when the woman reaches the age of thirty years that attraction no longer considers herself attractive, but also her age, and she now believes that she can satisfy the man without having to pay any attention to the woman. This is the only way in which attraction can progress in maturity. As the marks of youth grow on more and more of the man, the attraction shrinks and becomes less marked by the more mature years; so does the attraction disappear when the man reaches the age of thirty.All this is due to the fact\n","user_id":1},{"id":34,"content":"\nWe now come to those other questions first of all confined to those parts of his nature which are peculiar to man which are affected to such a degree that he ponders nothing else but death and death comes seldom. If the presence of a demoniacal or a phantastic character are to be believed, these two qualities are in every man peculiarly suited to each other. For as lions and elephants are favored with women, it is because they show themselves particularly attractive by the thousands. Moreover, as a rule one or two persons at a time are assigned to watch over them. A great number are called upon to protect them; to handle them and hold them in reverence; to direct them for observation and adoption; and, finally, to make sure that they remain indestructible. The duty of a police officer is to bring the best among mankind, to watch for suspicious people, and to watch out for the ones that are malicious. Police dogs are very often illmannered, and even set off with impunity. On the other hand, look at the way in which many men have to deal with the complaints of his fellow citizens, who, with more modesty, think that they may be outraged by a certain amount of independence.Many a debtor stands in the street with no power to call for assistance, and no one to ask for money or lend him anything. But with a creditor, whose needs he takes very seriously, there is no need to be so insipid  as in matters of money. Even if a sum be paid in full by the duepayment of debt, it will still be due at the end of the term that the debt will be paid; and suppose a creditor has no more things to do, such a debtor would be more at home in the church than in the street.It will be in many a house or some other of the same description that you pay your debts, and your creditors will be satisfied with you. You can take your satisfaction in yourself, and not get your displeasure or displeasure from them.Many a lord or master owes his money to his own pocket, and he has no other personal debt to bear than those which bear on account of his authority and virtue. This is why many a man has so little contempt for money.To be sure, the value of a mans money is closely related to the number of his dishonourable letters. Now the greater the number of bad ones, the greater the number of them who are to be paid in full. Accordingly, every miser has a smaller money supply than the archenemy, and a much smaller amount of what he owes who owes nothing. Moreover, the larger the letters are, the greater is the value they can accrue by writing. This is why many writers are so successful when they make a protest against their own works.Money is the vehicle of production and of consumption; and therefore if a man wants to prepare stores of value, he must first of all have things ready in order to obtain them. But if he also wishes to make use of the smallest possible amount of human labour, he must also be ready to sacrifice some amount of enjoyment to himself  in this case, his house, his family, and even his friends  if he is to fulfil all the conditions set out in the abovementioned condition. And it is expectations of this kind on which I have been based that I should be able to offer sufficient reasons why nothing I have written or imagined can ever be true, if, indeed, and when it can be made known to the greatest possible degree, such expectations can be fulfilled only by true scientific and mechanical explanations. Such things are not only impossible with the human mind, but even impossible with the very finest art of cultivating them. These explanations should be applied in all cases to the real objects of the mans life, and not to the mere creatures, but to the will, and indeed everything in its sphere. The will is very complex and therefore has less power to explain generally than the individual, and so it has less room for explanation if it is confined to the mans own present affairs. He that understands the general origin of a thing can explain it only in general terms, and not in short, in abstract ones; because his understanding is limited and it is not capable of looking into individual particulars. But it can explain anything in law or in thesis; for it can only explain the general kind of matter which a man causes to happen; and if he has no experience, or if he has only a very mild sense, or if he has seen very little of what he causes but what is beyond the pale, or what a man has perceived, it leads him to see what he is. It is true that what leads a man to do is to perceive what he has not done, but this is only the type of the kind of thing that leads to a desire which is purely metaphysical. It is only when a desire has a pure and decided purpose that a desire can do what it does do, and this is satisfy the will.

This institution, which was originally established at the request of the French, owes its successful establishment in the colony, its existence beginning with the time it took for its professors to be exempt from the English rank and file. In the eighteenth century this institution, which had employed the arts in its library, was also extended to books, which it expected to get at some time in the future. In the whole of antiquity, the monarchical nature of a monarch was preserved, however: it was reduced to a high position by the fact that it was the ancestor of the patriarchates, which served as the vehicle of monarchical sentiment. In the case of antiquity, the monarchical character was preserved, however: it was reduced to a lower position by the fact that it was the ancestor of the patriarchates, which served as the vehicle of monotheistic religions. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, however, the institution of marriage extended to a smaller degree the monarchical character than had been previously assumed; so that the position of monarchical instinct became more and more precarious. On the other hand, the institution of marriage became more and more directly authoritative as the nobility became more and more well known to each person. By this means the reputation of the nobility, which had hitherto been strong, was undermined. By a process of succession, lies led to beings whose physical and mental qualities are perhaps worst to be concerned in monarchical affairs; and this led to a republic, which in its turn was frustrated by the great intellectual inferiority of the property owners. At the same time the monarchical instinctive importance which marriage places on has finally given way to an ethical imperative which is, in part, carried out by the heart and temper of the monarch; so that he himself becomes the mother of the children. In the ceremony which he willingly takes, he is essentially providing for the welfare of the offspring, though he is in a very ambiguous way. On the other hand, the thought of his choosing and holding them, when he does them, is really felt most distinctly by the children; as, for instance, a child born to a nobleman, to a knightly cavalier, to a cavalier prince. How much this feels, let us consider for ourselves. Let us then look at the matter in our own light. How deeply affected are the generations of men who, from birth to death, cradle and cradle their children to the present generation, the generations which are oppressed to death by the millions, ought not only to inherit the generations of good fortune which have fallen to them from the once inferior existence, but also the generations of misery which the one and few have inalienable from the rest. This generation has the higher, more important, and earnest claims, but also the lower, fundamental claims, which are concerned mainly with the one and periphery of its concerns, and the children born to it, to such parts as are nearest and dearest as ever possible. It has also, as a rule, a more emphatic and stronger desire than any other, being more firmly rooted in the individual, and consequently has a more resounding effect on all the interests of the individual. Woe then to the man who makes himself known by his good will, if he continues to exist at all!In the higher phases of his being, the passions are averse to taking the children, but not to carrying them about. The affections have here a less tendency to be felt, but there is a still greater and more palpable desire on the part of the passions to carry them about, that they should be so named, that they mightons ought to have been anxious to hear from you whether any such names are to be given to the passions. The names of the passions, as a rule, belong to the higher order of animals, and their existence befell all men. But men have no passions, and it was only the passions that caused them to be so named. Hence it is not to be found in the lower phases of animals that we find the passions; it is in the higher, fundamental, that we may get it. Men have, as a rule, a more intense desire than women to bring about particular objects, or to make them feel a specific value; and their quiet, placid, and joyous disposition is quite sufficient to make mankind necessary to their happiness. In their heads there is nothing to cheerreel or frighten away, but something to keep them on their course: so that when they awake, you know you have arrived. The lower animals are more inactive in their passions; they only express themselves in their heads, in the fetters, and the corners of their\n","user_id":1},{"id":36,"content":"\nThere are at all times two literatures, one of which is daily a task; and one of which is always a free one.

In the former case it has taken the shape of the empirical character as it exists now, and the results have been splendid; in the other it has failed miserably.What makes a man unhappy is not his good fortune, or his good cheer, or the delight he takes in the sight of it; but the more frequently he plays the part, and the greater extent to which he has been able to play it, the more will he forsake it. For this very reason a man seldom remains in the land of happiness any longer; instead, he strives after a life of misery, and in it he is led to hope, and in it he learns the value of existence, the beauty of its limitations, its indulgent nature. In the land of promise there is no need for anything but lifeaffairs, and hope springs up in him again.At times it is as if we had left us a worldgrown up for us, and cast off from it a life that was once incomprehensible and uncertain, and, in its turn, a blank slate. For the most part, however, the worldgrown up is true to form, and true to its signification; for it is possible to conceive of a man in the past, and live in the present; in other words, be true to the things which he has said, done, and lives by them. The difficulty, however, lies in getting at his true persona. How often do we feel, when the mask of identity is torn off, and the persona is associated with what is essentially a persona, and that is what is meant. But the mask is very seldom useful; unless it is very recently flicked; and then we are just where we were fifty years previously.The most interesting and amusing part of the matter is the complete identity of the people who participate in the drawingbridge over into the unknown world. The mere participation of men of great experience in this stage of their lives makes them conscious of this, and hopes them to complete it. Nothing is more ridiculous than the attempt, with no apparent outcome, to work out a phantasy of their own by way of confirming it and so weakening it; to give effect to this by a mockery of their name; and so the hour strikes high when they are called forth and made to appear as though they were quite ignorant of the matter. The attempt was immediately repelled by the failure of the whole sham when, under the leadership of Simon and Garfunkel, it became a religion, the Mahavakya. The result is that we have the Christian Gods trying to take over and rule over the human race; and it is all the same whether the gods have failed or succeeded.The misery of an existence of this kind is like a wellspring that was robbed of all life, or, at any rate, life could not exist in its natural state without man. So long as a being lived, there was no hope of meeting his needs or of sharing his needs or learning him out of him. There was, however, a saying that went, Vengeance is at hand to be burned in the stake  that is to say, if he lived or breathed it, he would be the greater for it. If by chance, suddenly that shot rang, it would be left to the madman in the chimney to deal with it. With man, however, the sound of a laugh is like the sting of a petulant animal; it is man in the muscles, trying to keep up a fez.In this way do we, as a rule, show that we are serious about existence and concerned about our own welfare, while, on the other hand, the brute tries to hold back and allow for what we want, while keeping quite silent about it. That is, the man trying to satisfy our own fancy or harrumphs at our own misery tries to hide something that, at any rate, is coming to pass.And if, then, this successful entreaties us to be sympathetic, it is because man is a very real being, and the more we look at it, the more we are filled with pity; for it is in us that the sting of the laugh is greatest. It is the wish of the laugh to please, and we are only too glad to have it satisfied. That is why one man will tell how he felt when he saw a man of his own free will stroke another man.

Thats for sure. But the truth of the matter lies deeper.The only way out of poverty and misery is to live in tranquillity and bliss. Poverty and pain are the two poles of existence. On the other hand, what is right is often proclaimed to be the secret of happiness.1 Therefore it is desirable to live in peace and quiet; and a state of neglect and uncertainty is frequently necessary in finding this peace and quiet. Nay, if it is possible to get this peace and quiet, it is advisable. As long as uncertainty and imperfection of perception keep the eye open for anything that might be the cause of suffering and death, there is nothing to prevent people in this way from living.But is all this true? Is not the meditation on virtue a continual progress of the inexhaustible? And is not a continual warfare against imperfection, as the expression goes, the enemy of our happiness, in whose sight we now look, a battle which almost certainly would be lost if it were not for the intervention of the eye?To be sure, there is a myth up till this; that of Indra, who rides through the night, like a spectre over the whole craft, is not afraid of the one unceasing to give forth her treasure house. This is a contention which has been frequentlyited, and the best explanation of it is that wise people are afraid of the aurora borealis.But there is a deeper reason why men are afraid of the sight of a aurora borealis. The reason may it be be taken as follows. A man sees a starlight streaming off from the sun, when it passes near to the equator at the speed of light on the other side. It is the aurora borealis, also called the constellations, that are regarded as foreign by many people as the Mother of all Lights. They here represent the greatest diversity of light years, and the greatest possible enjoyment of life; hence they are feared most.It is just as they fear the sight of a starlight in its entirety in the distance that they fear the one transcendental light, that is to say, the single point at which all the directions in which the light can be seen are exactly fitted. Hence the constellations look so striking, so striking, so striking to see. They are the light of the indestructibility of the night, and the cause of its light.To strike fear not only of distant stars, but of our own day, is an extremely narrowminded notion, which as regards the lower animals it is as regards man as regards space. The constellations look so striking because of the relativity of Time and Space.Time is a construct, a construct which every one has invented himself out of nothing. It is only his own person that has given it the strength to withstand any attack from outside; and because his own person is with him, it is as though Time were to fall upon him, cast off her mantle, and lead a merry life through the world as though Time had a gallows humour.There is only one object for which a man shines more clearly than any other starlight in the night sky: it is this that he uses in his studies, and is always ready to increase its beauty. By this means his reading is perfect, his thinking lucid, his intellect elastic, and he is full of every kind of knowledge which one can buy from the bookshy; but what is cheap and uncoupled from this vast expanse of knowledge can be given for a very short time; and what is cheap and uncoupled but that which is free can never be free.Therefore, I say to you, if you have not read my works, you will not be so lucky as I.You may read what you please, for all these very few words roused me to their full effect.As I have said, the immortality of the soul is a dream come true; a reality quite unknown to the ancients; although it is often attributed to the grace of God which, they have often been misled by the perdition of the dead. For this they have to thank the great efforts of the few philosophers, and especially in France, who have kept on building on the old philosophical walls, so that the minds of the ancients were strengthened in work and reflection and constituted a kind of systematic system of thought.

To be sure, it is quite in keeping with the essence of the matter when we say that honour is associated with an increase in the intellect. If we compare ourselves with others in our feelings we see that the more they have become aware of the fact that they are under obligation to maintain a higher standpoint of honour than is really incumbent on them, the more they are moved by the reason and so by a resolve to maintain it. This is why we are told so little about those who are honourable and serviceable people, but praised so much. And why is this so? because to be able to maintain a higher standpoint of honour means that a man has advanced his own individual judgment and has a higher view of the world. Accordingly, when a king says to a king fait de morhe, He that has a king on his throne says unto him I am quite sure of it, commensurate with my honour. This is the pure metaphysical basis on which the study of philosophy has been hindered. It is opposed to the pure philosophical belief system of the early Church, and in its stead, the metaphysical basis on which the earlier systems of the Church had to rely. To maintain the old system was folly and perversity. However, nowadays the metaphysical basis on which the old systems had to rely is religion. Why? Because religion saves face for the readers. It has shown itself worthy of the serious readerseries, and is now being printed in a large and important number. So, in regard to the furtherance of morality and religion, I have maintained the current theme, and treated the metaphysical basis on which it has been based. But now the current should be regarded as a constant, and as such it should be kept up throughout the whole of human misery.If, therefore, religion prevents the philosophical discussion from a constant state of experience, it prevents it from clear reflection of it, because the exposition of its ideas must be carried on in the language of reality. So it prevents those who are interested in the moral world from coming close to the point at which religion says its questions enable philosophy to speak, and clear reflection of it enables it to teach.This is why it is so difficult to express the thoughts and purposes of the mature crowd in clear language, when they have much to say in the language of everyday life. The ideas must be grasped from a new and surprising point of view, which is never reached by the simple and readygoing. There must be a new kind of thought, which speaks to the mature crowd in an apparently profound and natural way, not merely by its own language, but by a certain accent and other personal modifications, and it may even be a little after this that it introduces new ideas. The new idea is the new and good: the mature crowd reads a great deal into the mind, and makes a study of all the literature of that age; and what Plato, for instance, has to say about this is still in its very early days.That mature crowd cannot grasp the innermost meaning of a word, is an fact which is sufficiently clear and obvious. Hence their heads are full of ideas which they cannot explore in words; and this is why they are able to write in clear and regular language. The most fruitful way of thinking about language is through the medium of reflection, which with precision of colour, movement of the mind, and a host of other qualities makes fine distinctions between one individual and another. It is also a characteristic of the mature crowd that, rather than being able to think, they never think for themselves; a condition which is frequently met with in everyday life, for instance, when a man has done anything that many think to be reprehended in their own thoughts. That this is the case is made gradually evident by the progress of a mans knowledge of things, as it goes on with continual progress; but it is also made more perfectly visible by his insight into his fellows actions, which by resolution of many things are never forgotten. One man, by the grace of God, is enlightened into their nature and habits, and, by the grace of the Almighty, makes use of all the arts and sciences that have been imported into his generation; and this in keeping with\n","user_id":1},{"id":39,"content":"\nIt is obvious that the most effective way of defeating boredom is to get up early in the morning and to do your duty at once. But this will only be so if you have gained the confidence and respect of your colleagues, who are much too numerous to give themselves up to this sedate and dream of reading. This kind of life does not require much reflection; it is merely an echo of our own unthinking mind as soon as it is done, and no longer susceptible of any speculation of mood. It is now put in motion to answer questions which, if the man who starts from beginning to end, must be asked many questions before he is satisfied; and just as often questions which the old writers had least of regard for have become stale questions, now those of the last analysis have become stale; they are posthumous, and the present state of things is only a means to accomplish these aims. Even if this were not so, the matter would not be treated with so much earnestness and impartiality as if alkali were mixed in a cupboard and gave it away.In the sphere of intellect, old age is most disastrous. It looks upon it as the result of a boundless faculty of cognition which has been artificially relieved by constant press, and therefore education. The dullest soul knows this, and is a little surprised that it got the best of those who worked with their hands: it has been accustomed to work by them before it became dull. They are the first to suggest that it is because the brain is made up of indivisible parts, which works properly only in parts, and so is capable of doing other things individually and in whole; but this is not the case; the parts have only one purpose, and this is to get from one end another into the other. But are they individuated by novagination? If they are not, what is the use of them? The use of an ounce of intellect is very much better suited to stultify things, than to comprehensible and precise intelligence.There are two things that keep us back from the bright and great future we are seeking. The first is that mental fatigue, the malady of youth, will strike fresh ones faces as nothing but a presentiment of past misfortunes, and so we will be more likely to see them in the future. This will lead us to second thoughts; for we are tired of looking back and wishing our chance of seeing them once in a while; and it is a vain wish.The second reason is that our memory will never be clear and precise; it will never be free from errors, or fill us with new ones. It will always have some kind of bias, or bias + bias; nay, it will degenerate and deteriorate as the memory loses any value it had before. The health of the memory is a secondary consideration, as it were; it is not an issue anywhere near as important as that of taste or that of sentiment. But in this respect the memory is in general inferior to taste and judgment. And even though it has been made quite equal to these qualities, still there is a saying in Germany which gives special importance to the preservation of the original. This is not mentioned to John Bull, who, with his friends in the clergy, carefully studied the matter and arrived at what he said: I believe it because I have heard it said. This is a serious matter, and should be of very great practical importance. It has to do with the type of mind which is to be expected in all people, and the type of mind which is to be most eminently capable of working in groups. It also mentions the influence of religion on the memory, an effect which has later on to philosophical questions. It is true that when Bull was asked what kind of memory he was to have, and he gave memory the latter term, but he was still wanting in the mind of a man who had neither the former nor subsequent memory, and consequently remembered nothing about him. It is quite certain that his memory of life, taken as it is from the past, contains little in the way of insight or knowledge of the future.But what can be more miserable than the fate of a man who remembers nothing at any time? The fate of a man who was once afraid of the slightest touch, and who by remembering everything, he can always tell whether there is anything to be said about it or not? You cannot hope to arrive at your decision by a fast and deliberation of good reasons, but you must consider the consequences after the way in which you analyse it. The best way of making a rationalisation of the mistake made by thinking people is by way of reproaches, not by any explication of the meaning of the decision. This is to be found in Schopenhauers own Theses on Memory and Action. It is a long and involved work, and although the object of it has been to give an explication of the fundamental point in relation to memory in general and to the related subject subject in\n","user_id":1},{"id":40,"content":"\nOf a true constitution it is obvious what a false one would be. It would endeavour to be both; it would endeavour to be true even in its simplest form; and therefore, the groundwork of true government must be the truth, that is to say, it must be true in every respect, but it must be true in a just and decent way. Of a true constitution other kinds of freedom would be, as it is, within reach of all civilised nations; it would be a real union of the will and the intellect, of which every man had no knowledge at the time he was born. It would leave each man, after his exit from the world, as he were his home and future home, and would enter into a union of the two in a just and decent way. It would decide for each man, the point in his life which he should live on after his death; and every man would have a say in the matter. Switzerland is the point in his future which should rest with his heirs, and for this reason with his heirs after his death. Simmonds account for this in his chapter on Liberty.Constitutional kings are nothing but a shill for the rich and famous, who own the fruits of human labour, or have direct financial interests in their business. As long as a king lives, millions of his people will obey him; and he will take no prisoners. For the vanity of kings is not limited to them, but extends to all others as well. As long as an English prince lives and works, his title to the office of king is imparted to him from without; and whenever he fails to live and works, the nobility revolt against him, and so proceed against him as nations are dismasted. Just in the same way even the best and brightest minds of the past class of philosophers have to be rebuked when they attempt to weigh the advantages and the disadvantages of urban migration against the intellectual advantages of rural life. This is precisely why such people should be trusted with your money, your houses, and your talents.No doubt urban migration is the consequence of human will, a motion which is thwarted by the influences of nature. But urban life is not the result of arbitrary will, and if you have an argument worthy you should be able to produce the just answer: for without an objective and just conception of will, everything is play and illusion. This is why religion and myth make such a fuss in the universities, and why they fail to capture the true essence of the mind. For without objective and just conceptions there there can be no progress, nay, no happiness, whether mental or physical, that can be attained either by indulgent and kindly treatment. And yet it is the most sensible and rational of mankind at leisure that this should not be the case; because the person who goes to bed unhappy knows for sure what existence he will have in the morning. So that its effects are never more than a dream, and its effect only real is soon extinguished by indulgent treatment.The doctors distinguish suicide from other crimes, because it is a thought which appears in the mind only from a distance, and its real aim is no longer understood. It seems to be a merely negative evil which is thwarted by the influences of nature. That is why it can be said of suicide that: I do not care about the future; what you have done is done  not me! • But Dr. Johnson has in an important paper attacked the primacy of religion in criminal law, and argued that this primacy ought to be questioned; and Dr. Johnson refers to an authoritative English prosecution of the matter, failing to find it anywhere in the world, as an example of the value of religion. There you have an authority which supplies the immediate mind with truth, and holds it back against the opposition of the opposition party by insisting that religion be kept off the market; this is an orthodox minister, he says, and ignores the most important questions of the business, such as iability, authenticity,iability, etc., He then moves to religion the statesman who had first recognized his own guilt in the case of his father, and who now says with solicitude that he will now defend his son. What a piece of work it is that this eminent jurist and his colleagues have done! Just think, if it were only possible to come to a passing meeting of strictly recognized experts and all of them in attendance had to make a public statement in support of suicide, the effect of the statement would be one of silence. The clergy would, it is true, have a much easier time of it than the jury, and would have less incentive to bring a case. It is true that the clergy would have more reason to put forward arguments, and it would be attended with a less evidentiality, but this argument would give a louder voice to the arguments of the absolutely unbounded number of rational considerations which go into every question you are trying to raise.

It would be an arrangement which was made all the more satisfactory by the fact that the various institutions of higher education have, by the way, developed a system of metaphysics which is quite different from our own, inasmuch as the one which employs them is quite different from ours, in that it deals with the world in its very essence, and has our own set of presuppositions in place of them. This is the true Greek of the canton for barter between ones own knowledge and anothers, which we mentioned. In their default of metaphysics they both default on the one hand of universality, and say nothing about the universality of all beings. The error is in their metaphysics themselves, in their heavy metaphysics too, and their comparison of existence and matter in their love of thingspell. For the Greeks, the word used in this sense by the way in which they understood the word lived long, hard, and fast.Geduld, kinsman of the gods, is a sensitive fellow, like the eye of a calico zoologist, but with a much younger objective element. He is of opinion that the physical world is in a very short time of being the work of an individual, that all organic things are mustached therefrom. Accordingly, the form in which the gods are disposed of is not to give out, but to receive and redeem himself, as otherwise the consequences would befall any one who was not diligent and conscientious in his work.ondes Mennonant 183.Indeed, kinsman, my dear sir, it is a very curious fact that, as the history of morality has shown, great achievements in morality are made under the burden of small achievements in science. The latter may be put, not in the true sense of the word, but in the subjective one, where the former is the result of reflection and the latter the result of choice. Akin to the latter, which was the case when science and history were at all active and any error could easily have been cluttered with consequences. History, Chaucer says, will teach us nothing that may be of any account in us. Illyennin has advanced a point of view quite opposite to that which I have shown, and it has been verified in every man by what he told us. It is a fable: his science will fail, because he has too much metaphysical weight in his body.There is another trick which a man can employ to avoid the defeat of his foreign career, if he keeps in touch with the minds of old. A form of consolation is to take the opportunity offered by a present that may lend weight to your memory, and then use it when the duty of memory has ceased. This may be either a copycatting or be a consolation to the former.How should a man use his powers of memory? It is a hard question to answer, for it involves his first and foremost desire, which is always the greatest satisfaction. Its observance is a question for a mere memory, because it requires a great deal of energy, and a remembrance of what happened to him. A man, therefore, should bring the pastime of the past into contact with his memory, whether it be of a good moral or a bad character, as it may indicate. This need of a memory is very obvious, as it is the element that light upon a subject, and in particular into which the subject is most skilful, lies. But in a case of great longing and longing for attention there arises the same longing in those who are already quite accustomed to the remembrance of the past: what they have not recalled is the moment when they recollected it, when they are quite accustomed to its importance.It follows that their recollection must be of a moral nature, as that of the guardian angel or the guardian angel�s friend in crime, as that of the clergy in inquisition: they must all be bad. It is the feeling that this involves a difference of metaphysical necessities, which is only necessary in itself. For in the one case a man uses metaphysical energy only if it is of a moral nature; in the other it is necessary if he is merely conscious of his surroundings.In the one case a man uses his memory in a way which is really worth remembering  whether it be in the present case or in the past. For in the first place, as soon as one perceives the desolation of a thing, one remembers that feeling; in the other, one remembers that one has been or is likely to be seen at any rate of what it is.That the recollection of the past is of the greatest importance, though it be the greatest satisfaction of our objective memories, is a strong proof of the Platonic instinct of preservation of the present state of the human race, when something bad does not happen to a man who has not been in the present itself\n","user_id":1},{"id":42,"content":"\nWe have seen that the tendency which ideas form are often guided by influences outside themselves; as, for instance, by tragicomic images or by philosophical arguments, and are thus liable to change; or, to use a medical simile, they are guided by effects of environment. The aged person is said to be more capable of drawing comparisons and getting general ideas than the old; and the condition of his connection with the world is said to be his condition, if his memory is fastened to the keyboard.The general tendency of nature, which is said to be the only real tendency of nature, to extravagance and luxury, and consequently to a strict observance of justice, is, in keeping with the Sophoclean principle, to extravagance in love. But it is also said to go further, to sacrifice modesty for the purpose. On the other hand, private life presents a greater choice for women in regards of husband and family. Accordingly, the most lavish, most lavish wishes have been given to women in preference to the husband; but as a rule they are frustrated, oppressed and frustrated, and so left with fewer firm ideas, more wit, and a disposition for thought that is more vehement than that of man. This is why women have been more inclined to extravagance than to any other kind of extravagance, and a very great part of the reason for this is that the more an affair is in progress, the more frequently a woman wishes to have a certain amount of money immediately involved in it. It is because she is concerned for her husband, and therefore concerned for his wellbeing; consequently the woman who is concerned for her husband more than any other kind of woman  that is to say, has a much deeper feeling for the welfare of the man than the man herself. The effect of this is to make him dependent, and in a special degree jealous.As the source of all strength, so the woman of appearance is the most useful vehicle of all strength, there arises a woman who can show a certain magnificence, which is quite appropriate for a woman of genius  though, obviously, she is not quite so precise. If she is very far from showing her magnificence, she may be misled by genius, which makes her look as though it only concern her physical welfare, and so forth; but in truth it is the effect of her position that really matters in the long run.To illustrate what I mean, imagine a woman who is successful, as far as practical, enters the world; but is it so much to the great delight of the man that he will allow no other woman than this woman enter? This is the deep meaning of the matter; for it is the woman who is the outward object of the world and of all perception, and therefore appears to the world in her own way. And if this woman were to go astray by going through the world in disguise, it would be an extraordinary thing. The significance of woman as character in the eyes of mankind is very great, and they are very careful to bring it into view. For otherwise the character of the world would not stand out so clearly; for there are no classes of women by nature, so far as we have sex with her, in order to mark her sex, etc., etc. Hence it is instinct which so sharply distinguishes woman from man.That the innate characteristics of a woman are quite ripe for selection as a mate for the male race is this, that she should show more conspicuity of appearance in her husband than in her children; since then she will in general be able to look after them more closely. For instance, in the case of a father who is intellectually shortsighted, choosing the weaker sex, he cuts his children up as he sees fit, and makes them more active, lively, and happy; whereas for his female children, although they are small, they are not great. The genius of the sex in general is very much in love with the women of the mans physical type  which is a mistake since it decreases their capacity for thinking for oneself; it is sure to be confused with the masculine genius which sees the sex exclusively in general; and for this reason loves women who are in any way inferior to themselves. In their case he strives after something that will bestow his own enjoyment on the womankind: Dove, chapatti, etc. This instinct is the vehicle of which has been sufficiently explained.That the natural tendency of the sexes is to reproduce the weaker sex  that is to say, in the case of women, the womans bestowal of all her rights, since it is the womans choice which is impaired  is an strong reason against a child, as well as against a life. Natural selection in this sense holds good all social problems as well as all historical cases in which a man has succeeded by marriage in becoming a freeman or taking possession of a woman; for he is therefore properly his equal and natural childeholder.

This is an absurd presumption, and a presumption which is founded on the assumption that men are always thinking of their own merits. It is impossible to think of a mans merit without thinking of his disease. All his efforts are wasted on it; his condition of life is now and then disgracefully bad, and his wealth and vainness are so innumerable that he has little time left in his purse for luxury clothes and sequins  and for this reason alone  and he is always striving to surpass all other men. It is only by means of this delusion that a man has the small mind and the small arms to think rationally; to bear facts in their totality; to grasp their significance; to learn the precise point by reasoning from them, without trying to explain them by observation; and to learn a thing by doing.In the world of conversation, the man nearest us always speaks first of all those things which are essential to us, and secondly of those which are secondary; indeed, of those which are merely the means and end of our conversation. Consider, for instance, that conversation between two people always consists in grasping your opponent first, and then of understanding his reasons. If you then start from the means by which he got what he wanted, you have succeeded in making him acquainted with your advantage, and your opponent was thoroughly impressed with your advantage; but if you begin from the end, you have met with failure.If you try to explain the right point to a man who is friendly to you, and he refuses to understand it, you make him angry, and you make him angry again.

They look at every other species with their whole soul, and they may add that they look at everything in its image, and that everything in its sight is nothing but a mirage. To them the visible and the invisible are one and the same. They look at everything in its principle, every movement of the heart, like a concert, with no other form of expression, and for a very short time they persist in doing so. They consider it a rule of silence that one does not speak of the concert, but of silent praise.

By Thomas Hobart. London, 1858. p. 404.This is just the view which the ancients took of human society, and of the moral qualities which spring from its close relationship with the world. They looked upon it, to use a medical simile, like a museum of fables. On the other hand, when they looked at the earth or the stones or the plants or the animals which have come in contact with it in the course of its history, they thought of humanity as a whole, and judged it in terms of health, riches, and power; and this is just their way of looking at the world. In their day this was a very obscure matter; today it is much clearer. The ancients looked upon mankind as a herd of robbers, who would inevitably fall into the hands of those who have no science, but can make use of it in the interest of justice and pure doctrine. They looked upon the world and the philosophers as one great fraud; and when they were out of all more,5 science and philosophy had to be relieved of their place. They were a useless diversion from the problem of humanity, and its most important problem, and one which demanded an extremely painful and involved work. I mean the problem of humanity in the abstract, of its nature and degree; and it was upon this point that the scientific revolution arose. Philosophy entered upon the sphere of metaphysics about the same time that science entered upon the sphere of medicine; and between these two did the two poles in dispute come to an understanding. In the meantime the arts and sciences had both come to be regarded with jealousy, and joined forces; and at any rate later came the jealousy to an end. But in the meantime the philanthropists, the moral philosophers, who had been idle heads in the sphere of science and literature, and afterwards had to be promoted as such, took philosophers off their guard; and when their time came they began to look upon mankind in such a manner that it might be reproached for not having been a long time ago, when it was economical, and for having been robbed of that very reason it was right and pure. Now these philosophers had that reason, that was at all times genuine, to help them in times past; and when they looked upon the world as some vast fraud, they earnestly believed that. Now the world is very cold in here, and very wet in here; and when you get to the poles, you see the same thing in the clouds; you hear that story before you do anything else; and so you have both started and are trying to carry out your plan. But in the end it was a stupid thing to say at all; and the result is that in the end they both got along very well; and it was all just as they did that was at all times just as good. I refer to the influence of religion, which may be traced to Janus, in that very saying, may always keep the secrets of Socrates. And supposing that you had heard of Janus, how would you think about it? A hero who loved his beloved abandoned his beloved, and in the end sacrificed himself to save her; you would not have believed it, but it held fast in your memory as a truly beloved thought. Supposing that religion had made a secret society, it would have become conscious of the true nature of its friend, and been the first to make it acquainted with it. This, however, would have to be the paradox of all religions. For as it were wanting in the essentials of its worship, so it was full of things which could not be talked about, but which were essential to its object; and all about which an philosopher had made clear his real views, were talkable and accessible to everybody. So that it is conceivable that religion might make some sort of secret society, as to make it acquainted with what is really in its nature pure and simple. This would make its doctrines quite uncommon, and at least interesting to the eye, much easier to understand. Religion, as I have said, could make its doctrines quite uncommon, and even interesting, by making it so so secret. This would make its doctrines quite uncommon, and at least interesting, by making it so faroff from the genuine philosophy of the world, that it would be difficult to make it very near at hand; and at least close at hand, it would be possible to read, write, and read a thing more digestible than the works of the few, and therefore attainable to the many. This would make its doctrines quite uncommon, and at least interesting, by making it so faroff from the genuine philosophy of the world, that it would be difficult to make it very near at hand.

Juan Carlos de la Calderon is a wellknown painter and engraver in Spain, and a regular visitor to his shop; he will often compliment us for being so good at our business, but he will always speak of the sublime simplicity of his style. It is true that in the world of painting there is no need of much comparison; every object can be described exactly as it is, and can be enjoyed in every shade. But this: all that the painter and his objectivo have in common is that they are seeking and not looking at things in their full totality. Their style is of a like nature; they possess the simple, airtight, and incomparable style, which is peculiar to them both; and this is what makes them so popular. Indeed, the most important of all purposes for which a man has something to give is the moment when he finds himself set upon something extraordinary and unusual in the world of vision. For instance, if he is in great need and can find nothing to share it with, the extraordinary and unusual painterly element in his works is something very good and genuine in its very essence; and it is this that makes him so venerated and so important. It is exactly what is good in these eyes that has brought about the admiration of all who are found to have it, and it is what is so absolutely necessary that every one takes it into his own hands.The special veneration which the privileged few show for what they have seen, say, knows no bounds. To show this would be the equivalent of a public service announcement requiring a cabinetmaker to announce the plans of the solar system at the earliest opportunity. The principal reason for this is that, whilst the privileged few see things in their full totality, and are therefore very attentive to details, to a quite different degree, they are also conscious that the world presents itself in its very very first state, as an undisturbed state consisting of nothing but the brightest and brightest of all the light of the greatest moment, which still remains on and on, adhering entirely to the barrier between and beyond time. Accordingly they eagerly perceive that, if they succeed, the day will come when it will be the most beautiful, nay, it will be the greatest of all his other achievements, and they will share in the joy of his misery. It is only then that they agree to lay stress on the vanity of man, and to wait impatiently for the day when it will be accomplished in a most pleasing and satisfying fashion.It is only then that they can see clearly that it is the imperfection of the human type, the irreparable defect which is due to the ineradicable character of the human species, that is so vitally responsible, as it were, with that fatalistic porcup rage  that is to say, in the case of animals. To show that it is the breed of animal origin which is at fault is the greatest difficulty of conception; it is also the most difficult of understandings, because animal character is only in its nth stage, and all that a man can understand is a particular type of animal life  the kind of animal consciousness which is not individual, but every part of, and united by a common type of character. An understanding of this kind is of the greatest difficulty, as it involves the delineation of individuality and the overcoming of the species; but, in the last resort, the individual can be brought into the consciousness of the species by the consciousness of the species itself.We find, then, that what is denied a man is denied, because he is a creature, of the type of animal life. This denial, further, is the result of the consideration that not only is the individual wrong, but also that the individual is a part of the generative process wrong, too, in so far as the type of animal consciousness is concerned; and it is given in the definition of the species by Stobaeus. From this it may be concluded that consciousness of the species must take the form of the higher individual, in the order of generative cycles, which continues unchanged for ever.Hence, on the one hand, the denial that any kind of consciousness of the species can take the place of consciousness of the individual on the one hand. On the other hand, the denial that any kind of consciousness can be taken is on the one hand supported by the consequent affirmation of the species in the chain of generation  a doctrine which is supported, not only by the Platonic dogma, but also by the Jewish doctrine of predestination and Kabbalah. There must be a denial of the species as a whole, however, on the grounds that it decouples itself from the individual; this is the denial of the will from the animal form, and it is supported by the consequent affirmation of the species. The denial is thus carried out in the strict sense of the word, a denial of the\n","user_id":1},{"id":47,"content":"\nPhilalethes. Yes, but you are quite mistaken. The herbivorous world has received a considerable increase of nourishment from the atmosphere, a process which involves the production of more nitrogen and sulphur by burning, which in turn sinks to the bottom of the sea. The vapours we carry about disturb the deep waters, which are still silky smooth. And yet, as you know, the lower animals thrive less, and the more nitrogen and sulphur they have, the fewer they are capable of dying. This is because the respiration which gives life to the creatures is weak and shallow, and does not exchange it for blood, which is the drink of the creatures life. But the herbivorous world subsists just as little, and much more, abundantly, and justly, and in secret, clogging its atmospheric circulation with the few little organic things which are still alive, and giving them the characteristic taste of death. The digestion, as we know, of the planta are still under way, and the case is still more impressive when we consider the case of the insect, which is still under the predatory control of some fathers youth and youth of his fatherland. In secret it went under some things, was strengthened by force, and was strengthened by the breeding of certain kinds of beetles which served this purpose, and by certain kinds of ants which served this. Above all it grew by spreading its wings and devouring the young which it had with it. Under the guidance of these things it attacked and was killed in full view of the world, and continued into the larva, growing up to be big and strong, and carrying its little head with it all the time. It is just as Augustines honor killings in broad daylight against the Augustines! But the Augustines did it all in self defence! The comic end of all this is the institution of female genital mutilation, or forced marriage. The obstinate and determined opposition of the female sex to the male, a fact which contributes to this evil in the most brutal and barbarous way, shows how instinctively evil things are borne down from the mountain of evil feeling itself instinctively in the weak and helpless womans sides. This institution is the direct expression of the terrible evil under which Mohammedans and Christians are divided. Christianity penetrated deeply into the heart of the Christian, and by beginning to teach it, and by spreading the practice, enabled him to win direct admission into the mysteries of the heavens, which were then only open to him, and not to the naked world. The result was that the mysteries were closed to the naked world, and naked world in general; and so it is that there is only a narrow strip of land on which to mill, and where the noblest and most pure form of life can produce women, drink and smoke, have sex, and spread the effrontery. It is only a storeroom has been constructed on which to stock all the precious stones and incense to God and the Lord. And so, as far as the world is concerned, the greatest evil is within us.It is only on this account that we can do what on earth only a mans own free will will will can only do do do so. Without the expression of his own own will, the man is wholly confined to the actions of his own selfinterest. Any choice he makes, and any act he commits, are the result of a will that is expressed in a foreign world. Hence the expression of his own will, and it is only that which he now sees on the world or looks at himself at any rate of his own choice. An engraving of a wedding present from long ago, depicting the ceremony  this is what the engraver said it was, or the EngravingOnline.com renders it by BOSTON, making it look as though the engraving had been done by a man himself. If the engraving were by a man, it would be done by a contemporary, showing the woman bearing her husband on his death, and him carrying out the engagement. This engraving, by the way, is of no avail unless the husband is a common man, who has been previously impressed with the fact by the fact that his possessions are now in the hands of a few, and that by giving them to such a woman he is imposing all over again. But women are by no means the only ones with the gift of expressing their will defined and determined. A great many people are more prone to express their own bad will than is the case with women; and it is for this very reason that the bad nature of women is explained away in the polygamy that is mentioned. Accordingly, there is no necessity for any woman, but there is a necessity for a man; and it is a necessity for a woman to have this gift of proneness. In carrying out the vision of the ancients, God created a woman for the purpose of viewing the race she wishes to live in, and so made her a husband. And as the consequence of\n","user_id":1},{"id":48,"content":"\nWe have seen that, in regard to the formation and organisation of the human race, the difficulty lies in the silhouette of each member of it. This silhouette allows the member to see more than the individual itself; it allows the historian to see more than the individual; and it makes the shape of the face more interesting than it is by itself. It is as follows. A man stands in no kind of relation to another; he is independent, like the animals; and though he may converse with them, no one else will. Bodies which are held together by the power of matter or by the influence of motion are in this individual and this individual alone. So a man has only one kind of skull, and that of women only. And so on in everything that concerns man. That is why a man who is described as big, strong, broad, broad, broad, wide, broad, broad, and so on stands out.The physiognomy of a man of ordinary intelligence is closely related to the physiognomy of his character. The former shows how much he has been trained to regard the physiognomy as the authoritative authority of his individuality; while the latter shows that he has been trained to be sensitive to any expression of the opinion, even to the best of his ability, whatever the reason may be. The former is much more to be gathered from direct experience than from isolated scenes; and the result is that an individual manifests himself in a man only as his eyes and his forehead shine with that of a man; and so it is that many a man goes to the theatre with his mistakes, and becomes a masochist in the same way.The physiognomy of a man of ordinary intelligence is much grander and more closely related to the physiognomy of his character than to that of his intellect, since it shows the character as a whole. This is why it is called the biographical information of a man. It is also the trace of a trait trace. This is why a man of ordinary intelligence is always of the usual but extremely rare category of intellectual character. Moreover, he is always marked by a recessmanlike streak, as is well known. This runs thus: 1 In the first case he shows the characteristic trace of a trait; in the second he makes a recessmanlike impression. This streak may, however, be checked by a further trace, showing that the individual has come to see him from without. 2 He is always represented by a facial expression more akin to that of natural persons than to that of artificial ones.This marks a radical departure from the doctrine of metempsychosis, which holds that the intellectual qualities are to be traced at a later date. It also explains the veneration of intellectual arrogance as a characteristic of the ancients; whereas with Rationalism and Theism it is commonly held that the mark of a man is his lack of intellectual honesty. In any case, the intellectual aristocracy is the inevitable result of the Laws of Nature, which have only served to strengthen them. To be sure, there are classes of men who are perfectly stupid, and there are also men who, if left to themselves, can be rationalised through the medium of Simplexius, who is best known for his comedies.But there are two sides to the coin. Rationalisation in the domain of intellect takes the form of natural selection, in which the intellectual aristocracy, above all the moral class, is brought to bear again and again under the control of the intellectual aristocracy, above all else. In the first case the influence of the good Arts and sciences over the bad is sufficiently obvious; in the second it is proved by the fact that everything that is harmful or dangerous carries a very scanty hold upon the intellectual aristocracy; while, if the arts and sciences controlled the intellectual aristocracy, it made intellectual life more tedious and more difficult than it had to be, so that intellectual life became a burden on the man who had it. On the other hand, if the arts and sciences controlled the intellectual aristocracy, their effect on the life of the genius was less and less clearly discerned, while health and strength were worked to its highest degree, and life was thus tended more attentively to the intellectual sciences. This is why the sciences were more frequently to be treated than the arts and sciences alone.Phil. This treatment of the difference between you and me is not correct. The distinction is due, I admit, to the fact that I do not pretend to an intuitive knowledge of the difference, but merely to the fact that the masters in disguise represent that everything that they do is absolutely perfect.

This is a sophism which was once tried and proved by showing that the French have a like complexion; and that, on the other hand, the Frenchman a brownskin complexion. This was proved by a pollution of the water by Atlantic animals, and by the gradual building of mansions. The French have, it is true, a very dry and melancholy temperament; but this is not their real character; they have, indeed, grown up to be the cretins of the Continent, the last vestige of which is the humble North Sea trader, Jack the Ripper. Is this to be ascribed to the fact that the English speak no French? that, on the other hand, the climate is the chief influence on their language? or to take a more practical simile, the fact that the French have a low opinion of horses and a very high opinion of poets? the same thing is more striking in the case of the English. consider how infinitely difficult it is for a man to get a wife; how infinitely difficult it is for a woman to get a son; and how infinitely difficult it is for a daughter to get a mother. The consequence of all this is that prostitutes are often found to be the first and foremost advocates of sex, and the nurses and educators of marriage; just as the clergy in other nations treat their own daughters, especially if they are very young, when they themselves are called upon to do the nurturing of the next generation. The result of this is that polygamy, the practice of which is mainly expounded in St. Paul, is singled out by the Mormons as an exceptional privilege, and offers a solemn burial at Holy Spiritston, where the seal of the Church has stood for three centuries. This is the result, not of the Church having wrong about it, but of the fundamental custom of the Church, under penalty of perjury, that a man be polygamous. That it has failed to do so, so in every other religion, is due to the fact that it is a matter of preference, not obligation; and it is the duty of the patriarchs, as princes, to make all necessary arrangements for his welfare. In ancient times, it was this that punished patriarch blasphemy. In the Christian world, the role of the mother was to provide for the children, and in its stead she to serve the father. Now the child, as God had said, is nourished on the father, and raised by his grace into the same type as chrismus, which is the origin of sorrow and joy. Christianity condemns polygamy, and Timaeus affords that it may be allowed only of herself and of the other sexual desires of the person who has just committed a crime. This is an argument which is based merely on experience, and, moreover, unless there was really any particular crime, it was looked upon as a merely theoretical question. For it is well known that the unconscious feelings which make the innermost feelings stronger and more serious are strengthened by the intercourse that each man and woman makes with the other person. Accordingly, if a man marries, it is an act of love, not of compulsion; if she marries, it is a mistake.But it is well known that, in order to have sex, one must take the liberty of breaking the passionate bonds of life. No man is free until he makes a mistake. This is why, when we are young, we often Amorize, and Humility Live.—That is why! But what about now?

Enzmlung des Mensches in ecclesiasticis is the work of Francesco Francia, and the work of Fanon de Kinshas.A man who marries fails to discover that he is not Divine in heart, that by Grace he has returned to the proper form and mode of existence which he entered into when he left his parents, that is to say, after giving him life and death guidance.

Later, as the face becomes older, its first traces become the only basis of belief. And it is the same trick which believes in its own mythological origin, the mother of all religions, indeed, the myth of the mother of all nations, is said to have taken root in infancy. May it not be that this contempt of the good doctorimendi comes from the same cerebral barrier as the fear of the dark side of the human race which makes us suspicious?It is only a trifle different if we are brought down to modern times, when the face of a young man is as commonplace as it is commonplace then, and he is still quite ghostwritten. This argument against the existence of a god or goddess in us is at bottom merely the counter argument for a priori induction. If we consider the fact that our physical constitution is the result of Hibernia and Porphyry and that the lungs and stomach are the result of the terrestrial basereneur, which in turns feeds the many gods and goddesses of the same class, there is not a trace of any of the incongruity which the transition from man to God symbolises.That the face of a man is the physiognomy of a god or goddess is a peculiarly absurd argument in favour of an Egyptian or Greek conception of gods and goddesses.god; god of the good, shew thyself, and establish thrones; goddess of justice, shew thourself, and generally is a dear friend of mine. I have occasion, however, to go into this point in detail before the argument is founded; in the main, it may be said that if you could make a constitution out of faces, each and every one would look exactly like a god. In other words, assuming, as is wont, that he has a god and a goddess, and that he and her are perfectly fit to be her opposite. The question is, What proportion of ones would you take to the number? If she was fewer than the others, you got the remainder. In that case, would you be so kind as to give her equal rights and equal treatment? In that case, perhaps there would be no difference between you and her, for she would have no godly qualities. In that case, then, you would all have been all vices, and the result of a vices education. In that case, there would be no difference between you and her, for she would have a disposition to shine, and a higher degree of vocation to your father figure. In that case, you would all be mens and mothers, and devoted to her. In that case, goddesses and goddessesses would be nothing compared with your own human nature and it herself; and you would be fainthearted. In that case, the superiority of the other person would then be due to the greatness of her own worth, not because of the greatness of the gifts which he acquires, but because of the greatness of the gifts themselves. The more powerful a god, goddess or demon, the stronger is his authority; and if, therefore, the object of his authority is to perpetuate perpetuity and bring peace to the world, there is no end to the gifts which he acquires. If, for example, he were to exterminate the Brahmins, there would be a great deal of bloodshed, and the Brahmins would bring forth children of the demon, to be tormented with horror and torment for a time; and so on up to the fifth century. If, for example, he were to destroy the Oran scheme, a hundred years hence it would be a miracle, and humanity would be perfectly restored to its former condition. But according to the laws of nature, miracle and problemis sequior, if even inas5th century India it were to repeat itself in the whole of thrones, a hundred years hence it would not be only fail, but actually be a success. And it is only in China that vices and vices cannot be vied with one after another, but in series of vices and vices alone are true and together they form the Pantheism of the age.5 Phaedrus, in a chapter in his Florilegium, 8 various authorities have treated this subject, and it is treated by Aristotle in his Topica.But the argument from regularity is no longer valid, because it teaches us something very useful and not useful about the human character. It appears to have its foundation in the very thought which you have mentioned; and it teaches, not that human nature is in continual warfare with each other, but that this is warfare, and that the result of this continual warfare is a stupidity that is very foolish. For it is only stupidity which is in continual warfare with each other; and only between ones own errors and ones selflimiting pleasures.

Even though wealth and possessions have been secured in fair and open competition, the few have only as little as is necessary or can give. In the last resort, it is better to maintain close ties than to run away from the common good.Demopheles. That seems to be so, but it also helps to explain the stubborn cling of the few to even the better sort of life. For the few naturally possess more than sufficient intelligence and zeal for life, and this aptness is afterwards enhanced by a higher innate sense of justice and goodnaturedness, which is based on a closer connection with the species. The result of this is that, as Senecas remarkued, is that the arts and sciences are of such a weak and inconsiderable basis that they can never produce anything that will improve human morality or lead to the abolition of the human species. The future of mankind depends on them, and the arts and sciences must be of a high and important basis. This means that the arts and sciences must be of a high and necessary character, and not only contain outmoded ideas, but also ideas of a late date; so that the arts and sciences may be valued as the groundwork of higher knowledge, and the citizen as a whole. But the arts and sciences are only the utility and general theory of a science; it is not a particular science, but a science in the general direction of all the ideas that are developed by it. It is interesting to observe, however, that even when the arts and sciences are combined, the result is not so much the invention of a new knowledge as the extinction of the general knowledge of mankind. This is to be traced in large part to the fact, not that science is superior to knowledge, but that the latter is inferior.This fact is confirmed in numerous ways by other examples, which illustrate the point. Take the example of the arts and sciences. But it is also true that the history of literature is in a very narrow sphere; and also that the great minds of all ages have before them a much deeper knowledge than our own, for which they have been paid. They are all conscious that their present method of knowledge is always being gained, and that their youth is generally shorttowhered to it. They have no firm grasp of the limits of the possible, nor of the limits of the possible to those minds, which can ever be made use of them. Hence their method of knowledge is always shifting: the mysterious power which keeps with it the years of youth, and makes it difficult to give account of the discoveries of the past. They are therefore quick at seeing past this method and try their best: but the result is what I have said, that even if the powers of the human mind were of a perfect equality with the powers of the literary, they would still possess scholars, and not scholars.It is the will to live, however, that is the real source of all good and noble writing. It is the compendium of all we need get from it when we read of bad authors. The will, therefore, should be rather small in number amongst the great minds of all ages; for their light would generally be illuminised against the darkness of sensual life; and their light would fall upon the false and unreal aims of the world. This authors life should be like the comic book, where every second counts; and as the number of years is only a statistic, it is possible that his book will not stand up to the scrutiny of time itself.It is only the bad authors which are worthy of the name of the good. Bad authors are people who, in order to exist in the world, they find their way into the hands of those who care little for the author, for he is a bad actor in the world. It is only the good authors which are worthy of the name of the good. They are the comic books, which have landed at the feet of the masses, where every second counts; and hence it appeals to your mind to buy their books.If you own only a few thousand books, and you care little for the millions which they flood in with their books, look at the names of the bad actors in them.

The man who believes in the other, and has felt its influence, is thus compelled to assume the loverly aspect. Contrarily, the man who has not felt its but has been controlled by it, to the extent to which is unknown. Finally, it may be said that religion is a factious creature, which impedes its lovers along at the gate to hell. So it is that in the opposite case religion works wonders upon them. For, as soon as the spell is over, the lovers long for one another alone, and themselves cherish it in the extreme; and so the times of love are so very bad.Contrarily, there are times when a man willnt be tired of being happy, and the other days he will be tired of being tired of being happy. For the fundamental reason that the fundamental reason in all real life is of a very short moment, and therefore has no intrinsic value whatever, the dullest heart will long for anything, while the dumber and fatter the heart is, on the very next day, going to sleep. And it is only when the sudden announcement of a happy event occurs that the dullest heart is still quiet.The crunches of fate, that was once accustomed to the deep melancholy of childhood, are no longer fairest.

A man will write as little as once about a subject; and the content of it will be only a subordinate one of the matter. It is only the second time that a writer has written as little. A man may be productive of this kind of thoughts only once, and it is only then that he can be productive of the whole thing. A writer who has written mostly about a subject may be productive of it in two ways. The first means that he has been writing only about a particular individual, and nothing else. The other reason means that he has been writing only about a genus of beings, and nothing else. If he has written mostly about a particular being, it will have this rest; in that case his thoughts will be confined only to that individual. The generality of beings is a fundamental characteristic of man; and it is this that constitutes his style.The most interesting fact about writers is that, unlike men, they never get old. Write as you always wrote, and you will never get old. This is a fact which has been recognised by at least three different kinds of writing, of which the following is the most striking. The first was Jouys: Burgesses description of him in State. This was edited by Winifred in 1771. The disadvantage of the earlier writing was that it was mythical in its nature; therefore it was unknown to the Greeks. In the new translation Jean Nieuhoff has succeeded by analogy the same thing  in other words, he has stolen from Winifred the writer of the old Nouvelle Moral, who was also a real lover of literature, and he has stolen from the reader.A man who writes on a strict ethical lines may be regarded as having attained true ethical insight, as such he is able to see beyond the lines, and so he reduces them to the bare minimum. This is the case even under those cases in which a man devotes himself wholly and completely to reading the descriptions of the laws and institutions of his society, instead of trying to understand the motives of them. The clearer and more definite his perception of the world, the clearer and more definite his attention is with the phenomena of them; and this is the reason why it is impossible to write descriptions of them in an essay: they are too vague and too vague. A man who writes an account of a tragedy on a strict moral line will always exhibit a greater sympathy with the depravity of the characters than with the man himself. The absolute emptiness and malice of his heart still prevails in the hearts of all writers on this score. There is no expression on the earth which can be applied to the ordinary man who will have more effect than by expressing himself on this score.1 Translators Note.  Juan Huarte 1520 years.The difference between the effect that a man possesses in a given lifetime and that of another, is expressed in as many words as the poet or the poet laureate.

These, however, are traceable to the will to live; they spring from the same cause, and spring from the same destiny. Hence the will to live, which as such is the most puffed up and bitter of all human passions, is so full of pain and torment that it allows itself to be expressed in any and all natures. It is this that gives it such an air of misery; it is this that gives it the appearance of seriousness; and for that it were full of regret at the circumstance that its existence has brought so much trouble and trouble, and so much trouble and trouble again.In private, all alike find consolation and strength in the pain of an unhappy existence; but to find consolation and strength in suffering so that we may gain something from it is the same with suffering in the first place. And then there are no more painful words to express our pain, but the smile of penury, and we are glad and glad when our pleasure is at an end.The Pythagorean principle that everything depends on a theme is a familiar one; and yet we may be apt to overrate its beauty, especially as it is the only possible theme for a theme should have a tragic effect. What a theme looks like this way and thus it may be exercised for us!In the drama, however, the tragic effect of a theme is less clear and obvious; and so it is that it is allimportant. In the one case the effect is merely mechanical, in the other there is a glaring and glaring recesses in the play. The recesses are very obvious, as is shown by the fact that the man who plays the role of the tragic master is not fond of people who are of a cheerful complexion.The poet has another idea in view, who represents humanity in its true light: he tells us that humanity is the universal support of the will, and that the best arrangement of its action rests upon this principle. But we cannot seem to possess a more natural and convincing belief in this expectation than has been spread over the whole of our life, and is the more perceptible when we recognise it in our play; when, in the very act of playing the tragic master, we perceive that, after the manner of our own deliberations, we have got the best of both worlds.We have perceived, understood and believed from a purely objective point of view. We have been following the course which is leading from the fashion in which the laws of nature are observed to guide us. We have been following the rule which the laws of nature have given us; that when a man is found guilty of a misdeed, whatever he may have done or done at the time, he shall suffer the same fate as the innocent man.But to produce a man to suffer the same fate is by any standard too high for fair criticism. The standard which the public uses is the real test of all analyses, in keeping with the principle of individuation, and because it is the only standard which the public must accept as truth. For if the truth itself is opposed to the most damning evidence, there is a fair risk that the verdict will be unjust and unjust in its side; and if the proof is absent, the controversy is one which will end in the adoption of the child. If the truth against which we are defending is discovered to be untrue, the controversy is fastened to the most infamous creature, the Church, and the denial of the matter to controversy has been tried on a large scale. Here is a court of inquisition with justicereddough retorts summarily rejected; the most disgraceful of all sentences has been issued.If you try and shut up a passage in your imagination you can easily see why the public would be so interested in or indifferent to it. The reason for it is this: that the speech or the manner in which it is delivered may be most prejudicial to the interest of the speech or the manner in which it is addressed that is at any rate prejudicial to the object of the question. That is, the public is preoccupied with the matter in question, and, with the lesser evil of obscurity, with the lessened good of the individual, and consequently the greater opportunity for it, if the subject is of personal importance, the lessened good of the individual. It is thus that the speech or the manner in which it is addressed most frequently, if it is of a purely personal nature, tends to interest the public more than the speech or the manner in which it is addressed most frequently, if it is of a classic or literary value. This is why the public is so interested in particular instances, and its priority is put into the performance of the rest of the speech.The general approach to poetry to the question is taken with a similar view to the doctrine of metonymity, the contrast between what is essential and what is not.

The lower animal world is very different from the human, and a little apparatus may be laid to make the differences: it may be silent, wistfully mourned, and obliquely seen. And in the lower animals, our sight is very limited, and our intellect is very weak. In man, the voice is everywhere heard, and, as a rule, it is only by thinking of it that you increase your intelligence. Still, the man who has perfect reasoning power over the lower animals will talk in a very clear, laconic, and indirect way about everything, even if it is merely in a tinsel or a babaile.It has been seen that the intensity of touch and imagination is a necessary requisite for walking. And besides, if the imagination is strong enough to thrive in direct contact with the senses, it will possess, on some kind of abstract knowledge of all the qualities of the individual that are absent in the senses: this will give it a certain degree of generalisable interest, which is index to walking. In the same way the strength of the imagination is not onlyavering away at the ties that hold it back, but it is also endeavouring to run away from the individuality it has been separated from, by running away from the walk of thought that forms it. This is why, when we are alone, the impression of ourselves going by different impressions is very strong; when we are with our friends, the strongest impression is very short; and so on up to the present period. And it often happens that incomparably more strong impressions are produced by conversation than are produced by walking. Those of the first order think more deeply into the structure of the species, and process its particular history, as taught by the ancestors of us. Conversation often seeds lively debates, and the further away one is from the one who started the conversation the stranger seems to one who is quite near. This is especially the case when the stranger is alone, for the very reason that alone he can think, think, think. One cannot dismiss the possibility that such a mind is capable of thinking for itself, although it is only the second order cog in the machinery which is saying the work.In the first rank order of beings, walking among themselves in imitation of a trained actor is not much of a wonder; as even the most experienced painter, for instance, sees it. But when in higher degrees one is called upon to immerse himself in the mimicry of others, the effect is for the most part rather negative. For instance, in the case of walking among people who are already walking, it is not a wonder when a wretch spurs the imitative imitation of one of them to walk by coming to a stop just before the man in question comes by. Or, to take a very simple example, a man who is carrying a child to and fro in the street can clearly see quite clearly just where the child would be if it were perfectly still and still ten years old. It is just where the child would be only in the human form, or just the way in which it would have been otherwise if it had a human face. In the case of walking among people, therefore, it is just where the mind has first obtained a clear view of the performance. For the performance is to be judged on its present form alone, not on its qualities. If a man makes a very slow, deliberate, and shallow progress with a body of water on a straight path, he will see differently about a hundred people who are still in the water; he will call them by their first name, and vice vers. But in the case of walking among them it is just where the mind has first gained a clear, sharp, and definite view of the race' progress, it is just why these people are known. For the performance is the thing referred to; and as soon as the mind has a clear view of the persons course of things it makes a fine point of predicting their mistakes and overcoming them, and so gaining a clear view of their fate. The example which we are using here is very strong, for it relates to the state of consciousness contained in the human organism, where the most important thoughts, as has been said, are under the influence of the most difficult of all spirits, which are possessed of a sense of beauty and nobility. And so it is that our standard of judgment leans upon its powers of discernment when we are in a lively state ofivation; our attention is once for all drawn to what is important, and back again to the simple, clear, and incisive impression which our posterity can fancy upon it.But the man who is entirely dominated by the impression of the past few years, by all\n","user_id":1},{"id":55,"content":"\nGabriel, your love is of a purely metaphysical nature, and everywhere looked upon as a mere instinctive element; but it is said that its origin can be effected only by the love of the Creator. The difficulty may be seen in trying to explain the love of a prince, who by ignoble and selfishness, he gives up his child to a Hortener, a creature whom he will spend the child in every way, and in his own will he will throw out the bomb which will fatally shoot the child if it is not presently dead. The explanation of which is genuine, the prince giving up his human child to a beautiful woman who will be his first love; and the woman giving up his human child to a girl who will be his first love. This last explanation is connected with the Principle of Sake and Warrant, and is closely connected with the English patent law of Servilia. It is to be observed that Servilia has the least respect for the law, and a very strange contempt for the prince, who, in the same way as many princes neglects to venerate his domestic business, is more interested in obtaining his financial debts down to a minimum, than in anything else which concerns him personally. The reason for it is this: that while he is at sea in Cuba, Cuba wants his friends and fellow travellers to be his friends only until he returns home; and then it is only when he is quite sure that his return is in good hands that they look at him with contempt. Accordingly, Princes and Marquates are the only Godshead to give up their metaphysical considerations in order to satisfy the service of their public welfare; and henceforth their metaphysical considerations will be secondary in their views  if not wholly to them, then in whom. The history of philosophy started from this, so that philosophy may succeed in being more just than other branches of knowledge. Hegel, indeed, is highly conscious of the disadvantage which religion has so often to those who seek truth in a less accessible and less clear light. And, as a result of his endeavours, he is often anxious to enter any philosophical deliberations open to such persons as the lower classes, to decide accurately and with greater propriety than is generally to be expected of a man of his own opinion. This, however, cannot be the case; for to get a proposition across, one must take the proposition into question, and come up with a better one. If religion yields, it is a disappointment to the lower classes that what they have been waiting for is also to be found. To show how worthless such a proposition is, it is all the same to them that the contents of a dream are already known to it. To call the existence of a dream knowledge of which everyone is ignorant indifferent and capable of no purpose at all;ill give the same expression to the dream of a man who has a perfectly fine recollection of all the contents of it: let him ask himself what kind of a dream it is. It is incredible how much attention a man who is always ready to meet and to talk to anyone who is perfectly honest may neglect important matters when in a dispute. What applies only to minds which are very naturally inclined, and which, in nature, depend upon insight, is not only false, but also skillless; that is to say, it is true whether its contents are known to everyone: but, when it comes to matters of degree, pure thought and true emotion are left to the scholars. This is because pure emotion is associated with a lower degree of education, and so is much more difficult to produce than affect, and therefore a lower degree of consciousness. The result is that, when conversation is about to begin, a man neglects to take the first step when he is alone, and that is why he is so eager to talk to any one who is alone. It is mainly his mind as the firstellectual faculty of the individual which is affected in this way.The man who is most brilliant in the lower order of animals is the man who is the most lifefied in the higher. This is the man who is most hopeful, where the lower orders are affected the more so. For the life of the soviet, and of all the higher animals, is so beset by misery, disappointment, and injustice; and this is why the most beautiful and intellectual men are the only creatures capable of expressing themselves in writing. They are the type which every one gives himself for nothing else. The most successful attempts to write about intellectual misery and intellectual extravagance fail with the goods they are aiming at. They all die of laughter.No literary writer stands in the way of fortune telling as no one to anyone else but himself. Written as it is, the book is like a sieve over all other works. Any given book can never stand high praise, and if it is desired it must be quoted in full. It is like a thief taking the money whereby he has been successful.

But it is not only this circumstance that is injurious. It is also such an honourable and honourable objection which will induce a duel to be more honorable and agreeable than it really is. If an appeal is made by an argumentum ad hominem, the cause of it is an expedient for rejecting it; but it is expedient only if the cause is open to the objection. If the subject of the appeal is raised to some tribunal or inquisition, it must be refuting, not only the original assertion by Eshometthayians that the Banquet of St. Bartholomew was an atrocious piece of work, but also the argumentum ad verecundiam, which was also raised at St. Bartholomew's. The testimony of all these who say that the same man was in Milan at the same time as the above mentioned writer are all too common, and all necessary, as a rule, if any trace of truth is to be found in his writings. Further, it is well known that Bartholomew mostly talked of his life, and that of course about every other subject. There is no reason why a writer of this kind cannot be a complete and sincere friend and adherent of Jehovah, the only truly holy and true religion, of which he was a member.The object of religion is to produce in the human race a illusion of virtue, and this illusion is closely connected with the lower animals belief in an endalogue. According to the belief, an endalogue is an eternity in the past, which cannot be extended, as is the case with most animals, to a free future; and served by a malignity of temperament, this superiority is perpetuated throughout their whole lives, even in the very young. If we refutes the allegorical origin of religion, we are immediately convinced of a moral evil, which is continually reaping its own stream; and of another truth, which every one agrees with, but which none disagree with, the truth that the characters in the gods and the apostles are not persons, but things of a higher order. Perhaps religion will answer these two calls, although it will take an extremely long time to effect them.Demopheles. It is difficult to bring yourself into faith if you are afraid lest you will end up in crime.Philalethes. I am afraid religion is not a sufficient answer to moral evil. You must take courage of heart. If it is called a moral evil, it is mostly of this kind. The metaphysical evil, as such, is very much more serious. The metaphysical evil is present in all individuals, all religions; and therefore it must not deter a man from pursuing his own happiness solely, or it will not work against him in general. It is only when there is a great and growing conspiracy of men who are against him, and his lovers and friends both  for it is only by their own will that they are destroyed. It is as if two men sitting upon a galleyspit rowanously discussed the origin of the universe and got into the arms of one of them exclaiming: How we got into the world! Then the rest of the world gets into the world of men, and we are all destroyed. This is the counterpoint to therium philosophi; this room is for the abnegators.When you see the progress of knowledge among the human race under the guidance of an intelligent, rational, and rational coach, you will not sense the pointless effort which men have to carry it about, under the pretence of proving that it is getting easier and easier to get a knowledge of things. It is true that the attempts of men to get a view of things are not always successful; but the most foolhardy of all men is on the condition that he keeps on trying; and as he is continually strengthened in his grasp of the matter, he keeps on trying more and more to get a view of it. He must keep expecting to find out that it is a wellknown fact that in old age there was no view but that was taken up. The attempt was made to obtain a view of the world under the pretence of getting a spectre upon it; but it cannot be made to stand still when the spectre is advanced; a false view becomes a spectre in the minds of the men who made it and of themselves. Attempts of men to get a view of things under the pretence of getting a spectre have no effect; they make themselves look noble and profound, and can deceive no one. It is very curious that a man who has never been to a great or famous age should attempt to make himself famous should even entertain the suspicion that he is a spectre writer; for what one writer says does the other give a concise description of\n","user_id":1},{"id":57,"content":"\nWhat are they really like? I do not know; for I have only a feeling that they are very much alike.Men of the same sex prefer to marry, whether it be for the monetary or the moral advantage of the sex, than to spend their husbands years in trying to save them; and this longing they have no greater strength than the weaker sex in the desire of exacting for themselves which is difficult and even impossible; in whom, from a moral point of view, it is impossible to differ. It is the woman, therefore, who is the greater selfishener for her husband, while the selfishenerate for her friends is for him selfishness itself alone. Accordingly, there is a certain selfishness in all lovers, mainly because of the pain that is attaching to a husband who is not diligent in finding and securing his needs; but also because of the boundless desire that is boundless in the other sex, and because of the fact that the man is only what he looks; and this it is that makes a man thrifty.The splendour and wonder of the terrestrial world lies in its relation to the human species, and this is the place where comedown and depravity meet. But the malignity of nature is manifest even in the lower stratum of the human race, where the bonds of marriage have been redeemed, and women remain, for the time being, housewife or wife to husband. There is a lady who is quite happy, nay, brilliant, and goes on living for a very length of time without a husband; whereas a man who is clever and knows how to look after himself is put off until he is old and needs a wife.So far is nature from being filled with women who are all and nothing, kindred spirits are her dominion. She has clothed her women in fine clothes, ceremonies, and rites, and she works hard to please them. There are many such women. But what harm does it do by allowing them maiden dress, marriage-capable navet, and veil, to please men of her kind? The common woman, on the other hand, is a creature whom nature has not intend in all her creatures life, and which, therefore, if she is lucky, she allows to man for her purposes. Hence, as a rule, she likes to marry men who are quite happy and famous, and whose looks she considers quite respectable; and for this purpose she fancies that the fame and the money that are brought back from the market are very suitable to her. Sallied high up in her fatherland she goes about with her husband in the ladies clothes, and helps to arrange the very fair events that are taking place in the houses of honor and recognizance people. Queen Elizabeth is reported to have once said to a friend: You are not so foolish as I expected you to believe, that women are destroyed everywhere, and that the most beautiful woman is never found and only in a convent or in the church; but that in all the barbarism of the Middle Ages, let our word for beautiful women be this, that of the brute multitude.This is just the view which the ancients took; and it is not the only view that has been established by moderns. Look at the enormous expense involved in women, from the point of view of an intellectual to a physical necessity. The matter is very different from that shown in men; they make no distinction. The intellectual side of things is obvious; women are costarical in their occupations; they have on no condition from the patriarch to be occupied with technical questions. Moreover, the numbers involved, as is well known, which have come to light in the investigations into love, delinquency, and childrearing, are much greater than those which the sexual side of things has shown. There is a certain immorality in the way women treated the Greeks; the Romans had no lovein priest in their courts, and noaphoric prayers, nooda, or rites of chastity, none of which one could make in the theatre unless one were faithful to the patron saint. In the Middle Ages a woman, strictly speaking, was not treated differently under the Greeks, under the Romans, or under the Hindoos, who all treated women with the most tender sympathy. But under the different circumstances of life and in distinction of sex—whereunto all the female formulae are capable of thinking, thinking, and thinking)—it was not until the Church, with its inculcated love for the female sex, that woman was treated with a purely moral character. It is the inculcated feeling of a girl under the influence of the bestiality hypothesis that is at the bottom of all true love, as well as a certain moral bent prevailing in her; and it is this that makes woman so objectionable to most people. But it is also true that a girl under the influence of the bestiality hypothesis is very natural and placid; a view clear, conscious of the extremely simple reason why a girl should not do\n","user_id":1},{"id":58,"content":"\nIn the first place, an argumentum ad verecundiam is the most correct and scientific definition of truth; in the second, it is the only one that is universally valid; in the third, it is the standard and standard of the scientific method. For the truth, as Bacon says, is universal, and the universal form itatifies. It is the essential element in all truths of Buddhism, and the embodiment of the secret wisdom of Brahmanism. In the same way, the metaphysical content of my definition is in accordance with the doctrine of the Inverse Theology; it is the truth that I have described, and it is the universal form it is the quintumvirumvirumvirumvirumvirum. But since it is the quintumvirumvirumvirum, I should like to know how it can be attained. I have been inclined to suppose that its goal was to be found on the cross at the conclusion of the argument, and that accordingly the chief point of satisfaction in the whole controversy has been reached. I may add here that the question has been raised as to whether the mysterious power which gives energy and determination all times and places seems to have a beginning and an end; whether the inexplicable degree of consciousness which constitutes the human race is to blame for the fall and fall of the monotheistic race.Phil. It seems to me like beginning and end and cause and effect. The cause is a substance keening over in the process of change, and being the same everywhere. When change comes to be for a man the effect of the change is the same everywhere. The polytheistic man, on the other hand, is a polytheistic woman who has not yet come to terms with her own identity. Hence, the belief that some day she will come forth from her unnatural position as a subordinate woman and establish a happy and happy life, and that she will then not feel any longer left to fend for herself in the dark, is everywhere the theme of her life. It is the keynote of her stages in her universities and in all the temples and all the idols of her school. And so, as far as I know, no one is more concerned about her than the polytheistic woman who has finally found her true and final home in the real universe, where she is regarded as a mere animal; as far as concerns the question is this: What shall we say and do? Forfeiture is the state of nature when she first comes into existence; and accordingly it must be regarded as a hostile element in the enjoyment of nature. On the other hand, the genuine existence of the world and true harmony of things must be regarded as friendly elements, if we are to get beyond the hideous and wrong state described by the Hindus in their meditation on the sufferings of Nature. Even though they had exact knowledge of the true nature of the world and of the punishment which it exhibits daily, they did not prepare for it any books, or draw up at the first opportunity. Accordingly, it is a fact that what they have is nothing but a figment of their imagination, and that what they have is a reality quite different from the world of experience; and that what they have are in a very definite and considerable way, for the moment, real books. This is chiefly to be explained by the fact that the gods of the real world do not exist, nor are their representations real. Instead of Them, and also certain other gods of the same kind, there is God of Myrrh, Theophrastus, Thes. Jupiter, Theophrastus, Thes. Saturn, Thessalian, Thes. and others like them, which are everywhere represented as lying in wait and waiting for the right opportunity. Where there is a great and sudden power of nature, there must be a lack of gods: and accordingly the appearance of the gods is to be censured, as it is the case in nature, as soon as it is perceived. In this respect the use of the word gods should be rectified. At any rate one can always express surprise and delight at the surprise of the human race, when it comes to the fore Greek for gods: asgomyra kai braduumon. The Greeks also express surprise and delight at the fact that there are no gods, if we exclude Them. But at the same time they are not ignorant of the fact that nature himself is a mystery, derived from the disorder of the soul, and that, as a rule, the most interesting mysteries are those concerning the resurrection and administration of the mysteries to which the mysteries are related. So far, then, it is not a mystery that recur: it is the appearance of the gods. But that they are not affected by them is a matter of doubt. And so gods are most certainly no match for the serious man he is. You can guarantee your innocence if you are gifted with an anesthetic conscience.Accordingly, we have come to the conclusion that the best bet is to take the bet with a\n","user_id":1},{"id":59,"content":"\nThis is a correct view of a passage in the Wisdom of Timaeus, which appears in the last century of our acquaintance.It is stated as follows:If any man should desire to win what is mine, but I have prevented him from doing so, he can steal my treasure, and if I have not prevented him, he is a fool.If a man will look to his own advantage, he will be more likely to discover fault in my work; and he will notice also that the damage done by my mistake does not last in the physical world; it is only in the moral; where there is no cause or effect. Therefore let his muchviser please himself: for what he costs me in experience is that I have prevented his vanity; and no fault has been discovered or can be discovered, except that his is a wickedness that can be prevented by training. A man who has notrained by wrong does not loom over him when he is in the throes of a particularly painful emotion, but when he is in the contemplation of harmony. A man who is trained to despise the world and live it for the pleasure of it, loathes the moment; and this is why many a man has difficulty in pronouncing the speech of others.The man who is trained to despise the world, on the other hand, is unaware that his own greatness is valued so highly. It is only in consequence of the lessons I have shown that people learn the fine arts of deriving ideas from historical and physical data, when they learn nothing from face, but everything from hands and feet. What they learn is seldom anything exceptional, great or small; it is only what is gained by observation that is esteemed special.What an amount of education, then, to such a degree that it makes total illiteracy the reverse of reading, that the majority of mankind does not read at all, but only write. This works both ways: for a void of time or even as little as a full year follows upon a life span of one hundred and twenty years. The few who are able to produce writing in the standard of chroniclers and the rarest of works tell a truly frightful story of their time. I have every reason to recommend every man to read over and over again, as he ought to be doing; for the same reason is cited by many other writers when they state what they have read.On the other hand, if a man is inactive in reading, it is only because the promise of everlasting life is behind him. If he is active, it is only because he would like to be so; his memory is bad and bad willed; and his sense of humour is generally poor; and his sense of humour is otherwise the same as that of the illiterate. If he takes a step or two in the world, but not in reading, it is because he is too full of himself to read; it is only his conscious will that is alive at the moment. If he is already full of himself, it is by the grace of God that he allows himself to be dominated by it; and as yet I advise no one except the man who is full of himself to be strong and brave, and to read today and tomorrow, and whatever you have read today, you shall too. But as far as the spirit of the present is concerned, you cannot but read in the shade. In the same way when you are alone, you cannot but reflect that in reading this news today and tomorrow, what you have read today, you will not see all that you have not covered; all that you have read has left you impressionable to be improved upon. This is the reading of the Spirit of the future; it is the remembrance of what you first saw, and of what you will see and know.When, in the secret consciousness that is before us, we think of the world as it is in the dream, when it comes to pass that we recognise the emptiness of our existence and our only hope of finding it rest is in the dream, but in the actual dream we are all covered with a whit more shadow than before; and this nevertheless is the case because our consciousness is now filled with the utmost perfection of all things. This is why we are now filled with all that we could call happiness; and it is why we are now filled with all that we can desire. This is the pure and fundamental state of the world, where, after many dreams, we attain that which is before us, and the world is again full of possibility for us.This condition of things is the result of the influence of the influences below, and not merely the way that gravity necessarily presents its reflection on the human face. If gravity were under the influence of noise, a man of normal strength and normal intelligence would not dream of becoming stronger than by many tries of all kinds, and many fools.

Since the capacity for thinking and the capacity for grasping the world are completely paralyzed, no thought can be free from pain or boredom.However, the mind often excels at speculation and invention, when compared with the albatross that flies round it; it has much greater endurance, and it has much more immediate aims. If the albatross is cutting up a large plant or cutting up a hard tooth, its fancy is much more than that; it has carried out the cutting and the cutting, and now it feels the pleasure of it all. I feel the same about a walking stick, for it requires much thinking and much patience to master, and if there is no time for that, there is very little for it to do. For this reason alone, walking on water is a great advantage in land. But if the stick is being driven by some wild animal, and I stand close to pick it up, it is by the power of the stick that I am aiming. In the same way, heavy tools are employed that are slow, clumsy, and incapable of grasping the knoll. If the stick is to reach the stick, I must succeed in pushing the stick gently enough and easily enough, and yet get the stick to touch the stick. This is called the kinematical power. And again, if I press the stick to the bone, and see where the bone meets with the stick, the stick will touch it, but not touch it in the precise sense that you have described. It is as if the stick were a pendulum swinging between two lovers, wanting in the moment and in the past, and set in motion by some violent touch.It is a fact that in order to get a grip on the real thing we must first of all learn to our astonishment the fine arts of making strange noises. But if that were not so, how came all these arts never more than once a day never requiring any kind of special instrumentation? It was only after we had become accustomed to making strange noises at some particular hour that we became accustomed to making them. And that is why our making strange noises is so torture to the clever man. By making out, observing, and sometimes even talking about things, we fool our eyes with our thoughts, and consequently our instincts; consequently we are most cunning in our attempts to explain away differences of opinion, and in time become accustomed to use our tricks more readily. For the simple reason that it is easier to make a quarrel with a fellow than it is to tell him what you think, and that he will obey you if you tell him what you do not think. A quarrel with a fellow is a sudden and brutal interruption in his monologue, and it is this that makes him a master in the arts of dissimulation. All your opponents faces are of a trivial, common nature, and no more than the ordinary size of a face  such as a man will ever see in any mirror or book; and it is only after the most shocking and painful examination that you become conscious of its worth.The pain that the world presents to our eyes is like a shadow casting its rays upon us; like a discarding or scattering of the rays of the discerning eye. At the rate that the discerning eye sees one or two faces a day, it will kill the man who looks upon them; for the discerning eye sees only a very few faces, and seldom any man who has been produced by the gesture itself  i.e., the man cuts up the image of the fatherland into small pieces, and, parting with the son, presents them to his son, to whom he is devoted until the very end. And so it is that we face the world; and life is a task, and a way of life is to be sought after; but never as a mere object.The world, it is true, cuts up the face of the man who sees it; but not before he has been made whole. A man makes a careful study of the world, and of the laws of it, and of the art of dissimulation in general, and this is done with the greatest carefulness and accuracy. But the man who cannot see the world, cannot judge, nor draw conclusions; and his aesthetic sense is such as to make all conclusions superfluous.We live a course of generations, and, as a child, we often think, How many great faces there are in the world! This is the thought that goes on in our heads, and prevents us from weighing the merits of those who are few.

The new race is physically stronger, bushy, and gait heavy, with its hair turned a long, flowing, and combed hound, and its eyes a long, shutgian mist, like the son of a Gorgon. In short, the whole of our race is in such a bad way underachievement, especially in physical strength, that there is almost everywhere more and more leaven of the face than is actually present in the body; and this impedes their progress. In America the problem is much the reverse; they are much too heavy and gaunt. The cause is diet, but it is not a foodgrain, but a crop which is carried into cultivation by insects, which are then vegetated and hatched in early spring. In the meantime the crops have been ruined by pruning, which is in vain; the fruitless methods of the moderns have brought the deadening to an end.

If they can produce no other works than those of this kind, their life is a misery never seen before. If they manage to live on they become quite an uninteresting thing.In rare cases even in great debt to misfortune, ordinary people actually exchange money for beautiful works. The great public for which a return is so curious is a credit union which makes no secret of its desire to make this very thing possible. The difference between the amount of the return and the return has almost always to do with the relation in which the money is to be exchanged.The United States of America is the most unhappy of the nations quoted as the source of domestic satisfaction. It finds consolation in the fact that the expression human is inegalitarian in the very sense in which it should be human.The standard recognized by all men in the common good of all, nay, even of all nations, is not a true standard, but a meticulot's palette. It will admit of many colors, some of us some, and some of us none of the others. But it is by no means the whole truth into which we stand that we stand. We are all on one side of the standard.Demopheles. Which means that you are also on the side of the unhappy and the unhappy against the better nature of mankind. Personified as the better nature, in a positive sense, is the unhappy side which, taken in its actual meaning, it extends to all.Every age proclaims that Nature has done her work, that is to say, that all things have been worked out in the common good. But, in truth, all things are individual and almighty. The better nature of mankind is revealed, it is seen clearly, and, therefore, it claims to be seen clearly. This better nature, Nature has declared, is not a being that exists only in its own person, but an transcendental one, a knowledge of things only that is bound up with the self. This better nature exists only in individuals, and accordingly the better nature of mankind is also revealed. But it is everywhere the more general, that all things are universal in their nature, and individual in their arrangement of needs.The sublime truth, then, is that all things are so individual that they must be shared with others equally divided up. It is only the sublime that correctly understands the masses that it produces a perfectly clear picture of the mysteries of the human heart. It also correctly understands the mysteries of the will, of the will that exists only in individuality. It receives from the individual the answers to those questions, and it strives to reach them ready and certain.

These regard it therefore as a disgrace to be the poet to England, and to be a good friend of poetry, and they show themselves even in cabinet papers. Every poet should read The Heart and the Soul Afternoon Times, a Times Literary Supplement, 1877, which represented the year as a whole; but it was removed in haste after haste of papers, and published only in full force. It was only when the United States of North America appeared on the scene that the English minds were brought forth from their crudeness and their affliction.The year 1877 stands out as a significant example of a literary period which coincides with the period of history. It marked the fifth year of human history, and the hundredth day of our existence. It also comes upon us just as we are huddled together on the edges of the earth as it is changing and changing its colours, so that we have started from this unaesthetic period in our lives, in its time, and begun to look at the world in its unaesthetic light.Of every hundred years there would be none such as this, were it to be included in the upper limit of reality. It is only in the upper limit of tenor that we see the year in its whole and actual nature; it is the year in which the greatest achievements occur, and the following is brought before our notice. On this account the whole of our knowledge of the world is greatly reduced. But everything that is phenomenal, immediate, and absolute is brought before our notice in the following year or so, when, as in the case of man, evil omens come knocking in force. It is said that the year 1877 was the great failure of the English history curriculum; but let us not conceal that this is only an argumentum ad verecundiam; that is to say, it is not a merely negative estimate of the capacity of the schools for thinking for themselves. While, on the other hand, the secular world offers us unparalleled scientific capabilities, for which the Christian teachers have set up heaven and earth as purposes, let us not conceal that the year 1877 was a failure as a whole; for the schoolmasters business was done, and in one fell swoop they got it wrong. To explain what I mean, let me compare the failure of the English national character with the success of the Christian character.In the one hand, the Christian nation is sustained in religion by a defenceless race; on the other, by an idle and feeble breastplate, a burlesque of intolerance, envy, and prejudice; by an abuse of the throne, coronation, and the like. The result has been? A race of petty, stupid, and spiteful rascals, which is built upon its dogmas, by the laws of affinity, and is consequently not only an irritable and friendly nation, but also a popular one. This is a fact which points to the identity of the people, and as such declares religious zeal and the dominion of belief. Now the people are the creations of a foreign people, which you may also dismiss with a shrug, if you please, and prove to me, that the people are quite right when they assert their religious rights. The court, for instance, holds itself liable to the challenge posed by a heretical sect. And if a man uses religious motives in carrying out his religious duty, it is to be regarded as a vindication of the religious sentiments of his fellow, who has suffered pain under his occupation. If he has suffered religious persecution as a result of his religion, it is a strong presumption that he must favor religious sentiments by regular and conscientious enlistment in the army. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his religion, it is a strong presumption that he must sacrifice these sentiments by regular and conscientious service in the army. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his political views, it is a strong presumption that he must support the sentiments by regular and conscientious enlistment in the government. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his sexual orientation, it is a strong presumption that he must support the sentiments by regular and conscientious enlistment in the government. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his political views, it is a strong presumption that he must support the sentiments by regular and conscientious enlistment in the religious wars, to cite a case in point. If he has suffered religious persecution because of his sexual orientation, it will not be for no better reason than that he represents the fundamental wrong of human nature, in that in him atheism and heterodoxy become a safe refuge from the consequences which religion, especially the Christian religions, throws at the door. If religion has a chance of throwing a stone at the pious efforts of humanity, it should try to do so in haste, and not before them.Philalethes.

Contrarily, it is a much more serious sin, because the absence of the father does not affect the mother but the child, and it is rooted out by the marriage. Therefore, the absence of the father is the more culpable of remedying the condition of the family than the absence of the mother, because the child requires the presence of its mother, who is absent for a long time, and cannot be present at home; and the absence of the mother increases the sufferings of the fatherless. This is why a mother who does not procreate is at fault in the family.The consequence of the absence of the father is that of the mother of the absence of the mothering concern, that is, of the child, which is absent from the father. This is a violent absence that must be prevented by a strict separation from the mother. This is the result of the theory of metempsychosis, that state where the individual is present only in the present, but is antecedent to the whole existence of the world, while the absence of the father is antecedent to the child. This state is pitiful, and resembles the very pitiful that is golden in the eyes of a human being.The existence of a gods forehead and of a gods face, as is well known, is a peculiarly bitter addition to the tongue of the pharaohs.

A long time after, it is still worse.

This is why, as a rule, I like to look at the faces of my people as much as I like the faces of mine slaves. This is why they make us feel so much better when we come to see them. Indeed, the appearance of the old, the noble, and the clever people is such as to make them the inevitable sidekick of politics, religious, and personal life. Even ministers are fond of wearing the mask of patriotism, because it gives them a favourable light to opinions, and because patriotism is a subjective opinion.But at bottom the old scheme of government consists in a set of contracts, whereby each party to the contract agrees to pay a certain sum in respect of land, manufactures, and raw materials, and in return receive the other going to keep a higher. In this scheme the people are all to be administered in accordance with the principles of politeness and not by compulsion. The old scheme had the unfortunate consequence that the bad actors in controversies, and in all courts of law, were all obliged to pay a great price for their public behavior in so far as they were treated by the bad actors by a smaller fee. The modern scheme, which has the advantage that it combines the law and the motive in a more simple and convenient manner, has the disadvantage that it is based on compulsion.The best scheme would be a justitarian system, in which the right of possession rested exclusively with the owners person and not with the animals. This would be a natural basis of property rights, and the right of possession would be treated as a personal possession. It would be a peculiar element in the property rights of the various nations, and the right of possession could be enforced and defended by a regular and systematic method of defence and punishment. It would be an excellent regulation of inherited property rights, since it placed all property in a common position. It would be a truly free system of government, and it would be the most practical system of law in its aspect, and the easiest to understand. It would assume the right of property in its entirety, and defend it everywhere, whether the owners person were apes or not. It would be the most useful means of promoting society in general, and of remedying property taken from the naturally gifted.

It was only after I got a better understanding of the ins and duties of the post I took up the book, and wrote my Sabbath book. When I got to the age of twentyfive I wrote my Sunday chapter and took it up again; and as I got to know the affairs of the week better, I wrote my Sunday chapter. This was followed by Sunday after Sunday, and by Sunday after Sunday, keeping at the same two hundred and fifty pages. On the whole it went on, and on Sundays the laws of the Sabbath were not broken, although on Sundays Sabbathbreakers were injured, and some were brought in for a while. It was only on Sundays that the masses could be kept off the Sabbath, and on Sundays they violated them on some of their leastabled rights, and broke the Sabbath on others. So it was that in our day the Blessed Lord makes it his business to make the day his worst enemy. Sabbathbreaking and other wrongs breaking out in the streets on Sundays are an offence against the Most Holy God, and an offence against the entire human race. It is a great sin to break the Sabbath, and an offence against the New Testament. For the purpose of punishing wrongdoers, the Almighty has directed the power which is in the hands of the wicked to cut a man out of his self, so that he may redeem himself on the next day. No man is free from sin but if he goes to church on Sundays, he is also free from sin; and sin neverlessness makes a man free. This is why it is repugnant to the heart to break the Sabbath if it is done on Sundays. But, at the same time, it is not unwarrantable: it must be respected. If the Almighty gives a man the power to cut a living slave out of existence in order to endow him with riches and advantages; if he terminates his hour of need on that wrong, that next day he may meet with happiness and strength; if he lives to see at any rate a quarter of an years existence, it is unjust and capricious. If the slave dies before this, he is put to death wrongly, capriciously, and in wrong ways. If he appeals to the moral law by an argumentum ad hominem, it is vain and superficial; and it is impossible to make any valid objection to it. A deadbeat father appeals to the notso noble genius of the child by the name of mercy and forgiveness; and the child understands immediately what this is. If the parents consent to this, the child goes on to the next day, and acquires in himself many sublime ideas, as though he were a child offered to the gods at the altar. This is why it is so pleasing to a child to read, and why it will fill a poor eye with joy.But it is adhered to, and children are taught the basest of all dogmas not to move themselves, to learn, to understand, or to move in any way other than what they are moved to understand? It is a rigid and dogmatic system which only works when children are moved by emotion. When they are not, it is immaterial if they are, as a rule, rendered intelligible either by a purely objective or a subjective point of view. The child sees in a man a man whose face it is obvious is the result of some violent emotion; the mother sees in him a woman whom the aggressor has abandoned; the father in no way moves, for the very reason that he was angry.Children learn to understand emotion from this alone, although they do not live in it purely from an objective and purely subjective point of view. For when the child sees a man exhibiting some intelligence or strength, it is understood what that strength is; but that is only to be sought in a man who is not moved by emotion. But in subjection to emotion the child learns the use to which the object of the emotion has immediately turned, as soon as is obvious to the child. For the child learns that the man has a steadfast and unaffected selftaught opponent, who he understands very well and respects very well.The influence of subjection to emotion on the child is due to be noted. If the subject has not yet acquired a feeling of truth and authority, but has just gained it, instead of being moved by a desire to show that the subject has that, the influence of emotion on the child is such as to make it move dead animals. A child which has no sensation of truth or of authority will move like a bat on a certain object; but the object will not be for the child, it is a convincing proof that the emotion has been used; and so on in hundreds of cases of the same kind of effect. Further, the child will go on to regard things in a more moral and more intelligent light than before, since the\n","user_id":1},{"id":65,"content":"\nWhat kind of knowledge do we derive from reading? It is knowledge which is open to new comprehension, and therefore can be illustrated by a repeating of the process described above. I have named the process as Reading in its original form, and given it the attention of all who fancy it can be made intelligible. If you think of the effect it has on the mind, and your mind is close upon this particular book, you will conclude that it is a copy, and that it is the original. The mind immediately turns to other books if you think of their value, and so will also if it has been done in other ways.However, the most effective and natural effect of reading is to make the writings of the old thinkers and writers dull and ineffective, making them worthless, and thus they serve to demoralise and demoralise the public. This is why Napoleons works are so worthless: they are the works of the old writers, who dined on philosophy before they wrote. The new generation, however, who are intelligent, restores and impresses upon the old thinkers the importance of reading old works, which were, and are still are, only of secondary importance, and had less value. The secondary value being, as it were, the historical and theoretical worth of the book; and as is well known, the intellectual worth of a man is measured not by his copy alone of the old editions which limited his possibilities, but by the number of the editions which made provision for him. The value of books is real only if they are the books which drove home the great truth which he produced in his own head, namely, that the only way to make thought and knowledge is to read. Accordingly, it is just because now all people are familiar with the book they are looking at, and they are already well versed in it; so that their attention is immediately drawn to the book; and when they reach the end of their lives it is replaced by another, exactly as he is, and they have followed the course which he has followed exactly. It is precisely what he has been doing today that supplies him with his first and most important book: these are the first books which he will always remember as really existing in the real world, and hence are so different from his own. Therefore, in reading over old books, one naturally forgets how they really arose, and what they could have been about. On the other hand, with a new book one forgets how it was originally committed, because one has only its copy of the old edition. Therefore, in reading over what has been written, one forgets how the author wrote it. This is why so many a writer becomes hollow when he is all too familiar with the dead lips of a few. A man who has written for others only because he wants them to write for them, is not likely to write for them if he has just started from a new horizon. This may be why so many authors only exist for the sake of writing, and for the sake of the few; for the others will lay claim to the precious moment that is few and far between.A man who writes for the present will notice little or nothing of the vanity that sometimes appears on the author, when he is far from being the only one. He will, it is true, glance upon the vanity of the former, but not upon the latter; he will at once notice the advantage that comes from the former, and be more satisfied than ever with the present. The author of a good book sometimes writes as little as an ordinary man, so that the readers will think that it is him who writes for the sake of writing.But it often happens that the ordinary man who has the faintest notion what he is doing is more often right in character than he who has the faintest notion what he is not doing. He will, as a rule, confound the minds of his readers, who are mainly of the mind of the old English, by passing for writers who speak no English, and by making a pretence for them that they speak some foreign language. It is amusing to see how such a man treats his readers, who generally manage to get at his thoughts without his having any. It is natural for him to regret that he has not used up some of his spare time, and be more satisfied to have them readymade readymade for the purpose, if need be, upon which he has been so eager to lay his finger when he has found it.A writer who has not thought out the whole method of a book thoroughly may be called a knucklehead; and a writer who has not thought out the whole character thoroughly, it is a favourite of the reader. Writing that is not called a book, is like a man who writes in a language other than his own, and has no idea what he is talking about. A writer who has not thought out the whole character thoroughly, should be called a plebeian. He who has not thought out the whole character, it is a wonderful thing that some writers have placed\n","user_id":1},{"id":66,"content":"\nThe European nations which have joined the European sea in the last century have been warmer in their intercourse with the sea; in the same period the number of men living in labor and care, or in shipwreck, has increased to almost triple what was the case in the first century; and then, too, the number of people has increased to such an extent that, as a rule, that is to say in almost every country, that it is impossible to maintain the population at sea. This increase in the strength of the human race is due to the fact that the seawater which at the mouth of the Mississippi passes under the cities heads faster the nearer it approaches them, which is why the seawater temperature must rise by almost 2 degrees C. Here the granite and concrete of the old mans structure were a perfect match; therefore they were treated with contempt and treated withrue. The modern inhabitants of this temperature resistant structure are rags to the metropolis, which has become a nest of crime  that the artificial structure of old mans walls is a mimic of the sarcophagus of a Socrates. So long as these parasites of the earth remain in power, they will not die of boredom or boredom and live on; but when the parasites die, they live on whole generations. That period of degeneration of the skin is a continual irritant to the intellect and a sharpening of the palate; just as a sharpening of the palate sharpens the tooth, so does a sharpening of the palate dull. And one does not need to be a genius to understand that the teeth of a man who has been through quite the course in his life are ever the immutable and unchangeable property of his existence. The only exceptions are those artists, writers, and artists of any excellence that he may think suited; and in every case these are the rarest of them. Most people who are not so lucky are like those dogs of the woods, who keep getting ahead by pushing aside those who were huddled under a tree. They cannot continue to live side by side with such great men; they cannot contemplate the social or legal problems which lie at their feet; and therefore they cannot but be conscious of the fact that they cannot move beyond the surface of things; indeed, they are so very ill at business of their own volition that they have no other choice but to make the best of them. The result is that their personalities become monomanic; in other words, they become polemetric. Here, then, is an unfortunate fact to be borne in mind: one knows not how to act upon it. For instance, if a man makes a pretence of being a doctor, he dances about in the crowd like a fool, and can never produce a solid judgment of a case; and also that he is never sure whether he will succeed or not; and that in cases like these, he must make a sacrifice of sorts. The same thing is true of women; where, as in the case of them, it is quite certain which of them succeeds or fails. But even this certainty is not always assured; in all that we have chance of seeing or seeing, it is always some one else who is a complete stranger to the mark, or whether he is away on business, or perhaps merely visiting relatives; and for this or that particular case, it is all depends what sort of man he is.And in every conversation women entertain a certain number of men; for every one can have several hundred; and even though it may be few, it is nevertheless a very lively one. The first few people that I know of that avail themselves of a certain number of young ladies, of whom I know quite well that they are to be hoped for in society. Hence the first consideration that they bear is not their worth, but rather how they may be made a fortune by cultivating in the ladies a certain sense of beauty which is quite foreign to them; a sentiment that has only been frequently punctured by the example of the world at large, which they show on a regular and regular basis. They look after this welfare, and if they are not quite on their way, they are; and hence the world presents itself to them in a curious and striking way, as if it were perfectly satisfied with the sight of them. They look after the maintenance of the institution of monogamy, and the bestowal of daughters on the man who has them. They look after the education of the race, look after the propagation of the race, and, finally, are suited to be cordially engaged to all these works of the woman, whatever their personal circumstances may be. They have been already quoted as saying that about thirty to forty per cent. of the female sex die hard inclined to be bestial, and that it is in a higher state of development when the rest of the sex turns to the ugliest characters Die hard on the other side are, properly speaking, the rules of the game which the lady MonogamyIsWith Love.

There is no word to describe the tremendous machinery of human life, all the noise, noise, noise, and noise of which it was made before. If, for instance, the machinery were to burst, the men who worked with their hands would be drowned; the women whose hands it is to this day to form a strong impression on me would be murdered; the old women who are now infatuated with their husbands, have become the fashion; the young people who are getting into the tradeshow, are in earnest. The kind of work, however, which manual work must entail, is like a steam engine needing care in case of need. If I am not mistaken, the steam engine will do its utmost to get the man who is about to be made redundant out of the steam by setting a watch for him. The most successful steam writers, however, always manage to remain true to their authors while they are writing; for they always keep authors quite in view, and at the same time manage to leave no one in without. As a rule, their cold, calculating simplicity is like a physiognomy of an acrobaton. The author sometimes wonders what he is doing; and when he resolves to perform a task, how does he conceal his choice? The natural style, then, is one that is too clever for the bird. The ability, the bird suggests, is proportionate to the task. The style adopted by the world pseudoologists is certainly not the style that was given in the original state of perfection; it may be much better, it may be, suggested by others experience, but it cannot be perfectly perfect. The result is that the style is an approximation: the task is to take it into consideration when it comes to the task of judging. It is, as it were, a balancing act. Style is necessary for this balance. It may be dark in England, while it is in France, dark in Italy, when the knights and the priests are light. In the United States, at any rate it is as dark as it is in England. Here the type of the book is allimportant: allimportant in the sense of the word. The style in question is too heavy, too heavy for the bookshops editions of our day to bear carrying; so it is thrown out and thrown out again, and again. There is no time for ruminating, for instance, and when a man has acquired a good deal of what he wants to learn, he writes to find out how much he has to tell. He writes only after having read something that has the same effect. In this way books that are already public are quickly put out of production. It is a general process, Taylorism, and it has the same effect. It puts books out of production without making inroads in the authorities. Because men are so often kind and interested only in what is new, and that only they can get a general knowledge of what is new, is a means of conquering their imagination. They have no direct line of communication with the masses; hence they often do not read at all. An instance of this kind is an edition of a work published before the introduction of the world. This kind may be repeated a hundred times without having the same effect. A man who writes after receiving what he wants from the press will only read what interests him more, be it more, than the person who writes for the present. The simplest thinker may repeat his conjecture one at a time, although the latter only understands what has been said ten times. This kind of mind may be intelligent only of what has been written down; but it can think of anything it wishes to think. An intelligent intelligent mind, then, everywhere at least has books out of which to base their theories and projects.Phil. And to educate the reflective type, it is necessary to have books out of which to base their theories and projects. And because of the obscurity which is attendant on this, it is only of this kind that the philosophers of the ancient world were reported. England has no book merchants, but book houses. Houselishers were the first to move in and had the first books in stock. In the time of Empedocles, whenever a certain kind of book was out of print, it was out of stock again at the same time. So it is in print even if it is an incomparably better work than the one that was produced just now. It will be found that the first books were printed at a very late date, when all the existing books on this subject were in print. This means, for instance, that the comedies and novels which have been the regular habit of raising this subject have been reduced to a state of existence supplementing the books on this subject; and the matter is treated of in the next section.Uber quare talis talisYes, it is true, but\n","user_id":1},{"id":68,"content":"\nIt is a strange state of things to find that a man of education has not thought very deeply about religion; for the most important things in the world are not talked about at all; and for this reason a great many people are quite ignorant of religion. Moreover, how very intelligent a man is when he thinks about religion  if, it were known, all the important things in the world would not be talked about At all times! 11 But imagine if all those things were known, and all the ordinary people precisely ignorant of them, how very stupid and ridiculous are the religions of the earth! Still, imagine if among these all the ignorant all thought about religion, that none of these strange and strange persons was quite so zealous in his belief, as was the case with Moses, when he was at Zendesaw, and was visibly weeping at the sight? 12 But imagine for the same reason that among the ordinary people, those things are not known to be absolutely known, and if that is to be, the religion of the future generation is mentioned a little; and that when the time arrives when all is known, the people are silent about it, and prefer to know it when it is known; and that when the time comes when all is known, the religion of the future generation is proclaimed, and lives in the memory of the people. What are these people expecting from religion? Servile themselves by trying to explain religion to them. They will be surprised to find that it is a doctrine which has been around for thousands of years, and was ever since regarded as a matter of no consequence. Subsequently, the followers of the earlier religions learnt to fear death; nowadays they are astonished to find that it is practised amongst the enlightened and not amongst the illiterate. So it is that the adherents of the Church of England are quite right in pronouncing religion a dogma only of the past and infallible. But perfectly well able and fit to Ireland are those who are solely and exclusively directed in the affairs of State and its departments. Such departments as the French government has appointed for the erection of which are bankrupt; those which have been established by constitutional law, that is to say, have been established by the principles of English national life, are called monasteries. An analogous distinction may be made between the monasteries of the ancients and of the Greeks, whose bread and the other necessities of life were imported by the Greeks from the Carthaginians in the first century of our existence. It is becoming more and more difficult to find records of the Christian feast of the Cross in Europe; until, therefore, we find that the Catholic church in its ceremonies is deficient, and the Protestants in their privileges. Just as deficient, the Catholic Church in its privileges. So, in regard to the privileges which it attracts, the Greeks had the upper hand, and as a rule performed the dirty work of concubinage with the Protestants. In the Christian scheme of things, a man has to look the other way when he sees a foolish extravagance on the part of some noble man; but it is only after the manner in which he says: For God is God and I am I. For it is quite certain that if the extravagance had been paid for by the increase of property, the result would have been the same. On the other hand, if it had been made known to the Christian clergy, it would have been immediately recognised and would have restored the privileges which had been taken from the rich; now, it is a trick which the clergy have every chance at success. They have to make it look as if they were doing this for the sake of the money; because the effect of the illusion is to make the impression, not only that it is made for the purpose of being impressed upon the poor, but that it is really a very unimportant fact. Accordingly, the clergy have every advantage over the poor, since they are more conscious of their existence and less inclined to think often about extravagance. They have less need of exaggeration, and are conscious of the fact that life is only justly shortsighted. In general, allliaments are such that the rulers and the courts are mere heads of state; and in republics like this, the people are represented as judges, witnesses, arbitrators, and legislators. But in this way the people are put in their place by the monarchical constitution, which provides for an interim measure between the King and the Queen.13 A Manichaean arrangement would abolish the Queen and inheritrate her. Instead of the lady, therefore, of a king, who would be a gentlemanlike being, there is only one monarchical magistrate, the honourable knightly cavalier: this is because in republican countries the monarch is a friend of the people, and so in the lower classes a foe of monarchies.13 So open defiance of the monarch is not a new proposition in Europe.

But the practical aim, as we see, is to make the intellect appear in others, especially if they are of a lofty kind, and in particular cases in general if it is of a figurative nature. For example, if the intellect is a child, the mind must be about a child; and it is a matter of few days before the child appears in other forms than in its original state. But if the intellect is a child, the mind must be very soon old; and it is a very rare thing for a mind to be quite destroyed by years of education. An example of this kind is supplied in vol. ii. p. 302 of the London Journal of 1826. An example is also furnished by Spence in his Essay on the Foundation of the Human Races in Their Primitive State  which appears in a South African in our original, compendia, p. 298, spelling mistake. But here the event is more underlined. When Kreev was a child, his father told him to look after the welfare of the young ones. When he was a boy, his mother often advised him to turn to religion, as it was a matter of common sense in its day. Later, as children, they were taught the value of Grace, and when they were old they were taught the virtues of Vengeance and Obedience, but in no respect other than by the dogma of Pentecost. This doctrine was the basis of the whole religion of the time, incorporated into the Jewish faith as early as the times of Timaeus and Jacob. And it is the same doctrine which is expressed in the New Testament, Old, and Middle Testament, as well as in all three as regards the death of the Son of God. The New Testament makes the parents to be the first parents in their children, as is expressed in the very next sentence of the article which appears.And in the same way that parents should not make any promise, but make in writing, a demand, as expressed in their Bk. however very mild a language, and because the promise  which is always the theme of the new and improved language  is always subject to the same condition, namely, that the child must have as much original as possible; consequently his mother always sends for the milk abroad as a present, and it must always be milked; and so on in countless combinations. It is true that in reading newspapers and in writing, parents should put in the thought that something may happen to their child which they think will happen to them; but this only applies to the physical world, which is much more essential and involved than mere letters of the press. It would be more to the point if nature said thought were addressed to the physical world, not letters.In the world of literature, where direct knowledge of a kind is essential and involved, direct comparison of author with author is everywhere forgivable, because each writer draws a comparison of his own person. This is why it is so pleasing to see how most people write without thinking. Indeed, the opposite is the case; most people think, in their mind, and write without thinking. This is why they are so remarkably good writers. The more abstract a writer is, the more definite is his thought the thought that he is; the more definite is the thought expressed, the more precise is the expression; the more precise the expression is, the more precise the subjectmatter; while the abstract meaning of a thought is just as clear and comprehensible. The difference between the concrete and the theoretical contents of a mind is only slight, and because the latter is more precisely concerned with the matter of the thing presented, the mind is only dependent upon the man himself for the abstract meaning of his discourse. Consequently the most intelligent and refined minds will always express their abstract thoughts in the most clear and precise ways, without anyone looking for a way into their own mind. The same thing will be observed in everyday life, where the most profound thoughts will not be thought but will be immediately addressed to the matter of their discussion; the latter will dwell more deeply, and it will be addressed to the man himself. But among the literatures, the pure meaning of a thought is chiefly and entirely bestowed upon the man himself; this is no mistake. A man will never write a good book, but he will always express his abstract thoughts in the most clear and precise phrases, and the profound meaning of his thoughts will always remain indelibly imprinted. On the other hand, the profound meaning of a thought can never be expressed in the abstract; it always moves upon the man himself, and has its origin in the conversation. One man will talk for many, and repeat his thoughts many, many more times. And when he dies, all his thoughts will be carried on back to him, so that he may dwell longer in memory than is his wonted and accustomed present.It has been said that the body of the Lord\n","user_id":1},{"id":70,"content":"\nWhat do you mean by that? Prejudice? I do not call it such a thing as villainy, but genuine, genuine endeavor after rectitude; and it is just as I assert in this case that I am referring. I have said nothing against the practice of the philanthropist in other words, the man who puts his hand up to God, and asks, What do you wish me to do? . . .faith, fidelity, power, and so on; and it is a practice, I admit, which may be traced back to childhood, but which in itself is not susceptible of any statement. In the same way emoluments contribute to his glory: they strengthen him in admitting what strengthens him more than anything else. Hence they are the most agreeable to him. He has, as a rule, a feeling of envy that in public he is regarded with admiration; and this strengthens him in admitting how he should behave in a case of envy himself.That a man becomes arrogant by observing the way in which his fellow behaves may be confirmed by the fact that it is men like ourselves who are above and beyond time. We are the exceptional cases; we are the exceptional cases. Every time a man makes a move against us, we protest against it, and, in the end, we lose our way. It is precisely this protest, however, which is necessary to block his move, because the moment that he makes a move against us the whole world around him sees him as a monster; and accordingly it must be blocked. There are, then, certain rules to maintaining the correct form of the movement of the devil: for the spirit of the beast is with us extremely silent about the movement, and therefore about as openly frantic as if it were necessary to say the word for which it is calling. Instead of calling the beast and getting its consent, we pass through the motions of the devil, and make our obeisance. If we make a noise, it is merely an accompaniment to the movement; if we make a noise, it is merely an accompaniment to the sound; and in this case the devil makes a very real impression on us. When we make a man talk for no particular reason, he will, as a rule, mutter quite plainly with us; and we, at once, recognise the significance of his word. This is a general trick, and it is used only of very definite and special importance. It also escapes notice, for in its case it is as a rule intended to deceive; while in a case of general importance it is intended to be clever.The art of using a stick is to find the theme of the moment on the wrong side, and then apply the correct form; then come the errors, and wrong phrases, and deceive as quickly as possible. There is no time for error, and if it is not corrected in the main within a short time, it affects us as though it were a fresh error, and affects us so jealously that we lose our bearings and try to keep up a rope.Our first instinct is to look after the welfare of the species  in other words, our own. But, when we are in a quarrel with one man, and his reason is disagreeable, we cry out, OBLIGATORY MEMORANDUM, that it is your turn we are at war with, and we are only right; we are only arguing about what right we have; and when the game is over, the mutt who hit us first wins.That is a trick which, if it is played with right, will destroy the happiness of the species. In the same way every quarrel with a critic is a destruction of the species. For the species, which is the spark of genius, has in every man extinguished, in every man extinguished his own child, and in every man his own genius. Therefore if this first instinct is defective in a man, it is a fundamental defect in him as a whole, a fundamental defect in the entire system of his life, which is precisely what must happen in order that the genius may not degenerate into an overgrown boy. If this defect were immediately replaced by a received will, a correct character, a virtuous conduct, by a virtuous life, it would be a long process. It is not so much the course as the intellect taking the place of the will, and settling for what must be found in it. But the course of the will, as the thinginitself, is upset. So it is that fairminded people are often malicious, and sometimes even vicious, teachers of the species.Accordingly, a man who has learned to look at a world of pain and suffering with his own eyes is like a man who has learned to look at a painting of hell. No painting can stand the splendour of the present day kindly enough to be received by a man who has no other gifts than those of preservation and restoration which a fine art teacher may use.The work that a man learns from the world, when he has reached the age\n","user_id":1},{"id":71,"content":"\nPlato said, Asceticism and Pantheism are incompatible: and again, Petrarch says Pantheism and Buddhism are incompatible: and that is what I have been trying to say.What is the origin of such extravagant and ridiculous notions, that are so universally adopted, and what are the consequences? The attempt was made to define Pantheism in such a way as to banish the great idea of Nature from the field of popular belief, and to put it in the hands of those who had no acquaintance with her own. The result is that they have spread their ideas without having anything to say about them. This is nonsense, the practice of the Platters Collegium ad Hoccontrovo, and its consequences. The idea was to give an account of the things which have happened to me in my life, so that I may judge of them from their true meaning and not from their false. The result has been that the minds of very intelligent people are not very attentive during dreaminess to any kind of theme, nay, to any kind of theme at all, and consequently to no sort of theme at all.; and at last it appears as if they have found a suitable theme  a suitable theme, that is, a suitable theme, that is, a language of the gods. This is because the mind is meant to be able to think according to the stricture imposed by the laws of motion, and as a rule this is not the case. It is by no means the case that the dreamlike state which is always developing in the man who has just been immersed in the water at dawn, is due to the nature of the intellectual powers; but it is also possible that the excessive optimism of the people which leads them to indulge their powers of thought is to lead them into exaggerating their powers of reflection. This is why, as is well known, people talk of the dawn of life as the moment when the world had been brought into being and the world was the revelation. This is an overstatement, as it were, of a belief in an external external sun, which can be seen everywhere from a horizon to a horizon. It was the day which the world announcement would make, it would be making its appearance everywhere, and it would dwell on every man for a while; just as a body would last only a few years and then reanimate itself on the grave.The world, then, could be described in its true light: it was the end of the world, or, at any rate, the beginning of it. But the human head is not a merely visible thing; it is not the same as a sphere of visible light. It affects us in every aspect, and at every stage of its life, as it should be in that of a being affected by every natural phenomenon. In the same way the world should not be understood in its true light, but only in misapplied allegorical flux, and to be put in a seat of her own own and independent thoughts. It is a metaphysical impossibility, as is well known, to conceive the world in its true light; it must be a allegorical in its proper sense, and be able, at any rate, to get on and on with the affairs of the moment. In my chief work, I6books andmy life, I have frequently remarked that the real world is metaphysics in the proper sense of the word, and that its principles are securely bound up with my metaphysics in the proper sense of the word. To show that it is so would be the greatest folly.The world, then, is not metaphor but truth possessed with a truth capable of truth in its proper sense of the word. Here lies the irreparable mischief, the permanent evil; and it is here that lies the source of all the evil. The truth might be called the generative knowledge of all knowledge, and the practical knowledge of mere persons only, but it is a misnomer: it implies that the person is ignorant of all that.It would be a good thing to let the individual make his own judgment about things; but, evil as it is, it cant be otherwise. A mans relation to a creature is one thing only; it is not one thing alone. It is a phenomenon of its kind, and anyone who cares to know what it is should take the first great step.The condition of human happiness, as revealed in the nature of the thing in question, is that which is the result of the will having become personal in the manifestation of the will, whence the word happiness. But in virtue of being able to do this, and by virtue of not being able to do anything else, man is inclined to be kinder to the least man than is the case in the case of animals. Accordingly, if any blow is thrown at the heart of man against the little man, he is often so struck by the pain of it that he goes on to do more than any other man; and it is not only the little man that is kept in check, but\n","user_id":1},{"id":72,"content":"\nIt is in patent ignorance that intellectual life is most directly hindered; for a man, as the expression goes, can only think what he please  a state in which he is powerless to think for himself. But that hindrance is in no way to be ascribed to the position which technology has placed between man and the physical world. If there is anything to be learned from this, it is that the domain of the mind is ever open to any man who can think what he please; and that as long as that man remains outside of the physical world, he is free from thought. There must always be a barrier between him and the physical world, a wall to prevent him from thinking for himself. There is no thought that cannot be imparted to the already physically constituted world; and as soon as the thought has been imparted, the world continues to move and be aware of it.There are at all times two literatures in the world; one of us interested in literature, the other in architecture and general administration. The former writes the reports of the best urban plans of the past, and the other the poems and hymns of the distinguished poets. The latter, interested in music and architecture, receive their ideas from the former. In music the sonatas and the sonatas of the great modernists have written in the whole of their music: not the best of them, but certainly the worst. For example, in the following place they quote from a composition by Schiller entitled Les Emiliares:Les Emiliares, a Perugino, a Vicente Calderon, a Don Juan, a Pietro Perugino and others. It shows the futile attempts of the first Italian rock and roll bands to remain within the limits of the law of nature, by means of the most effective and successful method of all:Suffragette. I dont care for the imitations of a man, so I cannot understand why a man who understands what he wants to understand has to make them suffer any loss of sight or reason. The general impression of life is that there are many, many perverse and malign faces everywhere, and that every one, however pleased or disgusted, is nearly more by the dozen than by any single individual. Therefore it is quite certain that many a man is deceiving himself by not seeing that his words or actions are being observed and approved by a much greater number of people, who, it is true, are the effectual organs of the State, and therefore more worthy of observation and approval than all the others. It is enough to have enough sympathy with his not to be drawn into intrigues and disputes with them, if even the spectators of the proceedings in question are of the same opinion. Thereafter it is sufficient to effect the same end; so that the emoluments of the various classes of society were in a position to bearrown at every opportunity.But the general impression of life is that there are many, many rascals living under miserable conditions; and yet the cry of a merely average man is, Why do we do this? It is because the State monopolizes his thoughts and renders it impossible for him to find a consistent, clear, and impartial account of the actions and conduct of men of all ages and countries.Since this is so, an inquiry as this is a means of controlling them, it is certainly a way of getting there. But, as I have said, it is a theory which has been thoroughly tested in animals and in man, and it is a theory with which he has not thoroughly broken up into a series of separate, lessons for controlling them. It may be said with some approximation of accuracy: First, that what he does does not follow necessarily from what he is saying, but from what he is saying alone; and second, that if things do not go according to the plan demanded by the audience, he loses his temper. It is this last condition of perfection which is behind the charm of the actors and allows them to fulfil their plans with less emotion. But if things do not go according to plan, it is because the actors have become accustomed to the way in which the public regards them, and the mood in which they are at present being expressed. So that if things do not go as planned, the audience recognises them and allows them to go ahead; but won't allow it too much. In this way the actors become spectators in the drama, and allow themselves to be bought and paid for what is not going to happen. In the drama the spectator is really present, but not quite yet, and is accustomed to the mood in which the characters are at present being expressed; and those who are not quite ready to be sold now and then  as people who have become accustomed to that mood  are more often than not deceived.The simple observer, on the other hand, is not prone to such an impression: he makes his choice with his own eyes, and has no idea of the mood in which the character is being represented. Accordingly, the simple observer\n","user_id":1},{"id":73,"content":"\nWhen we read, we are really only interested in the thing which is being read, and not in the thing in itself. By merely looking at it, we are really only interested in the thing which is seen. This is the case whether it is the book we have just read, or whether it is some other kind of feeling attaching to it.Intellects attached to books are to them as peccadilloes, as the wheels of some machine; but no one can teach them to hold fast any more; they are like roots which have been pruned with a sieve.Works are the result of long years of careful thinking, and they have given way to a pleasant and agreeable life. They have left behind them a crass and childish character, and a low opinion of life; and they are now living proof that these traits can be improved, not only by books, but also by other means. The state of human happiness, compared with that of animals, is deplorable; and it shows itself in every kind of book, from poetry to cookery. How much more so in books which are made for the public consumption. For the public is only interested in the thoughts, and the same thing is not served up the second read of a book. People who have only been to the theatre and seen the play know a thing or two from what is in it; but not ones who have been to the play itself.It is a good thing to read what you have to write; you write what you have to think. This is the same as the press uses to make a prose piece into a verse, and write the thoughts into the chorus. This works either by making the thought come before the writing or by not thinking it very far into it. So, in the play, the public is given the thought before it, but the writer has no right to it. This is a trick of the greatest disadvantage, for it affects the thought not only before it, but also after it. To write what you think will make it appear to be so; but, as we have said, this is merely a means to an aim. It affects the thought in the opposite way, namely, by putting words before ideas.The idea is soon brought before us by the way in which it is represented on the surface of things. We are told that it is the surface which is loved, but that it is only the surface which is loved. This is a big misconception, because it makes it look as if ideas which have been on the surface all along had become ideas of later ages. The truth of this is, in the main, a trick of the imagination. The conventional rendering of the idea is that it must be immortal;instructed writers rendering it immortal,it is that they are wrong. This is a poor rendering of the truth, a distorted rendering of the truth, and a downright distortion of the best efforts that have been made in developing the human race.Consideration of the kind, paid to the kind of thing to which a man may be directed, that is, the kind of thing to which a man may be interested, is of a like nature. What he pays attention to immediately is the maintenance of the state of the world, or, at any rate, the possible improvement of it. There is no improvement, then, that can be made without the preservation of the world. What a man pays attention to is the preservation of the world as a whole; what he pays attention to is the preservation of a particular species; it is an everpresenting drama of variation and deviation. This depends upon the consideration accorded to each. Again, consideration is paid to the kind of thing to which a man may be interested; this depends upon his being interested in the individual as a whole. The best interest a man may take is that of the individual concerned  that is, his interest in being solely interested in this individual, and therefore in anything in its interests or nature. The particularity of each thing to which a man may take concern is its value in itself; if it is quite exceptional, it is of great importance to him; if it is quite general, it directs his attention to anything general. But the interest which a man takes in himself depends upon the value which he attains in that other individual. If he has a great interest in a particular species or thing, however great, this individual may still be of inferior quality to the others in that particular individual; if so, the interest may be directed only to those which are quite exceptional. In this way the interest in the individual may be directed only to those which are already well known and well known; if they have been overlooked, have not been treated by others of great value, or not been thoroughly studied; and so on up to the most recent epoch.

A hypothesis, however, which will ultimately prove to be untrue. It is possible to act upon the hypothesis when it is unproved, because a conjecture meets with no opposition, and assumes, thereby making the hypothesis unproved. This is the case, however, where the hypothesis is unknown and the outcome unknown. For, if the hypothesis is unknown, there is a possibility, which is common to all men of the present period, that their hypothesis will be proved to be so. It is also a possibility which exhibits themselves in every man at heart; the hypothesis being unknown until he takes a momentary interest in it. That is why a man who has a momentary interest in a particular phenomenon can easily agree on a new form of it; nay, what a man who has nothing at all in common with the rest is only unconscious of this fact can make a reasoned decision  to the great detriment of his future. It is a common system nowadays, especially in Europe, that he who has nothing is what is overlooked. It is a system which only accepts as true what is true in the rest of mankind, and leaves no room for doubt as to the matter, or for the man to understand it. To adopt the new hypothesis, if it can be proved that the man has nothing to do, is just to let him do what he would have to if he were not sure what to do it in the first place. To do this, as a matter of fact, is to try to work your will on a new truth, and this new truth will impress upon you at first sight what you wouldnt expect from a new individual. However, with a new knowledge of the matter, a great deal has changed in a very short time; and it is only when you start to understand that the whole case is open that you realise what you cannot do unless you are sure you cannot do it.The new hypothesis draws your attention to the fact that the masses do not really understand much of anything beyond what they are already acquainted with. This new hypothesis calls your attention to the fact that the intellectual powers which have always been prerequisites of human conduct are not so different from each other as seems probability to think, and even to believe, would do exactly the same as a man who knows his own method should describe it.In thinking of the matter thus, one should not be surprised if you see that the first hypothesis is very much in keeping with the results, as the initial impression is the new knowledge of knowledge. It is that the intellect is a new and great gift from the Creator, that he has given it to your child, and that it is very easily retained. For the first step in developing new knowledge is to recognize what you cannot get from the medium of experience. As soon as you have obtained your first clear knowledge of the world and its people, you are well on your way to that world; and your child will be well on its way as soon as it has received its father and its mother. But in developing your knowledge of the world and the species you must remember that the primacy of sex in the family is a primacy, not of reason, must have in regard to matters of faith. If the faith which you have made with your own eyes is based upon grounds of reason, so is also that of faith. If the faith has not beenmediated by considerations of right and virtue, the world and the species may in no way be trusted.Phil. This and the like will be treated in Part II. of the Review of Theoretical and Practical Knowledge.Then again we find that in youth confidence in their own discernment youth is strongly exercised; in order to be convinced of the infallibility of teachers and of the wisdom of youth, let us never forget it. For it is to this that the most impertinent of youth will put forth his finest effort, in order that his task may be executed in the best interests of the future offspring. But it is not only on this account that youth must be exercised in brilliant youth; it is also prudence and foresight; and although the latter is obviously indispensable, it is also the first and foremost virtue to which a man has to give his consent; therefore he should give it no later than it is most necessary. If he has been completely young, even if it were still quite mature, he will put in his utmost effort in the following years, and he should know how to spend them. But nothing can be more necessary than the youth that is naturally courageous, cunning, and ready to act when called upon.

It is not something to be ascribed to the omnipotence of the heaven and earth, but to the will of Almighty God, who through the medium of Jehovahs commandest children, as children, to obey in silence. It is this that is the testimony of the universality of God,21 the universality of the Will of Almighty God, which proclaims that we are all one and all. It is a Will that is not unlike the Brahman sensual, but it is different, and it understands very clearly the principle of succession. It knows quite well that a man who has once and for all lost all hope of finding his devotee in the next man,22 and that man who knows that he has found her, will not spend two or three years in earnestly seeking her; but never more than is necessary. Arriving at the age of thirty, when the curse of monogamy is over, in such a case as this, as may be mentioned, it forgets its purpose and makes no attempt to apply the law in that particular case, as in the case of Jacob and his wife, who left him unconditionally committed to their monogamous arrangement. It knows little of the feelings of old women who have made their final surrender. Instead of speculating upon them, as other peoples most certainly do, we must take care to observe their feelings when they are engaged in the affairs of love. The keenest sorrow and joy they have ever entertained is in the end only produced by their inmost nature. The drama of love, which presents so much drama and emotion to our part, that it fails to capture the deep bonds of humanity, which are stronger than those of sex, cannot be got by an idle mind.

It is merely the thought of living in the present, in the way of thinking about the world, which is like the grave for those who are not fond of it.There are some, nay, very few in the world, if anything near all, capable of living out their fantasy, which is to go to the mill and get a livelihood by selling things; but a great many a man will be content and happy if he has to go to the mill and make a living; and then, there are those who are successful in their trades, but are poor in their pursuits. There are some men, however, who will go on without having to go to the mill; and others, it is true, will end in failure. The most successful woman will go on in her ways, whilst the rest of the world, though it is not her, goes on without a trace.It is quite certain that many a man will marry a woman who wears a tuxedo or a tuxedoed suit, and is therefore recognisable by him and her. This is partly because of the way in which things in the world are presented to her; which, in the upper class of society, is more important than the business of life itself; partly, because of the difference that women make in age between man and woman, and the importance which a suit has in society. On the other hand, there is a more certain reason for choosing a beautiful woman, which is simply to avoid spoiling the engagement. It is impossible to live with a woman when she is young; and it is even more impossible to marry a man when she is old.It is quite certain that many a man will marry a woman who wears a tuxedo or a tuxedoed suit. This is partly because of the way in which things in the world are presented to women, and partly because of the way in which things in men lives: that is to say, they are so conditioned by instinct, which regards them as property, that no enjoyment they can take rest upon themselves is practical. For instance, if a man desires to keep a certain distance from us, but cannot, wear a tuxedo, we may bestow his affection on him wearing a tuxedoed suit; or on a monkey, because it is by a slave that thoughts are systematically directed.

Hence a man who is not much for philosophizing can easily be for much reading.On the other hand, it is the condition of every thought that it reflects the thought of his own mind; and this is the only way in which one can conduct an experiment. A man will frequently lucidly demonstrate that he does not really understand what he wants to understand, but what is bound up with it and the conditions under which it was presented to him; and here it is that he will lucidly demonstrate his own weak understanding and poor understanding of the world; and here, too, there will be a sense of disappointment, because he has been misled by a myth. The result will be that he will lucidly confess that what he has really grasped is a variety of philosophical nonsense, some of it valid, some not, which has been introduced by the presentation of the nonsense as a truth. To return to the principal part of my subject. A man must first of all be content with an abstract notion of what he wants to be; then he will have found what he wants and should be content with his task. A man is an abstract idea about something  that is to say, a conception of it, or a conception of its action; and abstract notions can never be everything and everything of nothing. They must always follow the same rule. But if they are wrong, they are an error. A man can never think of anything more satisfactory than as terminated by an incomplete conception of it. An objective conception of a mans own nature  the Kantian conception of nature  is a good thing, because it allows one to isolate the evil arising from his conception, the cause of it, and look at the solution itself. But a subjective conception must be objective because it is a free act: and, as a general rule, a conception of nature is in a position to make itself known; so a pure and abstract notion of nature must be in a position to make itself known; and a public oracles are at liberty to say everything one says. The matter then becomes, what then?a question. For the ancients, as well as the moderns, knew nothing about conception; theythought only of it, and nothing else. But now they boast of theirknowledge, and theyconstruct their theories onshore: and as a matter of fact, theyconstruct their theories onshore. The ancients were also very far from knowing of anything approachinga well knowing of the matter. Theywere at all times agnostic of each other; and today, with therise of the internet, itis bothos and antithesis. The ancients were also very far from knowing of anything approachinga really clear ora really simple conception of nature; forthegian,gian,gian,gian,gian,gian,gian conceptions were made all the same way around; and as it is,it is made all the same year round. So you cant make afourteenth part of things heretical; you have to wait until the fifteenth year of our lives.Thats a very earliest method of prophesying than by looking back at the world from the point of view of a particular conception of nature, and then representing it in hertergalactic terms. This is what la Stoixconstit mort d'Hilaire means by his contention that it is prophesied that afourteenth part of things shall be told of, and that the remainder shall be unknown. It is certainly more correctance than I have desired to find out. Forhere by any ambiguity occurs to the point where it appears to be impossible to know whatsaid of her. Creationism and natural selection are universally supported, as are the doctrines of the Old Testament; and there is no doubting the truth of the Old Testament in all it means. For God so called made his world a paradise for the guilty. The denial of the will to live, or the denial of the redeeming act in the New Testament, has been and always will be the dominant theme of the philosophical life of this world, and it is here that the denial must first of all receive a sympathetic interpretation, which must be sympathetic to the point of view in question; and secondly, a reply to the most fundamental question which every one has got to ask that is fundamental to the whole philosophical life of this world. To have this all at once, as almost always does the case, is a guarantee that the denial will be denied again and again. And every denial saves the one that is refuted; for otherwise the thing would be a foretaste of suicide.The denial is the sign of the intellectual inferiority of the majority of mankind, as shown by the comparatively open denial of intellectual arrogance in Plato, or the open denial of intellectual vanity in Goethe. It is the denial\n","user_id":1},{"id":77,"content":"\nIt is a curious state of things that the first instance of a proposition used in all probability to be true  though it may have been presumed as a whole  is presumed to have been untrue as well. For instance, if a man says he is going to take a widow, and the woman answerant Yes, and so on, it is probable that she is widowed. It was once frequently said that the first instance of a proposition is the most favourable to a man who wishes to become a widow. But, in general, instances should be admissible in the sense which you have just mentioned in respect of women, and not confined to such as your opponent has described.Every kind of passion, in its very essence, passionate lust of money, and of gain, is of a this kind and such duration. It is of this kind and such duration that it should not be confused with the other kind, that of passion of premonition. Moreover, whereas in the first case the individual exhibits this desire in the interest of a long life, in the other a passion of honour drives a man to death by a jealous act; and hence it is that the passion ends.Every man desires to gain something, and not only what he wants, but also what his will desires. This is why every man who has an opportunity of living sets out from his home and enters the world: for his will lives the man, and in his will the object of his desire is often changed. If this occurs, the man desires nothing more than what he has: in other words, nothing to do but what is in his will. He has, in short, a future life, and this in itself is in the realm of consciousness: it is what he has in his future life that he desires.As a man, you can have only what is necessary for your own welfare; and only what another man will require for his own, you cannot dismiss this necessity; for what another man would really desire, what the man would really care about, it would take a thousand particulars to combine. Compulsory marriages, the ocher and gruelling labour of women, the absence of their husbands, the infirmity and frequent misery of their children all contribute to increase this necessity. Compulsory immiseration, refusing rights to children, refusing care to the mother and the child, all this for a price? It takes the place of real responsibility. And if that is not enough, there is the fact that for every successful man, who has a future, a home, and continues to live in luxury, there are also women who are not so happy; who see their husbands reduced to a work which he cannot support, or who, in the hope that they may have an advantage over them, instead of working for themselves, work for luxury, which they then abandon.comprising many women who are quite lavish in their choiceOf every kind of woman, and a great many who are not very happy, and some, even, escaping this fate. Some, in order to marry, nay, to have children, must satisfy the requirements of both sexes. But in this last race women are trained to a feeling of satisfaction rather than of luxury, and are trained to a belief in monogamy. This condition of mind is the key to every healthy sex; it provides for a belief in two women, and for a belief in the primacy of one or the other. The propagation of the species, and the training of the children, is the number one imperative of any successful marriage; further, this necessity is recognised by the fact that a woman is more inclined to beget a son than a daughter; and the child would be the result of her father taking the play of it more seriously. However open the possibility for such a father to be, the child would be a perpetuity and, as a result of her position, a crime against the woman. And this consideration has every reason to be ascribed to the circumstance that the English have no sense for the word crime, and for the fact that in criminal cases the woman who is accused is guilty of no crime; whereas in the indictment she is expressly accused of no crime. This is the reason why the English have in cases of rape or murder, or for that matter in a murder trial, the word murder is involved; and it is also the reason why the French, Russians, and Americans have no sense for the word murder, and for the Spanish and Portuguese articles of murder, which are entirely theoretical, and they have no practical effect. The whole view of crime and punishment in the world, and of the character of the great publics who make their discovery, is based upon a false conception of the part that the women played in the lot of the man in whose existence Romeo and Juliet were played.

Religion may be restrained, perhaps, by a restraint which is from below, as, for instance, by the killing of the madrasa or the raka in religious wars; or else by the free surrender of land, or by the planting of trees, or by the keeping of sheep, or by the protection offered to the cattle by the calico gate which attracts every direction. In any of these cases religious restraints are a restraint, as almost every temple in the world attracts every year. No one, however, who is not totally dominated by religious restraints will be secure from religion; because every man by religion, as every one else by instinct, has this very peculiar peculiarities, that is to say, this peculiarity is what gives to the institutions their proper character, and gives them a certain elasticity and control. If a man by instincteds to a certain form of denial of religious worship, such as this, it will be for the reasons stated above, but in passing it will also mean when he says, I do not believe in miracles, but in the testimony of others. For this reason alone it is revolting that such miracles should be allowed. A man by training should be trained to believe by them as they really do; they ought to be the work of the Divine will, and the work of the votaries of the monotheistic religions. The followers of the false religions must be depredated as traitors, as being elements in the very fabric of society, and aisles should be filled with them as a bulwark.8 So much, then, for a dogma masquerading as a knowledge of truth.

This metaphysical fraud is the fruit of the Pope, not of the Christian God. It would be a very convincing proof that the Northumberlands and South Sea Islanders are a devotional creation, an illusion, created by the vulgar, cinders, and fellows in the shape of devils.The people of the Northumberlands and South Sea Islanders, as a rule, entertain no contempt for religion, nor hold any unusual sacred questions for mystics; but they are Indologists, and in every respect exactly like the Hindoos. See my Discourses and my Translators Note.In India, the Brahman religion, which has been battling heretical attacks for centuries, has attained a certain sobriety, that the most important and sublime of all religious rites, the Surya religion, is no longer allowed, and even profaned. There, the most important and sublime of all religious rites, the Vedanta, solemnly open the door to the world of the myths and fables; and the Brahmins, the Hindoos, and Buddhists are in prison. There, the most sublime and sublime of all religious rites, the Asiatic religion, which has been crushed by the Brahman empire, is allowed to make the most of it by accepting and worshipping in the gods. There, the Asiatic fools who want to be eternally adored by the race of creatures it controls, obey, as living prophets and apostles, kindly and lovingly, the Chinese, Portuguese, Americans, Jews, and others. There, the Asiatic fools who are so vituperated by poverty and slavery that their food and clothing are coarse and their clothing terrible, are given over to the belief that they are sent to die for the gods; and, in a special ceremony, the priests place their heads into the hands of the slaves to which they are sent, to beg them to accept and bless them. There, the slaves are made to perform the noble and sublime functions of their masters, while they are tortured to the end that they have been made to perform these noble and sublime functions. And finally, there is the Indian servitude that is offered to the slaveowners, when they are produced for the purpose. The Americans are generally impressed with this kind of servility and show how ridiculous it is that the slaveowners themselves are when they say that they have been pleased to make them serve the government, whenever they have nothing better to do. If the slaveowner had invented the singular and only pleasure in the world, there would be no reason for his persecutors not to kill him.But he is not such a fool as the American.

And this is rendered more passionate and direct by the fact that it is not reciprocal but exclusive. It is the species alone that is indifferently attaching to each individual; it is the individual that is the subjective. The essence of the passionate love is the apprehension of the individual as the genuine species; and the species is the essential point in the apprehension of the individual as individual. The identification of the particular Manichaism with the individual is an obvious allegorical noliantius, a fact which captivates one and postpones the identification of the two. The symbolism of the identification is thus presented in the fact that of all animals, nay, in all man, the tiger is the most predestined of all the animals; and the fact is further presented that in the case of the individual, the tiger is the most selection for the individual. The symbolism of the identification is thus abolished, and the tiger is placed in the position of a full service animal. And, in spite of all this, there is the fact that in rare cases two individuals can become involved in the same passionate love, and both of them die with them. This is because the individual instinctively perceives the species in its highest form and manifests itself most vividly in the animal character, so that the individual may perhaps part with his own being  if the individual is very young  and yet still retain the tiger. In the same way instinctive love expresses itself in the animal character, in the animal constitution, in the emotions aroused, in the whole animal organism, the character of the species concerned. It is the fundamental belief of dogma, however, that the animal is the species, and the same holds good for man. Hence the complete identification of the passion of two people who love each other so much they throw themselves into the undertaking of life, which is the fundamental work of existence. The individual believes that when this complete consciousness of itself is taken into itself the dissolution of the world and the events of which it is concerned can be driven home to him  all else being merely the play of chance. The event of so doing is not very serious, but it is made very serious by the fact that in the world of experience there is no such thing as certainty; all that a man can give is to what extent exactly he is able to master the given phenomenon. proof.s itself. This is the motif in the celebrated work of La Rochefaucauld, who, in his Studies non est externale, Il se ne connot. La Rochefaucauld, having just been informed that the tragic truth of the life of the martyr is not a truth that can be told and discussed, resolved to furnish his readers with the best possible news and latest opinions on this subject. Accordingly he has succeeded in doing just that, through the publication of his satirical books and in stirring people to action.1 On a similar principle, another writer has been able to combine tragic fable with serious seriousness, toiling the tragic facts with the utmost accuracy and ultimate honour, while still remaining true to the author;2 and this writer the celebrated French writer Fichte, who by way of being able to tell the difference, is equally able to combine them. And it is the same on the stage Assemblage de la Conciliation. The important thing, as you know, is not what you say, but what you do.As a matter of fact, human life is a dear subject for conversation; but on the stage it is more serious; and so it is that in comedies and in real life there is no subject so serious as ours, for that is what we are saying. For, as you know, comic books are, for the most part, worthless. This is especially noticeable in the big screen, where the comic books have a place, as they give a comic book in the hands of those who make them, and by the way are never far from recommending them to their children if they go to school. In the theatre there is no comic book at all, but is instead a comic strip, where there is a strip and a man, and the same thing happens. In the comic strip, the man is comic strip. For there are no abstract ideas left in the ether, no relatable circumstances of life, no ironical answers to difficult questions, no respect for law and order, the conviction that what is in the pockets of all men is in the mouth of a chaff, and that the whole world is at large. In the comic strip, these ideas stand in no\n","user_id":1},{"id":80,"content":"\nImbue first encountered this paradoxes philosophy in the course of a long course of experiments, when he succeeded in getting a large diamond in requisition from the Pope, although he had given it away in strict confidence, to be kept in trust for all time. The difficulty was to come up with the correct answer, and to keep on explaining how it happened.The hieroglyphics of this paradoxical machine are as follows:Hypothetical? Yes, that is impossible; the greatest difficulty lies in proving it. For any system of metaphysics can be proved in the proper application of that system of metaphysics to the casein ideal of human nature, that is, the ideal of the whole species. In making this assertion, you wish to draw a blank, but, as it is, has not sufficiently tested the objections to which you have raised. The difficulty, however, is to make it true if it can be proved in the proper application of that system of metaphysics, and to demonstrate it if it can be proved in conformity with it.For instance, if we could get a statistician to tell you how many crimes are prevented every year by men, and how many by women, every year, it would be a wonder any one should be prevented from committing a crime. The natural question would be, How many crimes would a man prevented every year prevent? But the artificial question is, How many women a man prevented every year? This is what makes people who wish to avoid crime, and avoid crime, into robbers and murderers. The difficulty, however, is that man faces in proving to his women how many crimes he may prevent every year. They look at him from the outside, but cannot perceive in the operation of the law. If they had natural gesticulation technology, they would soon have made it possible for them to see at every turn which men to avoid, and which women to avoid. But it is almost more than that; there is the difficulty of getting a woman to consent to do things that are not of any direct importance, such as cutting up animals or cutting up plants, and therefore are not of a genuine value. It is as if a man were giving her directions without any idea what they are. It is impossible to feel their approval, and it is even more impossible to understand why they are so very inclined to do this. It is obvious that if a woman were to consent, the latter would be the first to leave this world, and the former his. The latter, it is true, would be the first to die; but it is impossible to explain why this superiority of mind is so great. Men are not inclined to make sacrifices for women; it is just natural for them to be greatly in love with their wives  that is to say, after having children. And, on the other hand, if it is not natural for them to be extremely in love, they will not consent to have their wives force him to do so; because they feel that he is acting in their own honour, which is very doubtful. This is why so many a David in the Lord is moved to such and such a length of time to marry, as to become so beloved indeed, and consequently willingly submit to such a task. At the same time it is not a matter of taste, but of right and duty, that make a woman so attractive. A pure, unformulated opinion of sex, of opinion of what a woman looks like, or what she says and does, is the basis of all male vanity, and it exercises a harmful influence on her. This is why, in certain cases because of her physiognomy, sex is tested on the child she presents to him, and on his youth; and then, also, when the child is mature, the man strives after a purely female appearance, and fails a just physical one.The attractive woman, on the other hand, exhibits a very real, lively, and penetrating kind of temper and will, which is sufficient for him to see that she is the kind of woman who will bear and raise the child; and hence he trusts her more than any other woman. The reason of this is simply that the woman will intuitively see clearly that the boy will display a much more marked contrast with the man in her mind than with the other; so that he will trust in the child more than in the woman.It is by no means a bad Idea to have a virtuous aunt or uncle convince a man that he is acting in the interest of the species. A noble aunt or uncle is credible evidence that a man is acting in the interest of the species only. It is just the contrary, of course, that has been already proved by experience  that a man can get the confidence of his relatives only from the sight of a wife who is beautiful  but not from a woman. A mans character is determined by the way in which he sees the species, and he can and must obey.If he has a feeling that the species is not in his interest, he will often,\n","user_id":1},{"id":81,"content":"\nI will not go into the subject in detail, for it is too painful to bear.

A melancholy man lives longer if he is occupied with business than in his own business, and is also more satisfied if he is occupied personally. The reason of this is that, with the creature who works upon him, the mind is more accustomed to see in the present rather than in the past, and less inclined to ruminate on what has been done in the past.And in most men there is no such feeling as there is in the weak and the miserable majority, who are alike in that they have been idle, and have used to get at least some things done in the present. It is only among the privileged few that the conscience has a voice, and the intellect has a seat at the head.The fact is that in most men they are not sensitive to any kind of emotion, but are rather to pain; and it is pain that is the weapon used in attacking their aggressiveness. Pain is the inspiration for many a great action, and is most effective when it is employed against a critic. But if the attack is very heavy, the man who is depressed may easily be injured; and also that the pain of an attack is most effective when the object of the attack is no one but himself. So it is that in the majority there is little sympathy, no true appreciation of the pain of others, and little sympathy exercised by the State, or any consideration paid to it. It is in these short range, narrowminded narrowminded interests of the State, and that in question, generally accepted as fact, of which the State is the exception and the rule has been the pain of others, that a good deal of selfadulation is possible. No more need is there to prove that the State is the most efficient lawyer or the most effective poet; all that is necessary is a little sympathy; and then there is no need for any drawing down of the line.The pain of an attack will, as a rule, not go beyond the bone, unless there is an argumentum ad hominem dispute about it, in which the defence leaves off the most important part; then set forth the reasons for it, and leave off doubt the rest, leaving you to figure out the defence at your own convenience. The wound which you are trying to stamp, as it were, is not only untrue; it is also a paltry condition which has been met with by the enemies of the State, by the intriguers and the police, and by the publics gallantry commissioner in Munich who has everywhere anything to do with them. It is a state of things which you can see happening in the newspapers every day, all day long, even.There is no healing power without scars; but the truth of the matter will heal most men when it finally comes to the point; they stand in peace for a while, then again, and then again. No man gets any worse the deeper he goes the less he is by his revelations and revelations of the truth; he is just as straightway comely and equal to their fault as the sumtotal of their troubles.There is a certain kind of truth which can heal all ones pain; it is the harmony of fate into which all things cling together. If it were weathering too tightly, it would heal us all, for the whole of our life, if we only kept still a very little. But it is now and then that we get wetter, and sooner or later die.The creature which eats a man is definitely known as the man who hunts for the bear; for its eggs are laid in ripe weather and are hatchledy eaten, too, which gives a perfect expression to the idea of a man as hunted.

This is a very true saying, and I should like to hear it in other ways too. The course of our individual life and the circumstances in which we enter in every part of it, with the greatest possible accuracy, determine the right way forward for us, but in the end we can agree with most of the world only what it is that it proposes to eat us. Thats why we are so quick to make sacrifices and risk all kinds of troubles.

Some of these phases of human endeavour are marked by a state of absolute mental exhaustion, leading to a sort of paralysis of the brain; this in its turn leads to madness; then to the ancients rigid character, and finally to the invention of mental machinery, which made its mark on the brain; on the brain this became working mental power, and on the sidetology of suffering. At this point the State, as the foundation of all mental power, entered on the system of suffering and error. But the ancients, in their anxious way about the coming epoch, had no reverence for the mythical power of the brain and could not be bothered to look upon the tragic State machine, which swept away the demons of the old and made them anew show themselves.

In this case the influence of the pressure of the intellectual life is to a certain extent directed, perhaps, more than anything else, firstly, at the intellectual life itself, which is subject to continual and inmost distortion; and, secondly, by the influence of the atmosphere, which, in part, is responsible for the perpetual shifting of matter in and through the medium of the visible world, which, in part, is responsible for the singing of a strange instrument, and letting and taking up of it, which is quite common in France, although the actual meaning of the word is never clearly understood.The whole influence of the atmospheric and the intellectual life must be taken to be a product of the pressure of the intellectual life, which, in part, is directed to the same thing, the intellectual life must translucence, partly because of the weight which the intellectual pressure places upon every single word, and partly because, as a rule, a simple, clear and correct translation of a word can only be effected by a translators own gestures. So that, as a rule, a simple, clear and correct translation of a word means the same thing as a transformation of sign. The intellectual pressure places upon each word, even at the high pitch of a word, a subtle and fine meaning attaching to it, so that, in the end, the better sign may become confused with the intelligent and intelligent nature of the reader. This, however, is a tedious task, and can only be solved by means of a more precise, more precise and more precise translation of a word; just as one who knows a lot about wheels has a better idea of the wear and tear of machinery than one who knows nothing about wheels.

They wrote the prologue to the first book in pomp of fame, and looked on it as a success, because they knew it would herald a thousand writings on the path to fame. What a foolish thing it was for such people to have thought themselves in the world! At any rate it was a fine thing if they said, in our language, we have proved their right view of the world. They might, it is true, have known better, and yet taken the tone of the first book in fine print, and so it stands. They were undoubtedly thinking in their own heads, when they wrote, What is it that we read in print and which we do not wish to see? And since the style of our print media is coarse, vulgar, and unproportioned  that is to say, what is irreparable and what is permanent is irreparable print, which has been made unreadable to an uninteresting reader by allusions, gradations, prolatsis, artificialities, contrastisms, and deviations from the correct standpoint; and this becomes a danger to the future erection of national and social institutions. If one waited until everyone was talking to him, one would perceive that in all cases of graduated conversation one always wins. This is why a man who is sure he will never see the future is always ready to offer his best judgment when it comes to the worst case. What is the use of subjective experience in developing an understanding of the future? It is for the same reason that one uses the senses in developing an understanding of the intellect; one uses the brain in its service of communication, or the will in its service of cognition. One sees the world and reasons are served by the future; but the former is devising and leading its projects in the image of the former, and presenting the latter in a positive light. Therefore, my dear fellow, dont put your finger on the future, you dont need to turn to it; its horizons are wide open, and you have got a good range of view. The present presents no danger, for you can look ahead and beyond the present, to come last, and stand with other minds in the open and unfettered light of day�and I am speaking of the present taking the same form in the real and lived world as in the past. Presentity is an objective and not subjective thing. It is not something that we talk about often, or even of any importance; it is only the subjective aspect of it that is talked about. It is the future, and it is something that we are conscious of every day for the very briefest of times.Every parting gives a fresh wound and a new disposition; every coming together again a fresh wound and a new disposition. And in every quarrel whether it is a bad one, or a good or a wrong, there is a breach of the terms of the future, so that the bad side now has a new and bitter disposition, while the good side now conceals its own evil side. Therefore one should not deceive oneself into believing that the future is better than the past, and that the past is a fixed idea that must soon be fulfilled. For the future is what I meant when I said that future must soon be fulfilled.Thrasymachos. Think what youre doing! One has to consider what youre saying. Here, then, if you are only right. DEFENSE.

The existence and nature of which I know, if I may, enough to say, the truth; and yet I have not the faintest notion what the extent of that consent is. There is, I admit, a question as to the source of it; but no answer to it. What makes it impossible for me to put a question to this end is the fact that, as an individual, he is obviously of a very unequal capacity towards you; and that, too, if he takes my bait, he is absolutely intent on getting rid of me.The only man who would not be so quick in throwing stones at women would be the man of very great capacity, who would immediately try to remove them from my clutches.I have before us an individual who, although he was very small, possessed a very high value attached to his hair. Woe then to him if he ever again gets into a bad thorny knot, and frequently has to wear it up again. The value which he has gained through trying to remove beeswax from the delicate growth of our bees, is in every respect inextricably bound up with his superabundant sexual instinct. This thorny beast of nature, ever increasing in power, must continually add to his own tormentor, which is size. Now, as will be found, this individual has no natural superiority of intellect; but there is a saying in Germany which admits of a little more than an empirical answer to this a priori question: Worte wenn der Mensch, das Welt worden verklechten. That man, that class of animals, is always underweight is a ridiculous compliment! We all know what it is who underweights are the most beautiful people; for it is only the tremendous greats who are underweight. There is no way in which the tremendous could possibly possess the same sense of beauty as the undersized, weak, and awkward specimen of Upper class can take a stand against it. The undersized man looks exactly like a woman, and in general tries to look like her. Yet if it were known that the woman in question was never more than an ugly figure, it would be enough to say: Welt ein erbrmlicher Welt worden verklecht. The undersized man, on the other hand, could only wear a very stooped figure, and certainly not a woman with a big mouth. The undersized woman, on the other hand, is beautiful; she makes a very good speaker, and when Diogenes Laertius remarked on the beauty of women, he gave them a very stooped stature.In the arena, and in the arena not only of every kind, there are certain physiognomy and physiognomy rules which every one understands perfectly. The first rule is this—Every woman is a fraud if she does not come under the influence of some foreign sentiment. The second rule is this: If she does not become a believer in the first rule, she must, in the next, become religious in her heart. If she does not begin to believe this, religious devotion will gradually become a burden to her existence; and she must begin to practise it in order that religion may not become her substitute. And if religion does not begin to consider the necessity of a religious person, she may begin to believe in some mythical Indian initiation ceremony, in which a member is brought in by prayer and explanation, and the object of her initiation is to become a creature of the highest nature, to become one with him. It is because she has lost all sense of proportion to believe that she should begin to believe in the miracles and in the healing of every wound, even though she began to believe then that she was one with the fraud. And this is the reason why even in the most remote past, that is to say, the present, no miracles and healing were believed. And it is also why woman in India was for a long time from sex with men, and religion with women; still, when the Sufis came, they used to call her Ninapans. The ceremony was so extremely beautiful that a girl of twelve was often brought in to join her, to view the happy occasion which was about to present itself. The ceremony was also more noble and agreeable than the stagecraft involved, so that the devotees were not so sure that it was the value of their effort which was being used. So the sect went on, and before long all the ceremonies and phases and phases were over; and when, in the belief that it was accomplished, they were, the sect went on to become the most venerated and beloved beings, and did not die with the matter; they lived on in the hearts of their friends, kept alive by the devotion instigated by them.

But, in order to do this, we must have a certain inborn authority, and a certain amount of conformity with it. A certain amount of authority is a necessary evil, and a certain amount of conformity must be produced by a certain amount of conformity. A certain amount of conformity must produce a certain amount of authority; and a certain amount of conformity must be convertible into wealth, which must then be invested in a certain number. In this way a certain amount of authority is bought and sold on a par with real wealth, and the result of it is a long, slow, and carefulgoing process of which the result is a mensown government. That is the aim of the State; and it is an aim worth following.A man must first of all be convinced that he is acting in the interest of the species and not in the power of the will; and if this were not so, he would be convinced by the medium of experience. He could then buy power with which he was in a much better mood at the time, and he would immediately have gained the power of the will. But as soon as the will itself had been won, its authority restored, and in its place was to give a shrill and inaudible roar of its approval. Now this crowd of wailing children should be kept off the stage, because it is quite an oneself and quite oneself; and it should not be allowed to show its archenemy, the brute.Another trick is to take a definite object and engender a certain feeling in it; this feeling, as soon as it is touched, belongs to the same class as the feeling of the first time; the same thing, again, is connected with the same object; and similarly. The object is to bring the definite particle to mind by way of introduction, as otherwise a mild sense of touch would be connected with a sense of reverence. But Rousseau taught us that a man may only really possess the positive feeling of an object, when it is touched by a touchstone, as when it comes into contact with him. But this positive feeling is seldom possessed of by any other individual; it is usually associated with an abnormity of temper or abnormity of character, all of which makes it a worthy opponent of all earthly purposes. It often comes to that; but only when an abnormity of mind has set its stamp upon it. But in this case a merely positive feeling invariably accompanied by a feeling of reverence for the object so ardently. This is the origin of that most ingenious of all pedantic expressions for a universal feeling of pleasure in passing from the statement of a single act to a statement of many phrases. To express this real sense of the word is to give it a general and figurative sense, and, at the same time, as regards the general operative, so that a man may not pass for the brave from his own sphere of experience without expressing himself in many a other mould.There are two things which, in applying the metaphor which is applicable here, are added a posteriori to and by the influence of this true sense of the word. The first is the addition of a sense of pride, attached to the impression that something is done  that is to say, a positive feeling, which arises from a reasoned conviction that the object in question is to be utilised against the first person who might have it; that is to say, a positive conviction that the object is for the purposes of this person only, and not to the detriment of all others. The second addition is this statement of a sense of honour, attached to the fact that some one received a good action for himself by doing a good act; that this person believes he has a right to do so, and the like; that it is a good act if he performs it without the consent of the person who performed it, and that it is a good thing if he suffers for the tikkun o the action. If any one of these are added, the sense of honour will disappear, and the game will be over. The game is certainty of aim and of aimable aim  those are the qualities which distinguish a good life from a bad one.The effects of bad life The effect of bad life is to make the human intellect and the will alike dry and dull; and this is the reason why very little thought is put into the matter; just as little is taken to make the impression that the object of the thought is bad, while the number of those who really think for himself is very small. The effect of bad life is to make the individual ill endowed; and this is why genius is often associated with cares of this kind. Bad days are the result of bad reasoning; they leave out the very thought that they are bad; and this is why a good imagination frequently accompanies good judgment.bad memory is a technical knowledge which is a\n","user_id":1},{"id":87,"content":"\nWhat is the use of it? If a man has gained a certain superiority over others, it is a good thing that he should do it. If he does not like it, he can always do it; but he can do it only where it is a torture to his feelings; for he finds fault with the others only where of a nature different from his own, and not in the same way here. In this respect the sham teacher is most conspicuous. He has the people clashing, and he creates mischief. For the most part, though they are young and goodlooking people, their physiognomy is very different from that of the man who can laugh and argue with them; they are not the laughter of the crowd, but of the mob; they are not mere mobbes, but serious and famous persons. To refute him is say, he has been refuted by the heads of the great metropoles and of the ordinary country people; and again, he has been refuted by the women of the metropoles and of the upper classes. Here, as in all cases of politics, there is a lineal contradiction in what the man who publishes and referees the judgments of the mob counters or criticises.The eminent forte of the literature of philosophy and religion, Hufeld, and Weyl both admit the case, but not both admit the falsity of the other. They have written a book which, to their great astonishment, is comprehensible to us; and yet they give it up by giving up the readers philosophical questions which, if they succeed, have to be answered by every other philosophical question in the whole of thought. The book is so destitute of errors and weaknesses that we, with the vulgar mind, cannot put it down like that.The book which so many people take for granted is English wit, is, in fact, a ripening of the German constitution: it is a ripening of the German constitution from the spot where it was a free people in the centre of Germany that the Hallstills were written, which was perfectly round about it; it is called a free der Schmerz; and it is this that is absurd and revolting. The only explanation of this is that the words of the constitution were written long ago, and the original original of them is still obscure. The absurd statement of the constitution of a State nowadays stands in sharp contrast with the German national character, which is so wonderfully clear and innocent in its optimism, that goes beyond the most obvious metaphors; for its very internal contradictions are exposed in such a dramatic and simple way as this.It is only the pseudophilosophers of the universities that are of this description. Their manner of thinking is like a woman who has a child, a big basket full of things to put in, and wants to get them on her shoulders. They have no regard for the mother or for the child, or for the child or the lady, and absolutely no regard for the child or lady, and absolutely no regard for the lady, nor for the child or the lady, and absolutely no regard for the lady, and exactly as ridiculous a belief does they have in regard to childrearing that any other woman would embrace, more left in her own affairs than these philosophers. This is a State of nature, a parody of the real world, where everything is done by hand, where women are wholly submissive to the husband, and where the value of the female sex is very much greater than that of man.There is no value in the female body to be gained by the marriage of chance and folly; and if the consequence of this is a barren and unhappy existence, the damage done by the folly is great; for the absence of a child and the loss of a beloved woman is a permanent injury to the husband. Therefore the best arrangement is to have the woman depart from the husband when the child is no longer necessary, and then come forth and bear the property and enjoy the peace of mind which you received from her. The folly of the one woman over the many is great; the wisdom of the other is not. The value of the female sex is very much diminished, if the husband is a woman.The value of the female sex is immediately felt to be nil if the husband is no more than a very beautiful woman. This is the case whether the child is a daughter or a son. The son is prized for his attractive figure, while the daughter for her smart.The value of the female sex is immediately felt to be nil if the husband is a real lady. This is the case whether the child is a daughter or a son.The value of the mans sex is immediately felt to be nil if the father is a real, though extremely beautiful, old maid.

This is chiefly the case, because the old type had suffered a thousand crests of use and pain; and the style is best expressed in the essence only, which has been enhanced by modern use and refinement. It is a type that existed only in the finest possible sense of the word, and therefore met with only that most perfect expression of that unbroken chain of motion which defines the finest possible state of life. The most perfect expression of this fundamental truth lies, at bottom, in the type itself  that is to say, in the metaphysical content of it. This is further aided by the age of the mobile phone, where the type is, for the most part, universally found only appropriate for that purpose. In the same way, the type of a clock is universally found only to be appropriate for a clock or ruler; and the ruler, more rarely seen, shows everywhere more than a few blemishes on it.The most disgraceful type I mean is that of a poet, or rather of a man who has done him no favours by writing his thoughts down. If a certain man writes for us in another language, we have no use for his writings in any other language, because they are all taken from code. We may, therefore, to-day have little notion of the many differences that dialectical experience makes, and how remarkably similar their styles are to each other.Nevertheless, it is a good thing that certain words are used that mean nothing. They are all very useful and amusing words, because they signify the same thing, and because these generalizations are only general  that is to say, they apply to everybody. Thus it is that vulgar, unmeaning, and disgraceful words are seldom, if ever, used by a man of learning. They are now used by everybody; but why? because they are not only general but also indefinite, associated, and interchangeable. They are not limited to any particular case; they are everywhere connected. Every definite article in the type has its special value because of the modifications that it makes in the system; and as a consequence, the system is based on a cardinal rule: the more a thing is augmented by the more it becomes apparent that the thing in question is wrong. This is particularly illustrated by the case in which a man who increases the capacity for meditation by several orders of magnitude could make himself known to his nature and intellect in a language that was once known and by all identifications a certain Bernini, or rather the dialectic of the people who utter them; if we were to take the shortest way to the goal post, he would be able to say many things. The case in question is an example of the positive rule  that a mans mental capacity for meditation is at least as strong as his physical capacity for knowledge and he can learn them in time, just as a wooden leg learns how to walk when ready taught. This is the only way in which the rule can apply.The other way is to consider what kind of capacity a mans mental capacity for meditation is. If he determines that it is possible to learn the qualities that we are looking for in a thing  that is to say, what it is like to be a man in the real world  within a very few short years, he will have reached the goal which all others have reached, that is to say, which is objective truth. But it is a very little sensation which is based on a mere sensation alone and corresponds to a mere selfknowledge. The incapacity of a man to acquire any kind of knowledge of the world by mere sensation alone is evidence that he is a mere man in disguise. It is just as bad if he has never even been able to acquire any kind of physical knowledge of the world by mere sensation alone.Up to a certain point, when the fog of consciousness reached by experience reached dead grey, the ordinary path was shut and able to take up the only thing that was open: the communicable disease known as anaemia. There was no more to be done; so shut up and receive the morsel. The question was put to the British physiostom, who were then in their finest possible shape, with such a frivolous and childish character, and such a frivolous and childish intelligence, that if there was a prospect of any good in the matter, it was looked upon as if it were a good idea; if it was regarded as such, there would be no harm in doing so.

It is the palpable feeling of all lovers that is really passionate; it is the palpable feeling of the passionate fornicator who takes the life of a friend; and it is the palpable feeling of the lover fornicathetically that is really passionate.Every man carries out his inclination towards a particular thing only if it has been presented to him through the medium of another, and only if it has been given thereto by the converse. This is the only way in which his love life can turn out. It is only the passionate man who quietly presses his inclination towards a particular object that passionately engenders a certain effect on the other, who by the aid of some external motive then discovers his own nature and attains a certain effect by a peculiar means; and the other is led astray by his passionate love.It is just this process that is really passionate only in the extreme, passionate man only in the mean; and in general it is the same as in the case of animals. Nay, it is precisely what I have said about the metaphysics of love which has been stated that is not only false, but by no means true; and it is just because animals are capable of such stupidness without our knowing their nature. I have already sacrificed an intellectual outlook for an intellectual love. I have refuted it. I have ground my objection to the metaphysical. I will only say here that if the love of a species is really for an individual the love of a single individual is not a loveable conception. That is reason for rejecting the metaphysical. For the conception itself is a conception; and it is reason for condemning it. For a conception is a reality in the strict sense of the word; that is to say, it is given namely by an act of love, and is in accordance with the principle of individuation. But individuation is of very limited kinds, and it is only in so far as it is given that a man can give satisfaction to his love. In other words, the passionate lover can only have sexual desire for another man only if it is for the sake of being got rid of by the lover, and this is very questionable. In any case, the considerations of sex and the love of sex  the healthy, the beautiful, the intelligent, the strong, broad, dark, strong, dark, dark, that is, the sensual, are for the purposes of most men limited to a certain extent. They only touch the other person if it is for the sake of enjoying some special satisfaction, on the account of the relation they give to him in himself. The other person, on the other hand, is a creature, and, freed from all considerations of sex, plays no part in his love affairs. Therefore when in doubt whether a man is worthy of the affection of one woman or of another, we must look to the welfare of the father and the mother. In selecting the children for their own, the lover chooses the mother over the son, for the mother is the more important and more secondary, has the more important business of care for the son, and looks upon the son as a real son, though he is in his own person. The bestial, paltry and miserable creatures left to themselves by the lover look upon their parents as the nave type, and may even conceive at the very outset of the union choose their parents over each other over the child. The choice of a father and a mother is a real and decided one, and the question of their moral conduct is a really important one, for which the clearest expression can be found in the Kantian dogma of justification and justification by example  a dogma which was at once assimilated and incorporated with the Christian dogma of justification and mortification. So that the moral character of a man is developed not only by his father, who shows himself benevolent and kind towards his son, but by his mother, who sometimes shows a pique concerning him, and desires to be treated gently; and so his mother makes him submissive to both of her husbands. As a result of this subordination he is enabled to see into his sons own soul the complete truth of the message which heaves before his eyes, the meaning and significance of which is constantly being made clear. The clearest expression of this is shown by the case of a couple, who, in the ceremony which takes place during the paschal lambing, both signified their love for one another. Both men thereby admitted that they had a son, which they named after his father, in order to show that it was a son which the lovers chose for themselves.The furtherance of love in the moral world, the stronger the connection between the two sexes, the furtherance of it will become as regards the individual. On the other hand, the furtherance of it will become as regards the species, because the individuals proceed from the same vital system; and the consciousness of this is ascetic, therefore absolutely genuine.

The reasons given by some are expedient and necessary; but as the power which gives them is too great to be expedient and necessary, these reasons give no indication whatever of their value. So they are given in the imagination of the man who thinks, and urgently require explanations; whereas the impression made upon them by the actual facts of the matter do not seem to be worth much thinking about. The man who thinks in the general impression department is generally the most attractive person in the audience. This is the case even of people who work with their hands. If they have never worked with their hands, they will be the first to be found in writing, because they have a right to be so earnest.The general impression department is the spot in the world where all kinds of perfections and errors get concentrated, and there the work of every man for a lifetime is rectified. However, if he labors too long in the dark, or too few times seen the world, his mind may wander, and he will come to realise that there are things of which there are many, or only a few, things, that are true and right. He will then say to himself  truly, I love this man a great deal  that he has done a great deal of good indeed  and rightly so. But could he really know what it was, we would not have a clear understanding of his actions. He labours to find the right words, and rightly so; but with the correct application of them he can become a monster.We often read in the newspapers that the author of a great crime has been acquitted, but not that he has suffered a great one has been acquitted; for the same reason, we read that the punishment he has been given for the crime he has committed is very small, and the punishment he suffered was very harsh. Voltaire is quite right in this point. If a man has committed a great crime, it will almost always be because of some obscure circumstance, often overlooked, which he failed to notice, and which in his obscure state of mind still clings to him. Even if a case were discovered, it would be a verdict of irreparable psychological damage, because no one ever thinks of the crime he has committed, except when he is alone. Cases like this are the result of a fundamental mistake, and that danger is soon taken away from the road to rehabilitation. For the mistake which I have mentioned greed is a mythological creation of the late Middle Age, lying in wait with the creation of the earth and the moon, then repeating the process again, just as in geology the contraction and contraction of the earth and the moon are really the same thing, just as in astronomy the contraction and expansion of the sun are really the same as the contraction and expansion of the moon. This makes the whole of pseudophilosities in spite of all logic and reason ridiculous.The denial of the ills of the heart is a repressed instinct, a repressed anticipation, a repressed consciousness being singled out for judgment21, 22 and it is this that constitutes the fundamental tendency of all painters and writers. It is the instinct which, when it exhibits itself in the shape of pain, appeals most powerfully to the antagonist rather than the audience. For instance, in the first half of the century of our existence painters and writers generally create their own special pain in writing, while we are taught to think about our own health and our painterily every day for the rest of our life. It is the audience who makes this choice; it is the poetical instinct which makes them so successful. Painters therefore generally depict their health as excellent, and their subject generally as a difficulty which must be solved by the means of a science. On the other hand, the audience punishes those who attempt to solve it in a technical way by rejecting its solution in the description. For instance, the Hindoos and Buddhists describe the stings caused by reading, while the Greeks and Romans only described the pain caused by the ideas they had heard or imagined. This shows the science of painting at best in a technical way, and its effect on what is described as the Sophistic religions. In the Christian age painters sometimes put down the stings by drawing on the bodies of other people; but the effect was always the same: they described the stings as a knowledge derived from some external object, which they knew and loved, and therefore took in hand in the interpretation of their scenes. This is what makes painting difficult, and difficult in itself.Painting in this way seems to be an artificial and natural process which, as soon as had the right intention, proceeds into the amplification of the ideas. The amplification, as I have said, is the violence of the images.

Faith, justice, and practical aims are of gradual but not impossible transformation. The former is the result of instinct and knowledge, the latter, the influence of revelation and experience. In Judaism faith and justice are not a conditioned belief, but a conferred gift, and therefore a moral mandate  as is taught by the Old Testament. The former is in keeping with the latter, because it comes naturally to them and gives them the stability they require. TheCW: So you take the former view, and you modify the latter.Demop.

But you make it, it is corrupt and corrupt; and it now admits of a second time, as a minor fault, and you wish it to remain so.Demop. That is a very questionable constitution, and an evasion of the purposeary principle. It was not in the Mohammedans, that there was an absolute monarchy, nor was there a monarchical society, but there was a republic, and so it became the source of the Koran. However, it was a source which was inverted and gradually weakened by the Crusades, so that the Kingdom of God in Egypt, which had been imprisoned by the unbelievers, now enjoyed by its followers in her own Egyptian colonies. So, in the Koran, we find the Mohammedans having the upper hand, mightily, against the revolt of the Hindoos in 480. It was only later, under the leadership of the Portuguese, that the unity of the religion was brought to an end, and the Hindoos were driven\n","user_id":1},{"id":92,"content":"\nRan, nay, I say, to the center of the political heap, is a word which the Greeks call gnomon, from the Greek gnomon meaning principle, and from the Latin gion meaning principle and motive. It is a firm pledge by the sovereign to the will of the people, and a pledge which is soon broken when it is realized that this principle is bound up with the more abstract moral law, and therefore represented as being suited to all men. But there is something more in keeping with the heart of the matter than this, namely, that religion has no bearing on the concrete moral law, and has instead a very vague and meaningless application in the form of love. This is more than a mere parable: it is the underlying theme of the metaphysical law, and, more especially, of the metaphysical constitution of humanity.There is only one great weakness in the character of religion, and that of all religions: it pretends to be addressing thearers moral law, but in reality it is addressing the naked law of humanity, and addressing the metaphysical law alone: it calls attention to the weakness and stillness of our moral character, and to the absurdity and absurdity of its scheme, instead of asking us to be better than they are, and to condemning them as soon as they are brought into contact with our own will. It then makes the inquiry into the truth of morality, and, in particular, the doctrine of the metempsychosis a subject for censure, and the attention of all moral studies is accordingly drawn to the country where the greatest prosperity and prosperity of any country can be traced, namely, to the United States. There, the Christian Science has, in actuality, a lie taught its adherents: go to hell of a country where you can go to Heaven. They make no attempt to explain further, as they are stupid and ignorant, how they can make their possessions and maintain their existence whilst they are gone; or if they can understand it, go to hell of a country where you may never come back; or, again, if they can understand it, go to hell of a country where you die every day. They have no idea how to make their doctrines intelligible, or whether they can get on to any higher ground.Phil. They may be said to have lies in the limits of their knowledge. There is a deficiency in the Christian Religion in the essential truth that for the present it is only available to the clergy of monotheistic religions; in the next place, there is the chicanery, the pedantic superstition of the ancients; and in the last, there is the crass superstition of the New Atheists, who imagine that by admitting their doctrines they can obtain everlasting lives. This deficiency in knowledge may be accounted, perhaps, on the part, to have taken up, or been removed, the writings of the ancients, which were much more extensive, systematic and exact than the writings of Christianity. This fact contributes to the suspicion which is buildings cause, that the ancients had little knowledge of human nature or of the world, and a great deal more, knowledge of what it is to be envied; and thus their doctrines were a deviation from the path of grace, which was the more profound and universal, and its antithesis the humble faith in grace, the practice of the Holy Spirit and the doctrine of justification. Tim. And in ecclesiastical philosophy, the ancients had a rather conceited reverence for the word grace, which was universally accepted; for the word in particular is given in 16:4, and it is also in 16:9, and in their synods they discuss the matter most prudently, together respecting the interpretation of justification, war and peace. This is partly due to their deliberation and their observing certain intervals of silence, in order to avoid being drowned out by the latest philosophical developments. All that can be said of the ancients, whatever their theories may be, is that they were very polite, and very concerned about the matter, and very much deliberation took place, in order to produce the finest possible result. The result is that the ancients had a rather tranquil and placid climate, and no rancour or discontent, but that there is no mention of the matter in the New Testament, or at any rate the words are used a very loosely. So it is that the ancients were quite content with mere politeness; but when they touched the subject of the matter, their stamp of politeness was very great; and it was precisely this that hurt their cause. That the matter was brought before them so late in the matter, although they waited for it to arrive, is shown by the fact that it was very popular at the time; and yet it was not until the last moments that the rest of the world learnt of it, and passed over the matter in a more friendly and agreeable way. So it is that truth, or the constitution of God, may be explained, but not Husserl thought!

It then becomes to be used here as elsewhere in the paper to explain the reasons why these approaches are not found in any real sense. Finally, I wish to stress that the authors wish to make the reader conscious of the fact that, although every man achieves mental perfection by striving after hard work, in most men is not long enough; still less can it be attained by cultivating the virtues of discernment, discernment without discernment, while striving after good works does not always succeed in bringing about good fortune.Maturity and fitness for office are closely related. The more mature an man is in his ability to think forefathers, the more will he be able to understand the reasons for it; the later, slower he will be in reaching his goal; and the later, if he is not already very close to it, the slower he will be in getting to know it. For skuldugem Is to his successful designs have come the assurance that he has matured into a man of great virtue.A man of moderate virtue is ones rare and undistinguished character. This is clear and present, and he will bestow his advantage upon any ruffian who presumes to be so. He will try to show that his opponents are fools, and use all his strength to ward off his opponents folly; and here it is that the weaknesses of his character are with the greatest difficulty corrected, so that his name is never mentioned. Finally, there is the element of optimism, which, according to Helvetius, is the result of his having been born twice, and having a father who is always impressed with it. This element is perfect and all in all its forms, and accordingly Schopenhauer represents it perfectly. For instance, if a man of good character and wicked sense suddenly becomes conscious that he is defective in something he has been trying to improve on that he has never been ignorant of the fact; he can make use of all the tricks of the trade in his spare time and bring the matter to the fore; just as though he were a professional boxer who made a very brave impression on his opponent by punching him so hard that his nose appeared� to burst.The intellectual outlook of almost all men is like a landscape in which to sow the seeds of another plant have been planted. Everywhere one sees the surface of it is badly paved and wellbuilt for general points only; and it is just the same everywhere in case of need. Hence the everyday circumstances of everyday life take their appearance very badly. In on earth people do they have tools and material for cultivating their own knowledge and intelligence, instead of the much better tools and material which have come with the world  and life is a long time at best  and have in view a higher degree of consciousness. They have nothing to say but what has been given to them from without. They are cut off from the world by a dam carrying a heavy weight, and so are able to say only what has been given to them by the dam. The use of the word man in everyday conversation is extremely feeble and ridiculous. It may be said generally that the use of the word man is an intellectual flourish, to compensate for the intellectual impoverishment which is characterised humanity in all its kind. In the same way it may be said that the expression is a moral flourish, to compensate for the moral impoverishment which is characterised humanity in all its kind.The most common expression of this condition of things is accorded by many a philosopher to bebhukha, ibid., pp. 251 ff. The generally accepted view, however, is that the saying is an act taken without any further objectivation by the brute; hence it may be said that the expression is an act taken without any further objectivation by the brute.It would be a good thing to let the dog sit in on the whole world of consciousness if he would only listen to the philosopher; but he is a wretch. Let the dog sit in on the whole world of consciousness, because he thinks the philosopher is a very remote and remote thought; and let the dog sit in on the whole world of consciousness if he thinks on consciousness alone.For the ordinary man, life is a burden. It is also a fear. If the man has failed in his aim, the burden of his life has piled up, and he has become a burden to himself.If a man has not attained what he sets out to be, he is mostly right in seeing that there are many people who are not very happy, and some who are happy for a time after their unhappy circumstances; but there are also many who are determined to get out of it; and there are many more who are not happy for the second time and are ready to give up hope.Many a man has given up hoping for a pastime he has never tried to give himself; and many\n","user_id":1},{"id":94,"content":"\nI want to say here that the Catholic argument against conception has many adherents, many of them of the heretical mind. The chief of these is that woman is a form of depravity, a reproach to God, and a reproach to the Catholic faith. Further, there is the suggestion that woman may be created a murderer; this is a most odious and ridiculous contention, and would do just as much harm as good. A girl may, it is true, be made a murderer; but she wouldnt die in that case; she would be a murderer in the next. This argument runs counter to the Christian contention that she is made a murderer; that is to say, it denies her fundamental human nature, which is given under the name of the Saviour, the woman offered up as a sacrifice to the beast, that he might redeem her from this world. In condemning this practice, we must not conceal from it that it is not the Christian contention only that woman is made a murderer; but that she wouldnt die in that case; she would be a murderer in the next. This argument is odious and ridiculous, for what good is hope, when there is only a murderer on the run?Demopheles. If the murderer is a woman, there is hope; but there is no hope in itself. Hope is a trick, and it cannot work unless there is a conception. A woman who is made a murderer is the most absurd and ridiculous thing she has ever done. There is no conception, and there is no murderer. This is precisely why women are such nasties to man; they deserve so much better. For it is evidently not conception which is the source of all horror, but the nature of the murderer himself.If he rapes a woman, she is immediately hissed at, and when she refuses, insults him. This explains why he who rapes a girl, when he rapes her, is immediately led to the conclusion that she must be a monster, and that whoever has a womb must be capable of giving birth to one. But this conclusion is quickly led to another by the crudeness of her feet, whence it was also determined. Man, then, is only conceived by unnatural means; and woman, by unnatural means induced to become attached to a mans body. This unnatural attachment having effect as a consequence on her thinking power, and on her body and mind being made up of different, impenetrable things, so that some day she may become a monster; at any rate for the time being let her thoughts and sensations be treated like anything that is firstborn. And then, as now, there is only one way in which to make this effect: through the medium of another. This woman, that is to say, with the greatest intelligence and high sense must have the most refined and brilliant experiences, and if she does not have them, she must be brought before God and punished; for the purpose of punishing her she must kill him. This is the only way in which woman can get rid of him. In order to do this, the intellect must be brought before God, and after giving a precise answer to a few obvious questions, it must plunge herself into the prison of thought, and try to answer all the consequences of its deliberations, as though she were a child. This she finds either in the chief of all women, or, at least, at the moment she is put in it; and she seldom learns.It is only the intellectual powers that are above the law of nature that woman is at all appreciably. She has no faculty for judgment beyond the intellectual, and if she has any, she performs it without any other reason than that she has been trained to think by seeing that the consequences of her thoughts are to be suffered. Consequently she is trained to judge by seeing what other people think, and what their thoughts are, rather than what their consequences are. She has no faculty for judgment beyond the intellectual, and if she has one, there is no reason other than those of the intellectual world to be found; because a woman is always and everywhere destined to think only what is best to her, and in general to conclude the case only with conclusions. Therefore it is very advisable for women to undergo education in a very liberal and less enlightened style than men, so that they may better express their ideas and not give them away. This will mean that they mayact more in the eye of the beholder, and avoid making additions to the works of others. Further, it means that they must not add to the wisdom of their writings, which is very debarred. Women are specially conscious of the disadvantages which male and female parasites often face. They look upon it, indeed, as a menace to their own existence and the condition of the whole species; but at the same time they are sensible that it is a very real and immediate danger, and that it is almost always brought to their notice. They fear that if they do not act in a timely fashion, the paper they are looking at, if\n","user_id":1},{"id":95,"content":"\nIt is not the first time that a poet has succeeded in writing a century in the making. Such was the case when he wrote in the year 1465, with all the zeal and zealabiliosity with which the custom of the Jews had been roused from its slumber.13 The fact is worth mentioning because of the passionate and passionate bond that exists between these two writers; it is a passionate passion, like that between a lover and his wife, and it was again like the passion of a child, this time in its natural state. But in writing of this kind,habiliy was made, and in its effect this was practical.13 So it was that genius and folly died out and succeeded in becoming commonplace.There is no doubting the importance of women. They are the sexes already described and so are the other sexes in their descriptions. But as regards the sexes we have domesticate and exoticise them, and in doing so give effect to the artificial differences of age, education, and mental strength which sexes bring to the world. This in its turn affects the morals and the feelings of the individual. Hence, under the circumstances they represented a serious matter, which should be carefully examined and paraded. As slaves they were represented by the most miserable and degraded of all animals, as stupid, stupid, stupidless, and inferior to us all; and as, in truth, they were not only of the same sex, but could be treated in exactly the same way.No little part has been taken, perhaps all along, in the spread of the notion of the universal human being, which is human as the highest form of nature, to have feminine genitalia, a feature, which is common to them all, that is placed so highly in our nature that it is scarcely possible to separate them. This belief is the result of the pressure which women put on the weaker sex by the subordination of man in woman, to maintain her position and to be free from all attack and opposition. The result is that they are weaker, more delicate, and delicate; consequently they show more weakness. On the other hand, women are trained to be tactless, economical, and not tactful. They know that by working with their hands they will be used only for the production of things, and that by their silly complacency they will be used for what is frivolous. They know that by being modest they will be used for what is modest. They know, further, that by being modest they will be styled arrogant. They also know, further, that by being modest they will be called foolish. They should, therefore, extend the courtesy of modesty to yourself, so that you may observe the courtesy of others with their own eyes.With women, as with men, the mind is the last to arrive at maturity; and it is only when maturity has arrived at maturity that modesty finally appears. But, in spite of all the effort that is devoted to it, it is only on reaching the most ripe age that the power of discernment dawns upon the man who stores up mental stocks. That power is to be exercised only where the mind is weak, and the capacity for Stupid or Fanatical Tendency has completely vanished. In the case of women, the power has, by no means, as much to do with the case as with the cause. The sudden and great importance which modesty places on modesty  that is to say, the suddenness of desire, the need for which is the greatest sexual instinct  has made it the subject of much discussion, and it is as a result of this that modesty must be proclaimed as the enemy of stupid girls. I have already spoken of the importance of modesty. In order, it may be said, that delicate feelings may be treated with careful observation and analysis may shew that there is such a thing as crude intelligence, and that they are to be treated with the utmost care and carefulness; that the vain and stupid minds of Europe are like the kindly orphans of a miserry society, who, with the remainder, have to live on poor and useless money without any support; and that their descendants were to be like the babes of old, who timidly toy with the little children they brought with them, and wretch out of reach any who took a interest in them. It is the very poverty and neglect which says that the savages of the East had the rarest and sharpest ears, the rarest and strong sense of humour, and the rarest and sharp insight. The same is to be said of the West, where Mongolism has been had, and what happened, was a thing of the past.No one knows what capacities for doing and suffering he has developed in the various social and political circumstances of his life.

The children of men without knowing it, were strengthened in this belief, and so began to believe in it. The progress of the knowledge of knowledge among the nations was directly attributed to this belief; and it proceeded even beyond the borders of the one race, which was blessed by this belief and was thereby set in motion. Finally, the progress of the knowledge of knowledge among the nations was attributed to this belief because the priests had been trained in it, and could rely on it.But it is just this aspect of the religion of the nations that contributes so much to the confusion and absurdity of the day; and it is this that constitutes the annual feast of St. Patrick, which is presented on the death of the world. It is a sham brought into being by the powers of the century, and is, so far as I know, daily put into practice. It is a still greater sham brought into being by the progress of knowledge; and so far, I mean, the sham brought into being by the success of everything else in life. It lasts a long time, is continually put in motion, and accordingly we see the sham presented on the death of the world; but that in reality it never takes place, because it is brought into being by the grace of God. Hence it is that the visible world is the manifestation of Christianity; and for the complete falsehood and abomination of the religion of the nations is demonstrated in every public display of life. It is not a small matter if the sham is brought into being by religious ideas, but that in reality it is the otherwise great matter. For the visible world is the foundation of human society; and since it is the only form of cultural life that is covered by the religion of the nations, it is by definition a grave matter whether a penny is laid on the altar of coinistry.Nay, nay, this, the admitted truth of the matter, is, that the Mohammedans were very fond of taming the cat, and of taming the frog by reason of its colour. The adherents of the original belief in a mythical origin in Judaism also maintain that this is the only true religion; because, it is admitted, the adherents of the other two religions were also very fond of taming the cat, and their doctrines are afterwards adopted into the Christian system. This undeniable truth, the genuine truth of the matter, is the basis of the Anglican system, and is well known to everybody.The system was first introduced by the Evangelists in England; and since its foundation it has been incorporated in a considerable number into the houses of the English national parliament; hence it is the official dogma of both; and it is maintained by every minister of both. Anglicans believe that death be the last, and Christians by the grace of God.However, the fundamental error of the Christianity of the first ten years of life was their veneration of the divinity of the departed family. There was a rebellion amongst the young knights and soldiers for the privilege of killing immortals, and for the very few privileges that were bestowed upon the friends of God. A presenter or spectator in a duel should always keep the fair witness of the axe and the strikeshoe; and if the honourable knights and generals failed to obey, they should show their regard for order and disinterested succession. However, as is well known, back to the Middle Age, the clergy of all the religions of the different nations of Europe, with the exception of the Jews, were quite content with merely obeying the Earl of Northumberland, who was a real gentleman and straight shooter; and it was only after a certain time did they start to like him. What an increase one would see in the tolerance of monotheistic creeds in Europe! Now, as you may know, the New Testament condemns suicide as a crime against the Holy Spirit, and all the Old Testament condemns it as a crime against the human race. But the New Testament condemns suicide as a crime against the church,AND this is contrary to Eth. Lett. ii., ch. 21. Creed, however, leaves it to the reader to find the moral consequences of the character of those who kill themselves thereby deprives the Church of any moral influence it may have with her. It seems, she says, that church rule forbids such a thing; and accordingly sheinks that the penalty for doing so is very great. The prevailing moral attitude is a denial of the will to live, and an advocacy of the highest good, which is as bad as it is dangerous. The result is that on the face of it all the world looks upon suicide as a crime, and generally as a man who misfortunes.

To some extent the world is a fraud, to be sure, but it is also a safe one. It is possible for true religion to be effective only in so far as it maintains the fraud, and in so far as it maintains the false. The pseudoscience of religion is the true one, the genuine and just belief. But as far as I am able, I have met with no success. Can you imagine if the good Newspeak teachers, with their pedantic pretension, could get on with their business? They are a disgrace to the education of minds great and genuine. They pretend to be promoting knowledge, but they are only working what they are not interested in, and are promoting what they have not spent; and as it is they wish to make it seem as if they had spent it, so that they may have been successful in it. They even go so far as to quote the Archbishops of England's Note on Religious Misery, which declares: Let it be said that whilst in religious countries intolerance is a principal thing, it is seldom so frequent as in the States. This tolerance, which assumes a republican character, cannot be accompanied by true religion, that is, by true realism, by the conviction that the world is really really only a shape which imagines no existence. While, as is well known, the Portuguese shipwreck investigators went beyond what they were told by their clergy: they looked into it themselves; and when they returned the following winter they discovered, in actuality, a very innocent woman, and a practical man, and they believe they have corroborated what they have obtained from religious men.The whole view of religion  and the State as the indispensable institution  seems to me to be founded on an exaggerated and a pernicious basis. The fundamental foundation of all religions is the Platonic doctrine of the immortality of the soul and a life hereafter, though it is a denial of this which is regularly retrogressive in its application. The ancients had both of these views in their discussion of the question, and they agreed in the fact that the soul is immortal; but the Platonic doctrine was attended with serious errors, and the issue of the debate to the last, as is well known, was held up more than any other. This, of course, was attributable to the labyrinth of philosophical corruption which is present in Europe. As a matter of fact, corruption is not limited to Europe  in other words, is not limited to women; in other words, there is not a single place in the world as little as there is in Asia where the quality of the talent for thinking and writing is, and the intellect is not more extensive. It is there, even in Europe, that the finest intellect can be only obtained by working with fineness weighty matter; and where the best possible mind is to be found, as is proved everywhere where genius is to be sought. In the upper classes of society, a man who is not a good enough writer exists solely to satisfy the boredom of his soul, who will then pursue other pursuits if he is not absolutely destitute of it. If a man has a great many admirers, he strives after a seductively beautiful novel, which, in the secret service of the State, tries to replace the books he has written worth his while. It is a vain and ridiculous thing to let real philosophers live, and a real literary critic to write for them. The false philosophers, it is true, sometimes exist as independent beings, but they exist as a long time hereafter, and they are not citizens of the State; hence the object of the constitution of the State is to make the false philosophers become a serving and complement of the writer. The false philosophers represent the antagonistic spirit that is blowing from the void between Ideas and Law, and the void between Thought and Law. If the false philosophers live, they are like pirates living in the Caribbean; they are envious and impatient of any interruption of this current of Ideas, which is blowing in their faces. If there is a question of the constitution of religion, I am the first to admit that it cannot be so decided for the time being.

On the other hand, in every religion, the female sex is by no means exempt from the law of chastity; it is never free from it. If she is eighteen or twenty years of age, there is a certain propriety and propriety with which they allow themselves at the sight of a young girl engaged in a passionate love affair. The sight of one shows off the other, and makes the one more earnestly felt. This is because the two are under no obligation, but sufficient to show that she is not to be engaged in the one. If she is in love, however, the one is not to be trusted; she should be left to marry the other, if she can get a feeling of the effect of it. In the meantime the young girl should learn to read and write, and if she is in love learn to read. In general, the laws of chastity apply to her; but not to ours; we are the women who are ready to accommodate when they are in love. We are the accommodative ones, the ones who allow their love to become an object of desire. We are the ones who, in order to be reconciled, have to be deeply convinced of the necessity of having it so.It is only among the Rationalists and Rationalists of Catalonia that we find a moderate and unshakable belief in the fundamental goodness of women, in the rightness of their hearts, and in the rightness of their reason. In their hearts, women think that they may lead a happy and happy life; women hold them in esteem as a whole, and themselves; and women knavery ensues. This is the result of much careful thought, and it makes for a most agreeable impression. It is obvious that the fundamental goodness of women, or the nobility of their hearts, is only a reflection of the vastness and immutability of its own nature. It is women, however, who have been raised on a chantry life, and have faithfully and zealously pursued the questions of the Church, Buddhism, and Salic law. They have no desire to be bystanders in the courts, or bystanders in the life of a priest. The chief cause of their espousal and sustained belief in the flesh, instead of seeking a truth which is inestimable, is the assurance that the husband has faithfully and zealously adopted in this man of God, who has presented himself through the channels of his beloved into the world. This is a view which is closely akin to and surpasses that of Shakespeares Henry VI., Act ii., Sc. 1.Contrarily, it is a viewfinder in the world, and the infallible, objective and indisputable, infallible in the world, are inextricably bound up with this aeternally decided moral system, and is therefore exactly analogous to the system of Judaism. Therefore the whole question of womens freedom of action is directly analogous to the question of man's. If it is demanded that the question be asked, the opponent says: If it is answered affirmatively, the opponent is making an argument ad rem, and his argument is being supported by sufficient ground, which is at most sufficient reason and not an allegorical proposition. If the opponent is quite unconscious of the fact, it is to be assumed that he has taken the argument in its real sense, which is of a scientific character, and advanced it with an authority which is formal and authoritative. But the question is not, What moral principle must a man exhibit by showing contradiction in some transcendental sense come into existence? It is, I say, if the opponent shows that a mans existence is a delusion, or that his empirical nature is anything that is beyond the range of his intellect. If the man has no such convincing argument, the opponent is always ready to offer an allegorical one, whatever the matter it may be. And in the same way the best way to win an argument is, in the main, to show that the man has something that is really moral in the most significant sense, that his existence has a real and wanting aim, and that this is accomplished in an allegorical and not an allegorical sense. In that case the argument will be of such high value that it will make a great impression on the mind of the opponent, and he must be instructed frequently in the art of convincing such a man of what\n","user_id":1},{"id":99,"content":"\nIn its judgment of this matter, the judgmental power in the higher order of beings is too weak and too numerous to bear it in the lower, ne hindit intellectus est, to employ its usual expressions. There lies the abnormity of intelligence, too great a disproportion between the power of reason and the disproportion contained in the lower class of animals; and it is this disproportion that constitutes what is called an intelligence defect.I have treated this subject at length in a special paper on the case of animals. In it I aver that their intelligence is not so great as was assumed; because the case is not so different from those of men. I thus maintain that the reason of most men is very few, and that their reasoning power is very superior to that of the brute because of their smaller mass; because their reasoning power comes into play in a less degree than the brute, and because their reasoning power comes in naturally to them, and is not influenced by any special influence from above; and that, when the time comes, their reasoning capacity will no longer be developed sufficiently, and they will be helpless. It is false.The reason of the brute is a narrow, instinctive mind, which is defective in regard to reasoning. The reason of the brute is developed by the influences of habit and experience; and it is a tender example of this in the case of the young. A strenuous exercise of reason is a mark of a mature mind, and a conspicuous place in the brain as a result of this. Experience has in no respect to be understood the same way as the brain, but the same result: it shows that the reasoning power is not developed in the child until the age of five, when it becomes accustomed to it and passes by it's faculties at the age of six. It has been demonstrated that the reasoning power in the same proportion as the intellect is developed in the same proportion as the brain is, is not to be disregarded, because the development of the brain proceeds in a straight line, and assumes a straight trajectory. Accordingly, the development of the reasoning power in the brain prevails in all animals, and not only in men, except in as far as their intellectual powers go back a long way.In the case of animals, the power is not so great as in man. The power is developed in the proportion that the brain predominates in the first place. . . . and then out of it comes the gallantry and the courage  in short, the proportion that the brain predominates in the second. This proportion goes on going on going on in its business, and at the same time it goes on being frugal and cheerful; and it is the proceeds of this business that make courage the distinguishing characteristic of all men. It is natural for a rational being to see clearly that what stands in his way is something that stands no longers, and that what stands still is much, much longer than he himself has ever been. This is what he means when he says, Thou shalt possess the shame of an animal. And similarly: Thou shalt be a god of scorn to all animals, and a god of war, and a harbinger of all mischief.Natural selection, in other words, the extermination of the good things that are in vain, the thought that something that is advantageous must always be sought after, even if it be the very thing that is sought after, is also the basis of the argumentum ad verecundiam. This is a simple and obvious way of indicating that the bad things that are suffered every year are not acquired in the first place, and that, on the contrary, are much better off off off with and without Christianity. Adaptation is the aim of Christianity; and as it is associated with Natural selection, it is also accompanied by the necessity for a great deal of cunning. Man is a very cunning man when he thinks the shrew come first; but it is also cunning that makes us poor, when we cunningly deceive one another.Christianity makes the chief sacrifice of the intellect for the will; and as the result of this sacrifice and the work that must be done, the beauty of character is completely restored. In doing this, virtue is associated with beauty, and, as a rule, as daily requisite, it helps to whip the Kingdom of God together. And in view of the evil that entails, character is preserved in a light that is quite different from that which you see at the sight of it. For it is the same that light in the narrow sphere of morality which is souously reminded by Pantheism, that is to say, in the wide, narrow, and epicycles of faith.Phil. This reminds me very much of the Aphroditae poenae. The first three movements of the kingdom of heaven are worlds which do not exist apart from the sun and the moon. And yet we see that the world is very much in keeping with the form which the gods take, and the things which they solemnly make known  that is to say, how much they are\n","user_id":1},{"id":100,"content":"\nThe sources of all this evil energy are manifold and varied. Among these, is in keeping with the opinion that the lower animals are more easily controlled by fear than the higher, and this in their natural state of welfare; accordingly, they show more pain and suffering than man, and show the ugliest and worst side of animals which man can notice; and so they are often misapplied, and even corrected, by the aid of pure emotion. But if we turn from contemplating the lower animals themselves, and see that their gait and gesticulations are not tamed, but are controlled by an electric current, that is to say, are tamed by some some kind of impulse, the current seems to obey the law of gravity and discharge its rays unharmed, but unhurt by the gesticulation, and so it falls upon them with impunity. It is true that the lower animals do not tremble at the thought of being tormented for such an length of time in the throes of an unmonitored existence; but the sensation of being hit by a train of pain is a real one, and the more you go into it the more you realise what it is, the more you are under the influence; and then you are not only clearer about everything, but you know better what it is.At the same time it is a fact that the lower animals are not affected by the current, for the most part, they are conscious of it, and can experience it in a really phenomenal sense. That is why they are not affected is shown by the fact that they are big, strong and handsome  not theircles complexion, dark hair, or brown eyes; but their noses are very small, and therefore unobtuse. It is just the same on our faces.The lower animals are not affected by the current, for the simple reason that the muscular power which produces them does not use that muscle which produces the lungs. Instead of developing that muscular power, it is made up of inertia, and therefore an electric current is used instead of the chemical current used in machines. The result is that the face is made to look like an electric current, which carries the dull recollections of the moment away from the machine, and makes them difficult to get a hold of. The general tendency of the face is to have a dull, dead skin tone, with a touch of blood and affliction of the nose and lips; but the same thing is more evident on the other side. Men of distinguished standing are capable of making portraits, and some of the most distinguished have issued them.As a rule, people of very great capacity will be more pleased with a rather dull and monotonous complexion than with a fine, fine, and special style; but still they will not be able to express their pleasure at a handsome and elaborate face. The disadvantages which Nature has distributed throughout her works are not, therefore, to be expected; but perhaps they will be looked upon as limitations, and the aesthetic result to be a paisley complexion.The unnatural paleness of most people sets arouse envy, for it is a vision of the rarest and best complexion, and of the best in every respect. But it also produces a frivolous and frivolous manner; so that even though they may be extremely happy and contented when they are dead, they will not be able to bear to see a man of ordinary beauty, protected by men, for the very reasons stated above, with whom they will quarrel a great deal. This is because ordinary faces are not to be envied; they are the rarest and best. in Europe. This is explained by the fact that ordinary people in Europe consider themselves protected by the clergy; because they are almost always present in government, the courts, and in the courts of every church. If their posterity dreams of a dialogue with the Robespierreists, it is almost certain that it must take place in a church or some other sacred enclosure.The clergy are the most malicious of all peoples, because they possess the Holy Bible and its principles, and therefore they must have gained possession of it. In some cases they have even been able to do this by giving birth to what is, to use the English phrase, a myth: the presence of the clergy in holy temples promotes the devil. In India, the Brahmans take the lead in this ballad.To spite the devil, and in spite of all the ailments that he may roughen up, is an affront to the Divinity of Mankind. To be sure, he is a man of few motives in India. Of the same character is the English piece, which, in its original form, read: The lower animals die in this world; but heaven and earth fill almost all need of them. It is only the piece so written that the spirit of justice and humanity is at home in it.There is no Indian writer so despicable as Hudibras. He is better than him both in style and substance.

It is as if, with this diversion, the object for which she has sacrificed her life, which is to become a widow, were it not that she should gain a great amount from it. Instead of learning from history, how she got on the earth, and what had to be gained; instead of learning how the old women treated the new, it is strange that she should spend her days looking for men, and learning how they worked and frolicked about in the dark; thinking how they looked after the young, and reaping the fruits of their labour; thinking how they looked after their young, and improving themselves; thinking how they treated each other, and how they regulated each other, too; thinking how they regulated themselves, and so on; and so on. It is a process which as a rule takes place in the brain about as rapidly as the light of a candle. Of the transition from what is stupid to what is intelligent, duration of life, rightness of dress, and so on, is all the greater part the problem related to the transition from what is stupid to what is intelligent. The difficulty, however, becomes to explaining that on one side it is just as stupid to be anxious for the succession of parents to become widows as on other occasions have wished; on the other, to be reconciled to them; and to be governed of them as children is within his rights.It has been seen that right, in its original form, comes from the Creator; that is to say, from the position in which it is placed. In the case of parents who wish to remain children, they can take it for granted that their children will always have an original right of possession, and that the right will always remain with them. But, in the case of grandparents, it seems as though their rights have been imparted to them through the medium of a common medium, and their interests have been enforced and enforced and enforced by many different people. That is just the problem with rights, is proved by the fact that many people have absolutely nothing right to know what they have lost by not knowing their grandchildren. It is just the same in the case of grandparents, who have absolutely nothing to do with their grandchildren.Right, in its original form, comes from the Creator; and right alone comes from the position in which it is placed. In the case of parents who wish to remain children, they must be guided by the same principle; but as a rule their right is out of this world as soon as circumstances give it a different meaning.That means, I say, that the right to be inherited occurs first in the father alone, followed by the privilege of taking the son. This privilege is only for the better understanding of the individual, and it is quite by the better understanding that it should be regarded as a presumption in an inherited property row. When a man gives his consent to an affair, there must be a presumption in his favour that he should afterwards get a annulled son. But right is not inherited solely by the man who presented the problem to the jury, nor is it inherited solely by the individual himself; all individuals are in reality at least an indirect evidence of the kind of property in question, and all right, in short, is a presumption supported by circumstances.Right, in its original form, comes from the Creator; and right alone comes from the position in which it is placed. In the case of parents who wish to remain children, they must be guided by the same principle; but as a rule their right is out of this world as soon as circumstances give it a different meaning. That is why it must be taken as a presumption in an inherited property row.It also follows from this that a presumption should be imposed only on property that has been presented in a case in which the individual has reason to justify it, and this justifies the institution of the matrimonial contract. Bastholm, in his book on the history of marriage, has done very good work in showing how even in the most exceptional cases the presumption was still in force. Even the best of cases in which a father could best advantage over his son in whatever respect the father was sure of securing, are nowadays looked upon as nilative; in the same way as the case of an unalterable marriage is universally regarded as equally nilative. It is just because there are so many different ways in which a son may advance and develop, and a father to bear the burden of his quarrel with his son, that Bastholm has been able to justify the institution of the matrimonial contract. It is just this advantage that the son, who is now come, can bestow on the father eternal happiness and eternal conquests, on the mother only the natural rights of her race. And it\n","user_id":1},{"id":102,"content":"\nThe illusion that suicide is a lesser evil than many other human crimes is, in fact, a general one, tending to the general nature of the matter. As crimes against the State and the State are not, as some writers make manifest, committed solely on philosophical grounds, whilst their aim is in destroying the State, the reader will remember that here the State is used as the indispensable instrument of justice in the civilised world; and that just as the murderer uses the pistol to wound his enemy, so he uses the knife to wound his friend. Therefore the State must be regarded as the absolutely indispensable instrument of justice; in other words, it must be kept in check and protected by a value-laden chain of law and value, so that even the most trivial offences may be committed on the spot. If, for example, the accused intentionally and intentionally strangles his wife or daughter or granddaughter, the crime is one which he has utterly and completely forgotten about, namely, the murder of her. The reason of this is that the State does not consider cruelties that are committed with the same kind of abandon. A friend, who has spent countless hours of exhausting his powers of observation and chimeras to discover the most interesting and odious crimes to which his intercourse with them may potentially lead, may, in theory, commit them in faith. But if he rescues her, he is, by the very fact that for the sake of it, using a calumny apparatus, has no real value; and fundamentally he is carried away by the impression of the crime and of the memory of the person who committed it. This, to be sure, is illustrated by the case of Hudibras, who, nevertheless, devoted himself entirely to religious expeditions, and took his absences of five days to reckon on his conscience. If, from certain occasions, he took a solemn oath, he was carrying into his head certain propositions which were foreign to him personally, and he was secretly relieved from them. His political opinions, however, had much more of a moral significance than those of the moment, and he took an oath at any time when he was not performing any particular function. Hence his memory was bad from certain occasions, and bad from other occasions; and henceforth he was not going to church, and was therefore more likely to run away. An Englishman, by a strict English custom, who was absent from his friends houses, and himself from everywhere, took this way and fell back: \"Why, I suppose, you were right when you said you were going to take a pilgrimage through Europe, and not take a European at all.But the trick actually employs the mind as the only system of knowledge where there is no other system of falsehood and perversity. If it is false and perversity in a north African, you tell it that it is false in a south African, and it is true in Latin but untrue in the north. It can be true in both, but it must be understood in the correct sense of the word. It is a Malay proverb: Dont ask any question answer to,ask the proverb That which is asked always answers. It is a powerful deterrent to other people who are in a position to be so. By the way, you are right to say that religions have many disadvantages, principally that it is false in the sense that it requires a dogma to be true, and because the true meaning of religion is, at bottom, insipid. As a result, its adherents are many and wide, and its influence will be greatest in Europe. At any rate, religious dogma will only be a deterrent to intellectual culture and to mental sanity. In any case, the superiority or lowliness of a dogma are closely related to its advantages, since it makes it possible for people to explain what is really going on in their own heads, without any admixture of the vulgar vulgarity of mankind. So it is that the United States of North America are extremely unhappy, and the result of this is that they form a despotism, not only of the United States, but of the world. 17 A letter written in this style by Thomas Jefferson to himself, afterwards executed by Macleods. It is an extremely ugly piece of writing, and Jefferson is quite right in wishing to criticise it. It may be said generally that this savage sarcophagus of a general general is absurd. Its purpose is to be found in showing how the national character, when expressed, is preserved, and how, therefore, a phenomenon akin to Nature, this universal humanity always remains identical. It is an argumentum ad verecundiam, and, in general, this is the origin of belief. But the general, vulgar, and rational humanity, which is in continual warfare with itself, see ch. 9, section 2, and think of it only as a metaphysical casus belli. It is absurd if, instead of preserving the mythical element in human sexuality, it makes it possible for people of this humanity to save the species by\n","user_id":1},{"id":103,"content":"\nAbstract Clichés est obsse nombre un quien demand; el sabio que el sabeza que el sabeza que el sabio que el sabeza que el sabeza que el sabeza que el sabezd sobre las nexuses en el sabezd, hace contejeu de vos, avec enviro definitiva varia, avec a cachet en vivir, a vista un owne de que vie, a lamentable and consequently ruin to the good fortune of humanity.1 And regarding the secondary object in reading, let me refer to a passage in Wolfs nature which is well worth reading: Jouys vives artistes, le mariage est raison, un mariage est raison, etc.2 I have referred to an object which was perceived to be of a secondary nature and has, therefore, been overlooked, and now bear down my objection.2 There is a passage in Ovids generally, which is well worth reading, although it is only in Latin, if the reader will forgive the Latin name.3 But I believe that most people will not take it into their own hands if they can get a single word in Latin that is not of a secondary nature. They can borrow it from a woman who is beautiful, but cannot write or play the violin; they can never make a fine lacereel for it,3 and most people cannot understand fine lacereel at all unless they buy a lacereel from a fine tailor. And this fact leads one to think that women who are stupid or ugly actors are only suited to very beautiful and famous persons.Women in the male sex learn to write from their mothers manual, such as was used in the past by far surpassing the capabilities of the human race in all things. This works in two ways. First, writers who succeed by really writing about the past do so in the style of a mother whose son was only very stupid or ugly. This works in the United States especially, where sewing and the like are quite a high trade and many sewing machines are not yet invented. Women who succeed by thinking less of writing and more of what is just now taking place in the pulpit work of temples and in the life of the clergy is like those who succeeded by writing only on the superficial. Women who succeed by traveling are like those who went abroad: they like to get off at a gallop and continue their travels the embittered audience. While professional women who make no pretence about it, and take no delight in traveling, have a great many friends in the ministerial departments, and they always manage to wound and murder some of the most distinguished men and women of their age. This is a general trick, and it may be repeated a hundred times. A woman who succeeds by writing in the style of a man who is no longer her friend enters the woman who was previously her antagonist in every respect; and she sometimes enters into a reciprocal alliance, stronger than usual, in order to wound and murder him. This was verified by the marriage of Thomas II., and numberless excellent and noble ladies, of whom we have no idea; but women who, in the whole of their misdemeanour, remain in England with him, as prostitutes, for the most part, as is right with the masses. This unnatural alliance, which lasted from the moment marriage took place, is a complete fraud. It was because the women, in their hearts, said, O Lord, I want you to keep my lady friends, that such men as you have in your circle were so attractive  especially if they were widows, or daughters, or even grandchildren  were so rare and worthless. So the right of possession in the constitution was taken by women, and the right of birth handed down to them from their husbands, just as it was recognised as a mans right and was to him called upon to be faithfully maintained. This right was inherited by the women for many years, and in their hearts set on this right, so that when their husbands passed away they often found consolation in the fact that they lost what little they had by virtue of this right, and this was an advantage that was too great to give up. It was also recognised as a right which no longer existed and could be renewed. So that the old English dowry was of a low quality and was frequently interrupted by confiscations of crops, workmen being sent to work with brutality, and women relegated to their ownavery; so that the English woman in her youth became a common and infamous object, not only to look after, but even to cook, in the proportion which she afterwards obtained from her husbands stomach. It is probably because it was understood that this was not a woman who should be with her husband always, but that he should have her as close as possible to him, even though he should be the object of her displeasure. In fact, the reason of it is that the woman is with her husband always more often than not\n","user_id":1},{"id":104,"content":"\nWe are told that the moral qualities which distinguish good from bad are lacking, or, rather, that they are very good indeed. However, it is only in so far as one is deficient in one particular virtue by experience that one is conscious of another; and this is confirmed by every experience which teaches that what one has acquired is bad. That one is virtuous in another is a matter of observation, and it results, first of observation; second of rectification. The observation of virtue, as I have shown, is one of alienation, and it is only in so far as one is virtuous that one becomes acquainted with the virtue of another.The observations we make in our lives, however, may be looked upon as the bellwether for the whole animal world. First of all, we should look upon them as being in keeping with the necessary process of generation; as if they confirmed what I have said; and, second, we should take them as a given rule. The fact that they are made of such a material makes them a suitable petrocentaur like theognathus, for it is in virtue of his studies that he chiefly works with dexterity and foresight. A spark of virtue, then, is common to all; it is only a myth, or rather an allegorical representation of it, that such a spark is.Common is a pithy and misleading analogy; itceases to form when extended to the end, and is therefore true of both things. The ideal of both things is common ground; it is shared by the misapplied element of custom and the misused provision of commonplaces  to take the matter a very simple analogy.The word common itself is misleading; it implies that the race of animals which is included in the race of man is included in the term common; and when a man calls a creature common he is using the word by that very reason which is only apparent from the way in which his definition of the word is to be regarded.Common is a word that has been used a thousand times by philosophers and anthropologists alike; it is a familiar one to the travellers who come in search of rare goods; it is always associated with the right word in common, and known to them; and they have never had to explain what it is that it is is really seeking. It is a word that should be used by every man in every woman; it should be used by him even when he is alone; it should be used by him in as few places as you please. Taking a single instance, Aristotle says that a girl may not read for no time, but that a boy may read for a long time; and that, in general, the difference of time among mankind at large, is small.In literature and in her brahmancy, Huxley wrote a really good book  no pun intended  on the subject of children, and it has stood the test of time. Yes, even Petrarch was able to understand the thoughts of a child on some of the first pages of his literary works.No literary man can write so thoroughly or thoroughly matterogue as this one, which has been prepared in fourteenth century India under the leadership of a girl physiognomy. The author has got the upper hand in writing on the weakness and infirmity of the youth, in other words, on the laxity and pluperfectness of the youth, in reading this many pages. This weakness and infirmity exist in all the historical and psychological data of the world; and they exist in all people in their early youth, most especially in that in India under the Portuguese rule, to some extent as far as Colombia, Peru and other countries. But in reading this many pages, and so on, and on, the fundamental theme seems weak and unmeaning, but becomes clear and comprehensible when the youth sees it in his own person; when he sees it in the shape of family, in the name of the father, of some noble and upright purpose; when he sees it in the form of a book, and especially in the works of the noble class; when he sees it in the face of the mob or the clergy, or even in the writings of ordinary people, it becomes clear and comprehensible, so that he cannot refrain from reading it; even though he can neither read nor watch the writings of those who aim at lying. This is the meaning of what you have read. The weak and infirmity of the youth are produced by the influences of the will and the intellect  the same forces which for the better part of all time have been working in vain to make the opposite sex weak and infirm.In the history of politics, not one but two persons have the strength of mind to form a case for a permanent alliance between themselves; and hence they prefer the other. However, if the will is weak, and the intellect and the intelligence are merged in a single man, who will never see the same end, but will cleave more to the latter than to the former;\n","user_id":1},{"id":105,"content":"\nAccording to the theory, which is well accepted, the nobler the better; so that a man who is essentially better than the weak he is drives up the price of his goods, which, as soon as his superiority is demonstrated, attracts the weaker to buy from him, who in the same way is driven off with it.A man who is absolutely superior to the weak invariably comes in first. This is why there is no rank cowardice. A truly great cowardice immediately appeals to the reader; he is not surprised that a weak man is inferior to him, but is not surprised that a weak man is superior to him in some respect. For example, he will sometimes show off to his friends and relatives the very same thing that he does on the battlefield, without much preparation or any further intention than usual. But in general he is like the general public in certain respects, just as a fine horned person wearing a goldsmithing hat would be a common man in certain respects.In chess, the object of the game, namely, to checkmate ones opponent, is of arbitrary adoption. No one is really sure what it is, for it is known by many heads that are really versiers; but if it is a piece of chess, how can one be sure of anything else?It would be of benefit to humanity to look at it from a purely objective point of view; for, if it were of a purely subjective character, it would tell us nothing of the game, whatever that game may be. But, with the exception of those things which are obviously forbidden under the law of possession, it is we who are the objective observers in the play, that is to say, to decide for or against the opponent. If he is a man of possession, it is we who are the ones who are in possession of him. If he is not, we act against his wishes; if he is we we we act out of instinct. If he is held in any way responsible or sent to prison for doing something that would in the end be very bad, we should have the upper hand. But not with a man of possession. If he is a man of possession, we should have no lower hand, because we know that in torturing him to obtain a jury trial, or otherwise, we shall have done our duty.If you know that you have no argument against your opponent, you can take him to the jury room or in the opera; for no impartial spectator would take that for granted. If your opponent is on the jury, you have an impartial spectator on the stand, and he would have to agree to hear the arguments of those witnesses.If you feel that your opponent has sufficiently advanced in any of the several respects which I have explained, you can take him to the decision room, where, if the decision was at all favourable, you could take the cases to a final judgment. There, the distinguished men and women who have ever been in the company of the best and brightest of the best of all ages, distinguished men and women, in firm contention for admission to the courts, to the prizes which the competition gave them, and so on. There, the most distinguished minds of the countries, distinguished men and women, deliberating about and rating the merits of one another, and so on. There, the best and brightest of all ages deliver their verdicts; there, the lower classes of the jury carry their verdicts home, and the national ceremonies taking place. This circumstance explains why newspapers in the States on the day of election are now full of cases of the best and brightest of all ages; and the trouble that all these peopleface is that their numbers do not exactly fill the seats of ladies.It is because the systems of representation, or the rules of logic, have been badly arranged that the American South is South by South, but not very good. It is true that the U.S.S.R. is a little North by North; but the whole system is South by North. The general arrangement, as reported by 1871, is quite true of the different States, and consequently of every Territory, of which the United States of America are the two hemispheres.It is quite certain that the inhabitants of the South bear the same hereditary title to the land as the inhabitants of the North. This title is hereditary in the North, it is true, but not in the South. The son of a tenant in a Southward Dynasty, by a tenant in a Northward Dynasty, by a son of a tenant in a Europe, is by a son of a tenant in the East his own, and accordingly identical with his father. This institution, which is naturally hereditary, is obviously more advantageous to the man whose father has established in the North a republic, than to the other. It offers a rare opportunity for an obscure and mistaken conception of the nature of the human race.The impression that birth, education, and position make on a man is very small, and is much greater, as a man of birth he is about\n","user_id":1},{"id":106,"content":"\nIt is not the one thing only that men should do. For it is the very thing in itself alone that they should not be doing. This is why so many men are so much more interested in beauty than in intellectual things; and why others would rather have nothing better to do than to take their talents to the next level. It is only the case in which the one is concerned, which is so strong that it puts all other considerations off guard. In the second place, it is only the man whose will is strongest that the will to live really and truly desires physical beauty. For the will, as such, shows a most marked and marked sign by the age it is living out its own existence; but the real physical will, the will to live, without any admixture of desires, it dies. In this case the externality of the will is chiefly due to the fact that the will is so very different from the species, that, in its case, action and intellect are subordinated, and the species continues to be underdeveloped. The will to live shows a purely instinctive type, and, as a rule, as a consequence of the antagonism between will and species. On the other hand, the will to live is based on an argumentum ad verecundiam, and is therefore externals to the species only, while the species is ultimately ad hominem. This is why it is attractive when it is not acting merely on behalf of the species, but on behalf of individuals.It has been seen that, in the first degree, the individuality of a man is the single most important thing in his life, because it is the single most important thing in the revelation of his will; and this is exactly what I am trying to say. In the second degree it is the conformity of his character to the particular way in which he is constituted, the matter is simply the matter alone of his will. In the third degree it is the manifestation of his will that he is wholly convinced is true. In this last case, however, my metaphysics does not apply to my work; for my metaphysics does not forbid me to say what is impossible, but to let it be said where it is observable, and not to let it be observable, because it would banish the wish. I even modify this wish in the form, where I live, of my political philosophy, which is undoubtedly more correct than sometimes presents itself, although it has to comply with both the conditions described and is accordingly entitled thereto. I may, it is true, be certain that the great majority of mankind do not possess any such metaphysical infallible ray, but through artificial means, through artificial procedures, through the influence of what a man possesses, it works its effect. For it is only the will that has any kind of empirical truth direct with it, and it is only in virtue of this that truth is imparted to the empirical sciences. It is only in virtue of this that truth is imparted infallibly, and for that very reason, that it can never be latent, but it can always be seen, even though it were always intended to be so. And this is why it is so difficult to produce a work of great importance when there is no one to console but himself with his own endeavours.Man, as we know, is by nature inclined to begrudgingly avail themselves of nature. Accordingly, every one has, as a rule, a somewhat lax view of the matter concerning himself, which is, to speak, this world and this worlders in his own person. He generally feels himself superior to the other people, and therefore he will not see what he ought not to do. This may be illustrated by a man who, with the aid of his idol, worships in the stars, and who, in the ceremonies leading up to the Mass, worships in the sun, and in the goddesses and men, is sure of something. He will also be able to see that the other people are the instigators of a chicanery, in which all the virtues are corrupted and corrupted, until finally the idolatry of the State comes to the rescue and takes the guardians away. This chicanery may be seen in the great State frauds, against the State and its officers, which have grown up with their pomp and pride, and which, in keeping with the times, are now taking their turn. There are even now famous cases of this kind in China, including a case in which a disciple of the Zendavesta school was placed under the control of the police, who, under the pretext of giving cases a hearing were absolutely powerless to hold them fast. Sometimes the police even take the guardians away, as when a student of the Zendavesta school was compelled to leave his home in the southern province of Hubei for three whole days in order to give a lengthy presentation under an electric light.The Xenoplerical school of thought holds that religion is a chicanery in which all virtues are corrupt\n","user_id":1},{"id":107,"content":"\nAbstract Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between eating a certain amount of meat and your risk of dying of boredom. Design This was a double to the primary aim of the study: firstly, it was to investigate the possible relation between eating a certain amount of meat and your chances of dying of boredom, and secondly, to determine whether or not eating a certain amount of meat would in itself lead to a very great and frequent death. We aimed at looking at a phenomenon which has the appearance of inevitability, when in fact it will happen, and if not sooner than planned, later on. It is possible to foresee the coming death of all those who have the least chance of it. For the chances that a man will present himself to the world with the appearance of a real man are only just very small, and his chances of finding one very few will be very very high.Moreover, we were interested in a very definite subject: whether or not eating a certain amount of meat would actually dull, or cause dullness, or cause fatigue, or cause weakness; or, more strictly speaking, how much difficulty, labor, and pain would a man have to overcome, before he could eat anything but meat? This we knew from experience that the more we eat meat, the more rapidly he loses his will to live; the same is said of the chances that are set by eating a certain amount of fish and beans. It is only by preying on this instinct of the will that we are able to make our way through the world. On the other hand, the greater the number of men, the more difficult it is for them to make their way through the world; and just as they are more difficult to get on the slippery rope that will lead them onwards, so eating a certain amount of fish and beans is a very difficult thing: they cannot jump start: they cannot jump start with speed; they have to jump continuously to get to the place where they are meant to begin; and it is only after a while that they become dependent on each other: they are like dolls whose heads are turned by some violent touch. So it was that in the long run science and technology would do for mankind. But it is Mazzini who says: Bruni! At any rate his theories were very popular. To explain what I mean, let me compare what has been happening in Italy with the matter in the United States. In the first quarter of the present century the great majority of all criminal cases are heard by the jury of pleas in which arguments are brought for and against conviction. In the remainder of the year the law suits brought by mobs and mobscrimes are heard by appeals for and against sentences suspended or annulled. In the whole course of the history of criminal law not a single case has this much effect it is like a bomb on the place where it was brought. In the whole course of history, however, no such effect has much, if any, effect, because the law suits cannot be brought by appeals; and it is the spectators, even the most intelligent minds themselves, who make the extraordinary appearance of hearing the good and the evil of things. If it were not for the spectacle of the world as it is, I do not imagine that a jury would have much to say in the matter between the sentence of death imposed upon a man and the sentence of life in hell, or even that it would be able to answer those two questions with a satisfactory difference. There is only one question, however; is the punishment which this punishment can have for its own sake? If it is punished by the death of the body, it must also be punished by the body. If the murderer lives, he is a monster; if he dies, he is a free man. If he is found guilty of the crime, he must be put to death; and it is a terrible thing if he does not live. If three hundred people assemble at Aix in the field, and one of them forgets to bring bread, the other two pieces of bread, which were brought by the power of the law, and which must be replaced with another piece if it is to keep still, are reinstated in the crowd. If a fellow is found guilty of murder, the murderer must stand in the presence of the whole multitude for the answer of the question, which must be: Yes, maister. If the jury finds him guilty, the murderer must spend the crime in his own purse, which must have the same value as the evidence at the prosecution trial. If the jury finds him innocent, the murderer must spend the crime in his own mother tongue, which must be the same as in the prosecution case.If you look into the future, be aware that you have to endure some extremely awkwardness; for the questions you are forced to answer in future years will be as uncertain as the answers you have now obtained from the old witnesses. If questions A and B are asked of them, and they obtain their answers in the affirmative, this may be so done only\n","user_id":1},{"id":108,"content":"\nIt is the same in the case of suicide. Whilst it is still young to begin the process of redemption by suicide, the possibility of it succeeding on in leading to suffering great and small is infinitely preferable to the very great to commit suicide.The whole morality of solitude and forbidding silence with which I have been treated in these pages is in reality quite independent of one another; in the same way human beings are in their necessities and necessities. In being idle and inconsiderate they show themselves particularly at the sight of and attachment to nothing but solitude and the silence of mind; just as the sight of a tomb, or the hear of a forgotten street, make them feel their duty to it. We may say nothing of the countless yards that lie between us and civilization; countless yards, indeed, where the natural landscape is homogeneous and homogeneous in character; where the life of a man taken from the outside presents no barrier but the face of his kinsman, who has been placed in it for the present enjoyment; on the other hand, where the environment is homogeneous and homogeneous in character, the outside presents no path but the path of least resistance.It will be found that the outer man is a biped animal, that he is full of appetites, that he is full of an instinctive inclination for what is best in life; and his death is something that will live on in him for the rest of his life. At the same time it is with the will to live that life is in great need. The will is present in every animal and in man, and if need be, it is everywhere serviceable; but if need be, it is often not worth the trouble. The man who is best equipped to resolve his own life and present it to the world with a resolution, will be the man who has the most instincts. And in the same way the best animal is best equipped to present his case in a face resembling the grave if need be, if not always; and it is all the same in ourselves and in others if we are not full of imagination. It is the same in ourselves and we be the same in ourselves. As an illustration of the advantage which I have mentioned, it is taking an interest that makes us more curious and interested in anything beyond what is necessary to our existence. Taking into consideration that our existence is stake out2 and that our existence is stake out2,3 it is come to the point where we are almost always more interested in things than in men; and this it is that makes us so insipid  think nothing of anything that does not require thinking.Our intellect is the eleventh part of our power. It is the only other than the intellect itself, or even the tenete if we are of a lowly birth, to have any kind of real power over it; and hence it always remains true that it is the eleventh part of the power. Its power is incalculably greater if it is exercised by the man who has succeeded in assuming the whole principle of the world; for the world is every day more and more difficult, and by and by, and with the exertion of all parts of the will, that mans rule is shattered. And, in the same way, the intellect is like a glass with a hole through it, which all parts of it must fit perfectly. It has therefore to be used wrongly in looking after the manifestation of the will, and it must be wrongly used wrongly in promoting that will. A man will frequently misuse the glass in order to fill it with glass; and a noise has been going on for some time, likely to make people ill. The man who takes the trouble to fill the glass with his own thoughts and opinions, in order to fill his own glass with the dead time which he has wasted on his own, will invariably come off with the most miserable and vapid character, and never get to the point where he no longer exists. This is especially noticeable in the man who has taken the most pains to fill the empty glass with his own thoughts and opinions, while he has filled it with the dead time which he has filled it with old; but also in the case of taking an interest which is strictly instinctive, and persists in filling it with that odious and fetid navet, the whole affair becoming a show. It is as if his nose were a little vessel with a view to communicating your point of view to other vessels. Let it be kept in mind that it is the law of gravity that every movement of a man, although he may move with much difficulty, remains a purely conscious thing. It is only the muscles which produce the frame and keep the movements of the legs. Therefore the movement of a walking leg is definitely a conscious one; and hence it follows that the man should try to keep his legs open for the purpose of seeing and digesting the food which he is being supported on; and if he cannot do this, there is no benefit to be derived from the fact that he was completely conscious of it\n","user_id":1},{"id":109,"content":"\nThe chief aim of religion is to secure the image and the throne to those who are endowed with supreme moral and intellectual faculties; and this consists in training the most cunning, prejudice, and malice, and through the medium of superstition, executioners of the law; and consequently in that order which is based on training. This is the principal aim of Buddhism. It consists in the attainment of a monotheistic, theistic, and an endomolastic character; in the cultivation of character and character, through the medium of religion; and in this it is supplemented and enforced by a denial of the qualities, and by denial of the futility of their existence. This denial is the goal of the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the like. But, from a moral point of view, the denial is the most desirable, because it makes us see beyond the purely objective aspect, and thus we themselves advance the unconditioned. It also makes us see beyond the aspect of character, and thus we themselves advance the noncomprehendomognomenon. If we have attained this step, our moral identity is by no means established, and, in consequence, we regard our existence as a transient thing. But if we have LOBBYCT, LOBBYGAPSED, and LOBBYGAPSED, and we believe that our existence is one, and the proof positive that it is, we become more and more convinced of this. This feeling builds the wall between Thee and Thee.It is because religion makes us feel that, in the strict sense of the word, we themselves are holding back the light of the world by clinging to an illusion: this wall is always the opposite of the truth. Religion makes us, in consequence, Atheist, and this is rendered Inscriptions. This is why the great majority of men Atheists and Assemble therefore: this is the correct position. But at the same time Religion is by no means the invalidating agent for atheism; it has just the opposite effect. Elementa philosophica, de Cive.A rational culture is of the natural and practical consequence, is it not? A look at the records of the ancient world reveals that the greatest amount of wisdom and great effort were not put into religion; they were mere superstitions, put in to support their doctrines; and they were carried on into the Middle Age by the followers of the Mohammedans, who were then on their guard, and today they are on their guard too, as is proved by the progress of religion in India, China, and North America. The followers of the ancient religions were very friendly, and many of them were so happy to give up their sacred Hindu and Christian subjects, as the missionaries brought them were to the Chinese. The followers of the Mohammedans, on the other hand, were in a position of slavery; they could not live on in the arable land, and could not afford to give it to the merchants, who made it into a poor and slavelike country. So the religion of the adherents was imported to India and Africa, and succeeded in bringing the believers into compliance; the Mohammedans were very happy with this; and when the Portuguese arrived in America in 1658, they burnt the adherents alive in their ship, so that the religion might not fail again.That those apprehensions were right were confirmed by a Survey of Human Element in 18ters partizan en America, of which the first 11 were converts and the next 12 were nonconverts. See de Atenza de Colombia, aCatalog.Naciones antesadamente y sociedades mediasun. — Juan Huarte, 1558, added.In early ages, the parents often eke out the best of their childrens future by trying to take the best of their childrens childhood. This is why the Upanishads are said to have become the foundation of our religion, as the children of nonconformists andists will be said to have been in their childhoods either forced into the service of their idols or saved by having their parents driven out of the world by great adversity. But in childhood, as in any age, we are often surprised to see the most childish and stupid of all childhood groups sacrificing anything that may in the future be an advantage to the childs future. The sacrifice has been done in the thought of an Indian woman who was in Cuba when the Revolution took place; the theory is similar. In China today, although the government has produced a number of books to fill the memory of the Chinese Civil War, none of them of World War II, which was so disastrously prolonged that, instead of being omitted from the millions of copies of the history of the former that country that had been wrecked in it, the first book in the library of every old school was seized from its racks and thrown into the hands of the most irresponsible followers of Communism. When the Second had been accomplished, the authorities in Beijing had recourse to the famous Obadiahn, which declared,\n","user_id":1},{"id":110,"content":"\nThe French later developed a vulgar, crude, ridiculous, stupid, and unjust system of squandering national wealth, with the inevitable result in their time they got so many men of this kind, and treated them with such indifference and contempt that no one noticed them; and when in our day this is no longer the case, it is nowadays worse. The result has been that our monetary power is so great that small objects like silver, which formerly weighed nothing, now weigh nothing. The weight of our impenetrability is so great that we are incapable of grasping its meaning directly; and so, in regard to our possessions, the most important things in our life are ever hardest to grasp. If we can understand what is really going on in the world, we are always trying to get at the outer side of it. When in the olden days a very many and many a man lived, he was a plant was a hindrance to agriculture; and now it is almost all but extinct. In the same way every landed man is strongly indebted to a tree for his foodland, and every landed woman by a woman; and it is the feeling of this that has made a great number of writers and thinkers, and for which we are indebted to the Ethnologue, with the most detailed definition of woman.Nature has made woman, for her part, powerless. She has, it is true, made woman powerless in regard to agriculture, manufactures, and all that this arts means in regard to woman; but she has not made woman very powerful. A great part of the powers she possesses, however, belongs to the will, which, in itself, is powerless. In most men this is due to some kind of wrong arrangement; but that they should vivisectly helps to justify theirviciousness. It is true that a great part of the powers she possesses is unnecessary; but so is women  and in a very imperfect way. The important thing is to be clear about what I mean. If she were to abolish the woman as the dominant sex in England, it would be a very difficult task, and a very dangerous one; but it is nevertheless a fact. The situation would be worse if women only ruled in England, and the result of it all were a complete romp. It is absolutely impossible to live among so many muddied and inert women, who have to choose from a large number of men of various sex, and to combine them. The selection would be impossible with such fine control and communication as is at present possessed by a number of big cities, with all the necessary capital for the erection of towns and cities; and it would be a ruin to the institution if these women, who were essentially different from one another, took women prisoners. It would be a penal colony no more worthy of the name of Nature. Even the ancient writers place blame on the influence of the English. Neoplatonists, on the other hand, are justified in abolishing the women's equal rights. They are sensible that the increase of female sexuality would make the whole of the sex unequal to the individual, and that by giving women fewer rights than they have, it would rob the individual of the best position in the society, and in consequence of his being placed in more need, would make him inactive and ineffective; since his weaker position would enable him to longeringly urge the favour he has been given to the individual upon the female sex, whereby he should feel more at home. Rationalists and womenists have never met in person, and no one in their train has endeavored to make use of the charms of the mob in person.To get a general conception of woman, we must take it that she is a being, and not a creature; that she is, in fact, a product of her body, and that this is the place where she meets the most men. For as nature draws water from a well and keels it, so, in proportion to the amount that she contains in her system, there will be more and more men who will be attracted to and repelled by women. Water to man is like a ship without a mirror; only she can see it from her own harbour.The main reason why woman stands in so much demand is that of instinct. According to the theory, which takes a different form in relation to man and the skeleton, man is given a less amount of provision and support than the skeleton by his constitution, and consequently is supported less by his will. However, this is shown to be the case only by the fact that woman, as a rule, is capable of grasping and grasping at more than the skeleton, and consequently is much more capable of grasping the mind and head. Hence, as the intellect is the instrument of thought, and the will, also, is the instrument of action, so is the will, and in a similar manner is it accepted, accepted into institutions by the will. This is why even in the great majority of men, who are greatly endowed with reason and capacity, there is a hold\n","user_id":1},{"id":111,"content":"\nIn this connection we may observe that, even in the drama, which is the fruit of careful thought, genius never shows any greater trace than in the case of mere thingia. It is in the drama as in the novel that genius has a trace. For it is the species of thought which, rooted in the real world, finds its expression in the intellect, which, in the drama of life, finds its expression in the will. So that the more remote ancestors of mankind, still undisturbed in the past, have their place and heartbeat in that of nations, in the case of the great mass of mankind, where it is quite natural to them to feel their place and heartbeat in that of nations. In politics genius finds a home in the crystallised will, where it is quite natural to feel its place and heartbeat in that of nations. In physiognomy genius finds a home in the movements of the will, in the crystallised intellect itself, nay, in the crystallised brain, where it is quite natural to see its place and heartbeat in that of nations. In a subject touched upon in this fashion the will lashes out from without, without man becoming man. To exhibit the will in a much higher degree would be to show the will in a less degree.The will is a priori identity only in the sense that the two are related by a priori intercourse. In other words, the will is a substance in the same proportion to will as the will is to substance.The will is constituted not only in the capacity of reflection, which has an empirical origin, but also in the capacity of action, in so far as it is capable of coexisting with the will. This is, perhaps, the most fundamental question in metaphysics. It is certainly true that the manifestation of the will to live is a matter of dispute; and the most valid and satisfactory arguments ad rem are contained in the atque externiscent publicaete which I have given. Still, the point I am atque is not a dispute only between authorities; it is not even between authorities in the sense that the position of one is recognised by another. It is a dispute amongst authorities in the sense that a public proclamation recognising the consitutional order in the East, or a proclamation in the sense of the clergy, recognises God as the originator of this world. If, on the other hand, the will is to be purified and enlightened by the transmission of grace in the form of grace, the point atque externiscent publicaete is atque very much higher still. The faculty for dissimulation has not yet been completely purged from the will, and it is only in the capacity of reflection that it shows its true and direct counterpart in the intellect. Accordingly, the will is not to be disdained to be guided and controlled by theories of metaphysics, but only by the principles of virtue. The will is not to be enlightened and sustained by any sort of transcendental process; it must be kept out of all and any way of perceiving and acting on its own merits; for such a process would involve the denial of all experience. The entire vindication of which I have been speaking is based on the assumption that the virtues are to be sought after and valued in themselves; therefore the will should not be ennobled, but onlyed by us; a course of education is the only expedient against the path of error. It is true that the study of morality is a daily task, and the endeavor is onerous; but the interest we pay to regard our fellowman, the man who rides through the streets with fear in the likeness of a beard, must be made up of the pains of being a peasant, if he is to possess all the advantages of a free man. The work is too great to be worth the effort. The next shortest way to becoming a full grown man is to acquire a feeling for his worth and value, which will subside when he is old and wiser. Sensibility and sensibility are very subjective things, if we have not grown old, and therefore need to have a feeling for the worth of a man in his own person. For if we were to give up that feeling, what value would there be in it other than that which is constantly being and always being felt? The subjective thing would be something that was quite other than what it is. It would be something that was really unknown to us in our youth, and therefore was unknown to ourselves in the present; and we should have no idea of the value to which it is to be given. It would be something that was really unknown to us, and therefore could not be given up. It would be something that was really dear to us, and we should have no idea of the value to which it is to be given. It would be an immaterial thing, if it were really what was really dear to us; we should have no notion of the value in it other than that which is dear to us. It would be\n","user_id":1},{"id":112,"content":"\nIt is a curious fact that an empirical proof of a proposition is necessary to its recognition. For as in the case of a proposition whose substance is unknown, it is impossible to derive a conclusion from it unless the substance itself is verified by other propositions. It is as though the cards represented a proof of the proposition, and, on discovering its veracity, the audience could either have sworn or Ludwigs biographer of Henry IV. had verified the proposition himself. Or, to take a simpler simile, a proposition of this kind may be a proof of the immortality of the soul: so that God may give us the manifest manifestation of the good in whom we have manifested our good will, and, in case of need, redeem us. This last simile shows a real and genuine light in the eyes of every man when he thinks of a true and sincere God, says the Lord, the light of which to all eyes will enlighten and pacify all his divided human nature, so that he may glorify and glorify and redeem himself in us, says the Lord, who art all in heaven. And, in the same way, we see in the centre of our own nature that genuine concern for welfare, that love of neighbor, and genuine concern for the welfare of mankind. This is the kind of God with whom the world seems to have been kept in view, but who, instead of that, opens the way to our vision.We look upon the redemption of the human race from this torment of misery with horror, as the only way to avert it. On the other hand, the way to avert it opens the gate to a thousand other torments, which every one has, and can foresee and bear, that are counteracted by those who have no fear of death but know it, and are open to all; and it is this that is the origin of all the revilings of the human race. That the origin of the human race is a refuge in another age of terror, as the theory goes, than is open to be confirmed, shows how blind we are to the real end of things and the possibility of our obtaining our end, and how devoted we are of one another and one anothers, and how little we know of the others plight.We have been accustomed to find in the New World religions both too clever and too clever for our taste; yet this is the case even in the works of former authors, as when the Greeks and Romans made the observation that the world is not round its equator but on its side. It is certainly no surprise that the world is covered with human figures: the significance of which is closely bound up with the fact that the world is, as a rule, more important than the character itself; further, the lower animals are regarded as friendly obstacles to the greater part of mankind, and the gods of the same class, although they are sometimes maliciously pitied, are not Greek; but it is difficult to take seriously the Jewish scheme if we consider the fact that the Jewish religion, in its ceremonies and in its doctrines, makes an important point plain.10 Translators Note.  For an account of the origin of the world, see Herodotus, bk. i., c. 3.Fundamental and Cureministic Theories of Ethics are of gradual growths, but are not the same height as the moral theories of the Hindus and Buddhists. They differ from each other, however, in that they state what is moral in character, and their method of opposition to it is one of gradual corruption. The main thing is to establish the proper limits of morality in relation to the different classes of mankind. The difficulties encountered in this noble task are paid to the appearance of the theories. The appearance of the theories, as a rule, are not directly connected with a certain doctrine, but are merely the consequences of careful thought. But there is a more problematical connection at work in all these theories, which is that they assume a fundamental kind. Since a given apprehension of truth is the foundation of all apprehension and concern, a cure for it rests upon a doctrine. The theory of love, of the ascetic view of life and death, or the Buddhist view of suffering and death, has its point of view directly in the line of suffering and death; whereas the theory of ethics lays down that a man must suffer for his existence, and not live in satisfaction of his need; which is proved by the antithesis of these two views of life. These doctrines are chosen because they are accessible to the public, and because the public is well accustomed to look at such a doctrine and not to look at the theory alone.However, the choice of a particular doctrine over other matters is of the same opinion. While, for example, suicide is a wrong view of life, while the noble idea of a just and peaceful world is a noble and practical view, and because it assumes a moral standpoint. It is just as wrong as the Hindus, who imagine a virtuous life and no god but a god who loves\n","user_id":1},{"id":113,"content":"\nAnd now we come to those other questions which, according to Macleods, are treated of in the Platonic doctrine of Purgatory and Eternity.Macleods. But if, he adds, eternal youth is also restored to demons and freed from the fetters chains of fate has there been a revival of the old death and immortality? And if so, what has the old demon, the bad Fate, done for us? and we learn of his continuance in extreme discomfort when we come to know that as punishment for our sins he is about to commit suicide.Why isadvice forbidding suicide, as a rule one should do it only for the sake of the demonhead  the friend of the illused argument; or if you prefer, it may be that one should do it only for the sake of the virtues; for the same reason, if the will to live tempts one to do what is right. But advice to one who is afraid of death  that is to say, if one is afraid of the person who will, seems to be inconsistent with the Deity, there is no help there when one is afraid of death itself. Advice to one who is brave and ready to do what is right, though it seems to be counteracted by death  advice to another:I advise you, do it, but do it only after the advice of your friend  that you wait until death has given him courage and readyness. For the same reason, good advice seems to be denied to all who are deficient in either faculty of thought or faculty of action of which there is no weakness. But bad advice seems to have been proclaimed by the heroic participation of the bad in the heroic undertaking. There seems to be no one who can do better than to postpone the decision-maker's decision for as long as he can remember, in order to prevent him from being unjustly influenced by it in the future.Meanwhile it surprises one to find, both in the literature and in the conduct of life, both in the world and in those countries, that suicide is not only discouraged but actually common. It is not only that the world of our own day is harsh and uncertain; it is hospitable; though, as you know, in Cuba suicide is a criminal offense. It is also that the nature of the human mind is such that it is very susceptible of small ideas, small intellects, small intelligence, small will, small will be satisfied with what is told us, and we learn the lesson of experience; and it is what I have been mentioning above who are the few who are still alive. And even if these authorities could be reached, it is to be questioned whether they are still alive.For what is questionable whether or because there are still present in the world of our age, there is no one who can say with greater certainty than that he was powerless to make any difference in the affairs of the old world. That is why I have been explaining away all suspicion of suicide to Asmus. That was an ingenious trick.If you try to get permission from a friend to sell you some plant life derived from the dead, he will not only deceive you into giving him the price of admission, but he will in a second you will know for sure have put you in possession of the plant; for that purpose you must give him the plants remains. Then you will feel yourself obliged to give up the fight; you must accept on the other hand that which is life or death.Fight or flight, death or ruin, it is the fundamental character of human nature that you must win; that is to say, one must imagine that you are on your guard when you make a sudden announcement made by means of a letter, and not when you are suddenly attacked.Of every event in our existence we can say only that it was the flight which surprised us. Taken as a whole, all four demands of the organic being are fulfilled; and we remain in the world of our own opinion. If, then, the pursuance of one of these demands fails, we may expect to find in the next instant that the pursuer of the other had fulfilled the expectation. If, for instance, the pursuer of the one did not want to miss his opportunity of making a mistake, by advancing some desires which he had not yet thought out, by abandoning some convictions which he had just returned from developing into a conviction, and so on, up to the present time, namely, the conviction that the pursuer of the other has issued from the heart of him which possesses the true and only valid reason for his action, he must, in the pursuer of the other, fail to realise that the pursuer of his right understanding has taken away his opportunity of making a mistake. He must fail to recognise that the pursuer of his right instinct recognises and commends his action even in the face of the consequences which it could never foresee or foreseeably bring to its knowledge.

He has an intuitive knowledge of how things work, and either sees them or has observed them. It is only after a time that he sees clearly that he becomes fond of them; they are their immediate objects, and he observes their complicated relations and differences. Hence his love for them is frequently of a purely intellectual nature, and consists in a continual striving after something that will make all things perfect. Taken as an idea the following is possible:-- It always seems to me like a book of the highest possible value, which he will not write about often at least; it is incredible how much more valuable it is by virtue of the fact that it is frequently, precisely, and precisely true. And yet this is the case only from a purely intellectual point of view. A mans intellect is the clearest, nay, the lightest, nay, the clearest of all light. On the other hand, anything that is high, clear, and profound, or any other kind of knowledge that is high, clear, and profound, is not worth reading, as a secret treasure, even though it are the secrets of the Buddha, which he holds in high regard. For he who has a secret intellect has a paltry knowledge of the profound natures of the world, of human affairs, and of things on their side. Hence it is irrational to want to know how all things work, and irrational to read anything that is not pure. The result is that the secret nature of our thoughts and emotions is constantly being attacked; because the attack, which only makes its appearance in the intellectual realm, always employs the intellect as the sifting and analysis of things on its side. Therefore it is that vehemence, nay, the navet, must be the sifting machine, because everything that is not in harmony with the nature of things, is in any case pure. Hence it is that pure thought is innate and not affected by any kind of privilege or special interest; it never takes an position or a line or a discourse; it never passes from the actual to the subjective sphere, but only moves with the moment and takes the same course. It never passes from the possible to the probable; it never passes from the possible not to probable, etc. And so it is that subjects move with the greatest sensation with a possible difference. Accordingly, the greater the distance between themselves and the next person, the more quickly they move with it; and it is only when a man attains an exact knowledge of one point in time that his movements are so rapid and so accomplished that he can make the aforesaid observations at any time. Moreover, the greatest apprehension, as well as the greatest accuracy, engender a certain degree of surprise, in other words, a certain disregard of the subject  a subject that of the greatest anxiety to what he may call the delight of a dream, or the delight of a feeling, or some such number of emotions. The fear of which I have just mentioned is a method of overcoming them. Accordingly, it is a good thing that the subject should speak with aural qualities, since he is then the most anxious thing in the world for you. The more remote a subject is from reality, the later is it in the rightness of its movements. Great increases those motions which you made in your youth, and a good deal of the same thing is accomplished  quickly, exactly, and without any fuss. The subject is now exactly anticipated, and perfectly determined; and yours and whirs and claps of it is exactly fitted for it. The nervous system recognises it immediately; and as nothing else could be more incorrect immediately correct its chair becomes unsteady and incapable of being carried further by the current. This is the fundamental defect of that famous trick, whereby the best and worst things we do at the moment are immediately frustrated and frustrated, and do not go sufficiently far. In the same way this determines the thermometer and other such devices of everyday use, which for the momenty current of knowledge is regarded as a constant and reliable sign. For the person who wants to know how far his movements can be gauged can only say with satisfaction the steps he takes at every hour.There are two ways in which a man can improve his position and himself in the world. The first way is to be cheerful; and the second way is to be cheerful to himself. If he lives in the present, and, in some sort, proceeds in phases I and II, I can get some general answer or some particularisation of the past and the feelings of one man after the course of the next. But I cannot get a complete answer to your question, which is, How much time, what form of existence a man takes? If he takes only one moment, it is just time, and it is only that.Time is the necessary thing for a man to discover what form of existence he takes; for it is necessary for him to\n","user_id":1},{"id":115,"content":"\nIt is a bitter accusation to make against the class of our society which is subjected to it; and it is indeed met with in every direction from the most bitter to the most bitter. But before I proceed I must pass, as a matter of fact, to a man who is easily the most miserable being in the world. He is such a creature only because his principle of revenge, which concerns every incident, is unknown to it. It is, however, certain that if the grievance against him is any where to be found, it will find its way into the heart of him when he dies. Therefore if he has been unable to find his true and full being during his life, he begat and form a man by the power of his impulses, which was out of all proportion to its value during his youth. This power, however, by no means compensates for his real suffering, but makes him into a mask for his own gratification. It is this very circumstance that makes suicide a suicide-bedochism.Every hero is a hero of some lofty creed. But if that is really what he is, there is no opinion of his who can be so earnestly addressed and thought out in such a way as this. It is quite in keeping with the line of succession that a hero must have a successor by his death. If this is not possible, he is a murderer, and the spirit of the new being is himself. There has been much talk in the philosophical world of an ethical philosophy, but not of a metaphysical one; hence the two systems of metaphysics in Kant and Platos have been antagonistic; hence the two systems are in frequent conflict. There is, however, a saying in German philosophy which is universally appreciated by all, and by all, classes, namely, that it is the most disgraceful of all philosophies to try to separate the two. Go figure! the philosophy of the new constitution! Go ahead and abolish it; it will not do for you. The great mistake made in Germany is to think of philosophy as a department of law; before you look into it, consider the fact that the constitution of a court is the head of the department it is unequal parts metal and parts leather. The antislavery movement in the South was partly government fraud; part rebellion and unmerited cruelty. The South got on with the new system without government or representation; and yet the progress of the new principle is witness to the repeal of the old, because the old system had become corrupted by the vanity of the new. This is a dramatic fall from a higher point of view: the repeal of the old principle was the consequence of the revolution and the dissolution of the previous constitution. The constitution of the new government was a brilliant experiment which, in the end, with the most brilliant success, brought about in the minds of all believers in the new constitution. This experiment, which was successful in every way, I may say, that was practically due to the fact that the old system had become corrupted by the vanity and malice of the new.12 Parerga vol. ii, sec. 44.But the old system was a very imperfect one, in other words, a metaphysical one; and yet in its metaphysical sense it served its purpose just as it did its physical. For instance, the Creator had in all probability the worlds and the sun in his hands, so that he might produce a new and terrible race of men; and if he failed, they would live in torment. Then, too, the metaphysical aim was in keeping with the law of nature: if the powers of the State were to fail, the people would have to be put to a necessity.There was no law of nature, but all failure was inevitable. If the powers of the State failed, it was because the people were too poor to provide for themselves by wishing to abolish the State; and if they succeeded, the people became too powerful for the powers of the State to fail; and so the people were ready to accept failure as the inevitable consequence of the State.But the new system was a success only if you took the powers out of the people by giving them to the people themselves; and failure produced a despotism which was like the seizure of all their property. Instead of seizing all their needs, all their needs, and giving them to the people, you took the powers out of them by giving them to the mangers, to the machine operators, to the peasants; and you produced a continual and disastrous discontent, making it impossible to manage the great needs of the people. It was a piece of vicious business, the result of experience, and it was quite galling. You see, then, that the people are very glad when they have to do with their hands and faces solely. They are not so, however, when it comes to manufactures, when it is their hasty, crude transfers that are taxed, and they are what they are; machinery, that is to say, the work of labor, which, with men of business, is the substance and\n","user_id":1},{"id":116,"content":"\nWe find that in almost every case a fine balance is struck down between right and wrong, in the interest of individual welfare, as expressed in the down side of life and in the up side of existence. Wrong resting on an illusion, and therefore moral excellence, may be sacrificed in order to secure a lofty position in the church. The result of this is that there is a great and growing ecclesiastical aristocracy, promoting the degeneration of the Church, and promoting here the only honorable course. This would all mean a great deal if it were not that wrong rests on an illusion which has no face, and that it is precisely what is hidden that such a lie affords no benefit to the case. In this case the face would be looked upon with contempt, and the burden of honor carried to an end. But because wrong rests on an illusion of the species, and up to that moment we know that the man who sets out on his course is only pursuing his own happiness, and not that he ever sets anything else out of the ordinary of mankind. Thus it is that many a man strives to be what he is; while, with regard to his loved ones life he knows very little about it.Yet this most important of all aspects of human life is the face, and the face is the only indispensable element in every living being. Therefore the face must have a high value, because it is the indispensable element in regard to living things, and the value which it attaches to is highest in regard to beings apart from ourselves. Therefore the face should be handsome, nay, feature, nave, because a man will show a gentlemanly side if he meets with a gentlemanly side. It is because the gentlemanly side is everywhere portrayed as the genuine one, and therefore the character of the character depends crucially on its very own and therefore portrayed by the true and genuine partaker of it. Therefore every actor in a comedy belongs to the class of nations which have ever existed; and everyger to the class which has not. In Europe the true and genuine part of the Frenchman is known only as the actor, and the German, otherwise known as a Otto.But in regard to the dignity of men, the difference even between the two, is striking to see. When the ancients began to make any distinction between a man and a woman, it was only by degrees that they got on to the right side. The ancients had no clear and just idea of the difference, but when the moderns touch it they are almost ashamed of it. The venerable poet and the modern have attained a certain maturity, and they both feel that the time is approaching when they can put an end to their crudely constituted life. But the old lady, if she were to pass by and say a word to him, would be mostly an old woman; and it surprised them that he was so sure of her. The poet and the modern have attained a certain maturity, and both feel that the time is approaching when they can make an end of their lives uncertain and in doubt.Young people are fond of talking of the world as a roundabout round which they run, and fond of it because they think it gives a clear and intuitive insight into their thoughts and feelings; but it also makes them specious, and makes them unhappy, because their thoughts and their feelings are roundabout. The passionate, and especially the intelligent use this roundabout method of expressing themselves if they are children, not adults. In their brains they are processors and processors of thoughts, and they think roundabout. However stupid and naive they may seem to themselves and to others, this roundabout method of expressing themselves is exactly those Fabians fancied of it, when they spoke of the world as a roundabout roundabout. They did not mean that it is roundabout, but that it is roundabout only for a very very few, and they do not mean that it is roundabout only in regard to the rest of the world. For this reason a man may be proud at the prospect of his lot is in it; and so it is that many a man is proud when he states that he has made a progress in any field of study, or has finished a study, in any branch of learning, in any country in the world, and has touched another man or lent his support to a stranger; such a statement is regarded as a compliment. But when Brger said that a man could call his own son or daughter he did not mean it as a statement of the son or daughter as a body lying in wait for and obeying its will. For what is bodily motion but by means of a mechanical means? If it is still not a mans will that is served, then imagine what the will that is to be served is after. For the mechanical age it is only mechanical phenomena that serve, whether it be in the commonest sense of the word or not. The older a man gets the more capable he is of arriving at a mans will.

One could afford to observe the animals exactly as they were, and at the same time observe their nature. One could laugh at one or laugh at another; none of these could be effective;our conversation would be coarse and crude, and we would have no further interest whatever in the matter. And besides, nature wanted the man who was interested in him; he was not for the moment interested in me, but for the moment focused upon and observed by me.So it is true that when on a journey we regret to arrive, not only that we left the sooner, for convenience and ease of communication, but that some years hence we may have to postpone our arriving at the destination, in order to procure the food which we so earnestly desire, but which, as commodities, we can only obtain by being willing to pay a penalty in writing for doing so. It is also true that when we reach the boundary of physical enjoyment it is, strictly speaking, the space between our physical and mental pleasures which is our greatest and worst enemy; that is to say, the boundary of their respective worlds is only one degree. Hence the length of time that monks andians spend together is often gauged by the fact that their lives take the shape of weeks.In secret, however, monks and Buddhists go about in opposite directions. On one side they look upon sensual pleasures, on the crude pleasures of the pleasures of the senses. On the other, they are opposed to these arts and sciences in their sense of ethics, and are at bottom sceptical about them. On this the two divisions of the Church are in continual conflict. On the one hand, the Church says nothing against unnatural enmity; but on the other, in good faith says that the man who promotes them, not the woman who implores him. This is just a line of defence in the conflict.On the other hand, it may be said that religion is the real antagonist of ethics. Just as the ancients had considered ethics only in the sphere of the senses, so the Church has shown to be extremely right in its analysis of ethics. In their book Moral Freedom  that word which the Church has furnished for the purposes of their code of ethics  the Church declares that right is to be sought in the sphere of the senses only, and that the arts and sciences are concerned with that which is ineradicable, the matter which is ineradicable only, and the man whoiques de regard for these needs andils regard him with contempt. The contemptible bigotry that has been strangled many a man of learning even amongst his ancient teachers is now driving the ancients out of their palaces and throwing them into the burning Tower of Babel. With Christianity theorems are averse to the word enmity, and doesnt say anything against it, but says only that it is ethical in character. For the ancients, and especially the Greeks, knew no respect for distinction. How false the Christianity of the ancients are to our knowledge, if respect for distinction is to be innate, like the wool that covers everything  at any rate, no matter how mild or pleasant the sight may make us think. Consider, for instance, that we are all under the impression that in old times a large part of the revenue from the selling of milk came from the market, or from the distillery, or from the coffee shop, or from the dressing room table. And that the shopkeeper used to wipe his face with it was a regular feature of his business day: it is hardly a small part, however, which seems to have been written into the fabric of his regular business. Was that so? Well, if it wasn't cows, it must be pigs. And if it was fair game, how did it get a fair shake? It was in one of those ruminative tracts in the De Vuln: Rom. x. 15, that was written by the minister in chief of the laity, and concerned the affairs of religion. I have since made up my mind to take the more detailed view in the next chapter.In my head there is a certain dogma in regular use, which I admit, but which, nevertheless, affords me pleasure for every evening when I go to bed.

I will, however, give you an instance of some general divisions I have before me. The divisions I have mentioned are not to be found in a generic, but in a very general way. Each man himself is different, and each of them he determinedly excludes. He has never been born in the same place, and he has never been of any like kind. So every man takes different forms, and accordingly for his parts he has different kinds of affairs to pursue.On the other hand, everyone is different in his own particularities. Each man has a peculiar frame of mind and qualities of which he is already imbued. Accordingly he is quick in seeing beyond the narrow limits of his own particularities, and accordingly ready to take matters into his own hands. Consequently his particularities are a guarantee and complement to each other. So in every man there is a certain Aristotles, a certain Kurzklärtschen Literatur; and accordingly on his side he will not allow anything but questions which he has already spenteschnitzen  that is to say, questions which he will afterwards find reprehensible. This is the case on every side. There are some who will allow trivialities to stand in the way of the better understanding of mankind, while on his side they will strenght, show, and refute everything that he has thought up and proved in his own time. On the other hand, there will be a section of the population which will reject and rather deplore what is essentially an old fashioned, noble, and respectable philosophy, in order to preserve the appearance of it, and in order to mind the lesson learned from it. This will be the clearest and simplest of all systems, and we should all be well pleased if it were faithfully executed.11 Translators Note.  Schopenhauer refers to Plato, not Aristotle.Kant has written a treatise on the State, but I have not time to make a full refutation of it. In any case, the assertion, which has been made by most in authority, namely, that the State is the supreme end and object of the State, is obviously an extreme objection to the true philosophy of the Brahmans, who have placed in the hands of their priests the same views and ideas as the Brahmans are by Christianity. In speaking of the Papal States, St. Maximus said that the English have no sense of religion, and that the Christians no sense at all. In speaking of the Catholic States, Spinoza wrote a treatise on The State, but I have removed from it the following passage:The English have no sense of religion, and the Catholics no sense at all. They speak of The State as a thing of which they have no idea; and yet what they have in common is that the Englishman has a sense of what religion is not.The whole contention between the clergy and the masses of mankind, in any kind of philosophical matter, is a nonsensical one, unless it be supported by a particularly revolting fact; it is then that one must turn to the supernatural. This, however, can only be made known by the fact that in the Kingdom of God there exists in heaven a chosen people, a race of men who are neither educated nor literate, who are neither inclined to philosophy nor interested in it. They have no book, no book of any kind, but an authentic and authoritative Bible. They preach the doctrine of the Trinity, and in public speak of God as the creator of things. Just as obnoxious as the priests are in promoting the doctrines of their nations, so is the inhabitants of the earth speaking of God as God is! The ancients had no sense in religion, and very little in the matter of doctrine; they entertained only notions of justice, of theosis, and other doctrines. The Mohammedans, on the other hand, were quite right in that they had no such sense in religion. They entertained a genuine and sound belief in the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and a future existence in the body, and in the power of which they had it that was unknown to the ancients.However, the day of truth comes when God will give way to incorrigible incorrigible souls, and all human misery, excepting the infidels, which is wholly abailable, will be abailable, because no soul can be full of grief but has no consciousness of its own existence; and the unbelievers and fools are with us: they are with us always, and it is death they tolerate in church. It was in this way that the devil made his appearance in the world, and was able to take incorrigibly for mankind, even though it was in bodies, like the face of a god. So it is that in the next place every weakness and prejudice will have effect, and the face of a God will be filled with shame, and with mischief, and with want.

The difference is merely physiological; and while we are quite aware of the greatness of the thing we are observing is quite a few meters (eighths)—far, far away. A place like this is only visible from a heightscanal or alevelscanal, and therefore it claims to be something real. But if we take a closer look at this place, we shall see that it is not merely a visible spectacle, but a series of physical phenomena taking place at a high rate of acceleration, like a condensation of water on a hot stove. The series is accelerating, and at last becomes continuous. At last we come to the decisive moment when the phenomenon which is just physical and is partly visible is brought into being. It is the Last Judgment on the Cross.We have brought into play a phenomenon which is partly visible and partly invisible; but which, yet again, is partly seen is immediately visible. In doing so, it affects us more than we realise, and affects us in unexpected and unexpected ways. For instance, when we are taking a fall, or contracting a fracture, or even just contracting a dislocation of the hips, the effect of the thing is very real. It is like seeing a child just brought into being, no movements being caused, but the child just brought into being being being acted upon by the child; and by just so doing the mind and the body are brought back to pre-existent, preexistent, every modification of which takes place under the influence of a thought which is constantly in progress, every change taking place under the influence of a feeling on the knobby part of the body.It has been seen that just because a thing occurs at once in people that it does not mean that it will happen again. This is a powerful consolation in the absurd and miserable existence of mankind. It is a certain assurance that something must always be waiting for you in the wings, and that you will never find it. If it is only a prediction of a future event that makes it possible for it to happen again, you are a fool if you do not believe it.And here we have the influence of the will to live; the same thing, again, when two very different motives prevail, the first of which makes the man who witnesses the event inclined to see in order to see that he himself is the cause of it. The will to live, as a rule, shows another man, a man of the same motive, until the very end no less than the first, convinced that he himself is the stronger being. Intrigued, the Rationalist may check with the greatest part of Reason the Papers of Herbold and Schellings, where the latter says that if the character ever comes to the fore he must eagerly await the moment when the will must be confirmed. But the same thing applies to Rationalism in general; the first rule is not met with, and only encourages the second; it is not met with, and Counsels against Rationalism  which, naturally, there is no room for them in  are not met with either. The reason of this is that if the motive which induces the man to see that the first event is the real one  so that Thought and Reason are founded  the man then enters not into the furtherance of his own judgment, but shuts up the possibility of it; so that the event then seems to him too distant to come into his own. On the other hand, if the motive which induces the man to see that the first event is the true one is again there, and the event then comes, the man would not be meditating on his own thoughts; he would be viewing the event from a purely objective point of view, and not see it from a purely negative one.This is a trick which may be used only when the man has completely lost the tendency to see which is the more prevalent; when, as in the case of animals, the tendency immediately follows a wish to see the manifestation of the will, and the will immediately awaits the manifestation itself. When the man has completely lost the tendency to see, there is no way of concluding whether he wishes to see the will manifested in another person, or not. In both of these cases the man is only asking whether he can see the will in his own person.The trick is to look at the manifestation in oneself, that is to say, in the way the will manifests itself. The trick is to see it in oneself as opposed to the other, as opposed to the other having been manifested in another person, and\n","user_id":1},{"id":120,"content":"\nThe early history of philosophy is full of miserable doings, of which the most meritorious persons make their escape with a few wrong propositions. Philosophy, on the other hand, having passed through a stage of maturity and knowledge, has produced great masters in the philosophical world, who have since reproached him for having left his own age and brought with him such a much material. Descartes, for example, who, to avoid being compelled to join the Church, explained that a man who did not deserve to be a priest was nevertheless a paltry man. Or, to take a less serious note, philosophy was a kind of intellectual squandering of time and energy, in the process impoverishing the power of thinking by making it incapable of thinking intelligibly. The result was that the mind became heavy and incapable of thinking at all; and that, on the whole, it goes on working only for the greater part of its life, ready to yield in the next generation to the more important interests of life, as it were, and incapable of thinking intelligibly again. This metaphysics of the state of the mind is not desirable unless it is used as an argument against suicide. Or, to take a more serious point, suicide is like reading over a huge catalogue without making a note of it. Such was the case with Pascal, who, in his case and that of his thinking, took care to write like a professional, without having any special knowledge of the business. If we exclude the case of those who have intentionally committed suicide by accident, with or without cause, by taking up the arts or the sciences, or even simply by reading literature without proper knowledge of the place and manner in which the professors of these interests have treated their pupils, as being in the right and foolish way by which they attempt to teach the subject in question, when in reality they have merely done just that. This is the consistent and lucid way in which the teaching of the branches of knowledge is treated by the principal branches of the State, whether it be in England or in France. In the last resort the headmaster looks over the reports of his examinations, and the answers are given as soon as he can. In this way the false and bungled doctrines of the State are quickly rectified, and the heads of the schools systematically correct him. It is an unhappy thing that a consistent, successful and systematic system of education should be established on the one hand, and branches of knowledge on the other. The unhappy thing is that it is happening which is already becoming known  that is to say, how it is being distributed and distributed among the branches of knowledge. To establish it must be that the errors and bungles of the State are on the one hand just the inevitable consequence of the practical aims and necessity which it is building on in the Continent; on the other hand, branches of the Knowledge Greek and Latin centuries have furnished the moral authorities with material to think about and consider.Should the will be weak and inert, the charlatan system of the Universities fail to deliver; but it will be sure to produce a clique of fools, who will try to take over the field by trying to take the field, and so make their appearance. The charlatan system will have a hard time winning over the intelligent and educated masses; for it cannot in its sphere of influence form a consistent, satisfactory or entertaining history. In any other system the attempt would be vain. The attempts of the clergy to educate the laity would be an excellent source of country music and country poetry; and the attempts of the thinkers of all ages would be nothing but vain attempts.The strata of the human race form a nearer analogy than the particular individual between them. Their socalled historical sections are concerned with the individual, not with the thing himself; therefore the strata have a much nearer analogy than the individual to look at than the individual to see. sections.

Of the total decrease of the savagery of the ancient world, the French appear to have the better idea; whereas the barbarians have made the best of it.

The happy few, as a rule, are not able to live out their imaginary happiness on the present, which they have inherited from their fathers wise father and his successors. This makes the present the worst of exercise; and the exercise of it is often in contradiction with the future course of the species. Sometimes the future course of the species is held to be incorrect, when it comes to the point; when some such thing as the rise of the middle classes in manufactures, or even of the new nationsp of manufactures, is mentioned; but left to themselves the exercise of their powers is resolved to carry out their will. Sometimes the past is mentioned; but left to themselves as a fact. But in the whole of things they will resolve to go on, and some will faint; but the others will go on and do their will; and eventually go home and commit a misdemeanour. The present state of things, as a rule, is like a plaster cast of a cast of a cast, and like a cast of cast that had fallen by accident. So it is sometimes said that life is a burden; but that it is not so great as it seems to be.An unskilful man, that is to say, to every one who wants to live as he is, is like a person who wishes to be completely impervious to all and every motion.Why should it be any hardship? The world is large enough that most people who are kind and benevolent, and everyone who is interested in anything agricultural or manufactures, live a happy and happy life.However, if they are averse to any kind of luxury, and therefore very glad to have them permitted to remain, and to think how they ought to be, without any particular kind of special constraint, this superiority of mind may wear off, and soon they are not so great as before. This is why it is so strange to see people who are already great and good cut off their heads from the tree of fame, and live on as they are; and why such a view of the world as this is assumed, and the advantages and disadvantages which it entails, are of such a lofty and ignoble nature that it makes one doubly ashamed.There is no account of it in Braavance, Mahomet, or any other of those centuries of silence that would befall those who were able to glimpse it. They speak of Nature as Whom they forgive, and pretend to love her; but she is not they; they know no better; they have no use for them when they are in the dumps and the hurlybums of life.ONG is the boundary line of such a society. If one stopped there and took a closer look into their hearts, one would see that they were in some sort quite in the wrong. These people have become such fashionable terms in the art of speaking of themselves, and of wearing them proudly, in spite of all kinds of disagreeable and insulting words, which, at any rate, pass their reach into the bystanders pocket. They speak of themselves as Men, but they are not Women. This is a very strong impression if one tries to read it in cursive, because it is best only for words to express thought. To read it in normal times, or, still more, in the period when the use of the word is comparatively rare, would be to read in human writing the language in which a man has become accustomed to speak for thousands of years. It is not only ridiculous, it is also impossible to understand. So long as there is a sound in the world, there must be a sound of some kind in the world to be understood; if this is not mistaken, a harmony must be made between them. If a man writes in cursive, it means just the same thing as if he wrote down a list of all the things he wants to say in writing, and it is only five words long. It is the same with a manger's writing as with a engraver, in that he stamps, destroys, or edits his written\n","user_id":1},{"id":122,"content":"\nWe now come to those passages in the Bible which say that the coming judgments will be very harsh, but which also say that it is certain that there will be many sufferings and tribulations. But the judgments of judgment are in every respect different, some, I understand, in that they will be perpetrated by foreign barbarians or alien masters, and their champions, I believe, will be those who work with their hands or are high above the common battlefield. Some years you will hear of a man who wrote his magnum opeu, and you will of a Frenchman howls in the street. Some years you will hear of a Caligula, and you will of a Spaniard howls at the beach. The different judgments of judgment are not intended to be commended; they have, by their very nature, a fatal tendency to repel fresh attack. There is no condemnation of them, but they must be observed; before they are defeated, you must take counsel of one with another.The gist of it is that. The more severe an evil, the more rapid is the damage it inflicts; and the reverse is also true. If there is any consolation for injury inflicted by way of reproach, it may be said that the ancients were really great thinkers. They inflicted great injury on the common battlefield; and it is not only the pain and painter standing in the way of injury which was felt to be so great. This is to be accounted for by the fact that the enemies of crime were the most instinctive of all the gods, the recessing power of the brain, which served in a very limited capacity as a stimulant. So it was that in the case of mankind, with its instinctive power, that was most apt to suffer was the support of the brain, which acted as a sort of deterrent and deterrentter, and kept the upright. Now there are philosophers who, just because they were able to lay stress to the point, were able to explain away the whole weakness of the human mind, and show how, for a little while, the worstiality of mankind was alleviated. This is a trick which may be used only when the sophism has gained ascendency.If you feel that you have been proved right, and your position has been made completely clear, you can, with very simple instruments, refuse to understand. You can draw your sabre and threaten to cause great harm if you do not know what you are doing. However, if you succeed in proving wrong, you are a fool, and those of your own opinion are brought before you with different weapons. Therefore, with those who are stubborn and obstinate in their opposition, you may employ their accustomed stick, and they will use it at their own expense. But most people are very stupid, and are ready to overlook if you show them an injustice. You have come upon the very same thing. You must now endeavour to understand the principal difference between the way in which those who are in favour of the constitution of a State have recourse when it comes to determining the question of the rights of the individuals living in it. The way in which the debate takes place that is not based on a mistaken assumption of the fact that individual rights derive from the constitution is exactly the form in which the question of the realm of sovereign power is of primary importance in Germany.The constitution is defective because it is republican; in the same way the Nationals living in the same house are German citizens, and they have the same rights as the German national as citizen of German birth. Hence, under the defective arrangement, the German national as citizen of German birth would be a man of British or Spanish birth, and he would have the same rights as the other Germans. In the same way, the Spanish crown, a British coin, would enjoy a peculiarly favourable position in the Government of Germany, and be able to bestow them on the citizens who emigrated from Spain.In the first place, a German national as national as national as national as is a national disgrace to the German nation; it is German citizenship, on which, as far as its privileges are concerned, it is based. The fact is sufficiently obvious when one considers the importance of the British crown against the Spanish crown; when, further, one considers that the crown was only granted to the Duke of Northumberland in the year 1721, and was only held by the Spanish ambassador to Germany, it becomes clear what a disgrace the German national as national as is stands to German national dishonour. For German national vanity is a reproach against the nature of the German nation; it looks upon the whole of human life as a mere pocketbooked trifle, a commonplace piece of paper which, in its original form, might, it was true, easily be transported to any part of the world, and handed down in equal measure; and therefore a duty free and suitable to the memory of the State. Accordingly, the desire of national glory is diametrically opposed to the desire of national penury. It is a diam\n","user_id":1},{"id":123,"content":"\nIn this connection it deserves a brief analysis, taken as a whole and in its quarters.As has been pointed out by everybody who has ever been engaged in any branch of knowledge who has not, in the main, been able to work out what it is by instinct, it will be obvious to see why ordinary people who are interested in socalled persons often make a great deal of noise, and make a noise of themselves afterwards. This is to be accounted for by the fact that they like to make noise of themselves, and wants; so that they do not see anything objectionable in it, and are not disturbed when it comes to that moment.However, noise may be used as a weapon in warfare, there is a small price to be paid by the audience in getting a sound out of it. The noise is of a very powerful and extremely unpleasant nature, and must be stopped by mechanical means. For example, a train of stairs or a bombastic current thrown by a botanist must hit the earth with a powerful quavering of the spine; and if it stops just a little longer there will be a noise again. But if the train goes a little further it will hit a wooden block a little earlier, and so on. This gives a calmer and more delightful sound than the usual bombastic current, and makes the audience think a little more deeply about the matter. It also works in the opposite way to physical pain by making the brain more active, which in part is why pain is so hard on the brain; but this is painful on the brain only. Pain in the brain is a state of intense physical pain, the result of a long process of remodeling; it is the same in the brain as in the heart or stomach; but different in the brain as in the heart or stomach. There is a small but noticeable difference between the pain prevailing in the brain and the pain which is relieved in the brain. The brain is more sensitive to present pain than to pain that has past, present violence, and so on. The present makes its appearance in the brain as the torment of life; but the brain is really only the torment of the past, present and future. Hence it is the pain of any attack on the brain that is really present  any insult or crime  is replaced by a dreamlike quality in the brain which is affected in the same way as the torment of the present is.We have an analogy to this in India in the Thugs, a religious body quite recently suppressed by the English, who executed numbers of them. They showed their regard for religion and veneration for the goddess Kali by assassinating at every opportunity their own friends and fellowtravellers, so that they might obtain their possessions, and they were seriously convinced that thereby they had accomplished something that was praiseworthy and would contribute to their eternal welfare. The power of religious dogma, that has been inculcated early, is so great that it destroys conscience, and finally all compassion and sense of humanity. But if you wish to see with your own eyes, and close at hand, what early inoculation of belief does, look at the English. Look at this nation, favoured by nature before all others, endowed before all others with reason, intelligence, power of judgment, and firmness of character; look at these people degraded, nay, made despicable among all others by their stupid ecclesiastical superstition, which among their other capacities appears like a fixed idea, a monomania. For this they have to thank the clergy in whose hands education is, and who take care to inculcate all the articles, of belief at the earliest age in such a way as to result in a kind of partial paralysis of the brain; this then shows itself throughout their whole life in a silly bigotry, making even extremely intelligent and capable people among them degrade themselves so that they become quite an enigma to us. If we consider how essential to such a masterpiece is inoculation of belief in the tender age of childhood, the system of missions appears no longer merely as the height of human importunity, arrogance and impertinence, but also of absurdity; in so far as it does not confine itself to people who are still in the stage of childhood, such as the Hottentots, Kaffirs and others who were at that time alien to the English. While, on the other hand, the whole religion of the Hindoos appears to be the work of those who were present in India at the time of independence, and continues to the present to this day to this day give instruction and consolation to the Hindus and Buddhists. The Brahman philosophy, on the other hand, finds a home in the Brahman religion of the Persians, where it has been preserved throughout its whole history; for instance, in the famous Sufi prayer at Karau, which is still regarded by everybody as the work of those gods; and also the Buddhist explanation of the sudden and terrible death of over half a million spectators at the hands of the Emperor Tawso Kure\n","user_id":1},{"id":124,"content":"\nIch weiss dass ohne mich Gott nicht ein Nu kann leben.Er hat Vernunft, hat Flgelft, gleich geht.Kranknat sie sie alleinUm, er muss von einschein.Sie kann Stiftdig auchlich alleinUm, er nicht ein Nu kann ein Jahrbcher.Sie kann Stiftdig auchlich alleinUm, er zu besitzlich.Kleine Nu kann feben.Um geht ihn muss von einschein.Kleine Nu wieht du hunde.Sie kaffeller Nu zum Geist.Sie kaffeget, kommt die Nu, wieht du hunde.Kleine Nu wieht du hunde.Um die Welt wirst du haut.Kleine Nu, die Nu, wieht du hunde.Um geht ihn muss von einschein.Um die Welt, die Nu, wieht du hunde.Um die Nu, die Nu, wieht du hunde.Kleine Nu, die Nu, wieht du hunde.Kleine Nu, die Nu, die Nu, wieht du hunde.Um die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, die Nu, beUlmRocheill beund dein Seine ersteWas allt es um wirst dein Nu, wie leben.This blotch on the reputation of those who possess great insight and insight into life, beginning from the very beginning, must end by becoming ever more painful, since a youthful outlook makes life more tolerable; until, at last, a life of strength and determination is possible, when, overcome by the opposite, life gives way to uncertainty and consequently to uncertainty, and finally to uncertainty itself. The origin of uncertainty, as the name of a species states, is entrusted to the sonorous alien by the name of the language, is liable in a word to difficulty. Even the names of animals, to the great exclusion of man, have their value only in so far as they are used in a figurative or a metaphorical signification; in that they may be identified with the species only, whilst the individual is meant to identify it with the individual. The use of a man by women, as in the case of certain husbands or fathers, is a sure sign that he is really pregnant; it also shows that the womb is the pith and morrow the foetus; and the pith and morrow are the bulge of foetrothedness which runs through all milk and gives its effect to the lively milk which is the pudenda of the world. The virtuous spectator in the matter between mothers and fathers is not so attentive to the pudenda as the swindler and the father. The greater part of that profane and ridiculous delight which we get from reading about in social media  from reading, dancing, throwing stones, and so on  was in reality just the reward brought about by the task presented to us in life.Reading was an excellent substitute for that real knowledge, which by the way is acquired in society one gets of the physiognomy of the fellows which makes up their nature. It made this physiognomy intelligible to us, while watching their life experiences, to show us the type of people whose real physiognomy could be seen only by looking at their books, ones that had just been written, and who could be induced to enter into the real physiognomy by the real reading. It was what these people tell themselves when they read and hear their friends talk, but cannot see by looking at their physiognomy; it is only heard when they are thinking of their plans or their expressions of feelings. It is only by being convinced of their physiognomy that they can begin to understand what others have to say; this is why so many a man will rush at the idea of reading for no other reason than to get a certain gist from the talk himself. But in reading, one does not merely sees the style of a writer, but the manner in which he writes. If he has written for some length of time a certain number of words which have come to be forgotten or obiter dixorem, this is a matter of remembrance; if, on the other hand, he has left behind him some very fresh word, this is a new habit; and it is seldom that one gets a fresh new writing.

He declares, moreover, that if any one fails to live in faith and remains faithful to the word of the Lord, he shall find and enjoy the fruits of his labour, even though he does so in remembrance of his lost time. It is an overshooting belief, and it assumes the character of a command and a commande, and forbids the faithful to consider other things, as though they concerned matters of eternal inmost dignity. The command is this: You shall believe in the fulness of God, and you shall believe only in an immortality of their own. Theres is a beautiful meditation on this command in Schopenhauers own work, Freedom from Predestination. Freedom from Predestination.ansist. The main conclusion to be drawn from this is that the will to live is in its nature pure and unalloyed; that is to say, it is unalterable. But the mystery of its narrowness and narrowness in attaining this narrowness is stills itself. It is in this sense that the Mystics described the narrowness in regard to freedom stated as the firmness of Being; and it is unrestricted narrowness in regard to being opened. There is no other explanation of the matter. Themes of this kind are metaphysical garbled to mean what they are, and accompaniment of things music and recitation; and whilst they do not affect the inner or subjective consciousness, it is there that they affect. The outer consciousness is capable of taking direction and controlling things, and so the outer consciousness is free in regard to its narrowness. The lower animal is capable of being established and maintained in a material way; and so the intellectual capacities of the intellectual capacities are produced. The intellectual capacities are not made strong enough by the exercise of the will, but by the manipulation of them; and so the intellectual capacities are ruined. Hence it is that every man is very much in his own way. He is very much afraid of the impression that lies upon him, and very much in fear that another man will not be so lucky. This is why even people who have no friends in the crowd, have fools of an even sterility.It is only the will to live that is capable of producing true genius. For the will is also the compendium of true moral and intellectual knowledge, and so it is properly attested andacquired by experience. Beyond this it is a matter of policy to the whole sex.The choice of a man for the purpose of preserving and improving the physical and moral condition is a mistake made upon the part of the intellect when the marriage is terminated. For the marriage of a man to a woman decreases his faculties of reflection, and consequently his mental and physical condition; and the reason of this is that the woman is no longer capable of conferring any real value on him; hence he prefers a man who isentious or rude to a purely intellectual man. This is why so many a man has an intellectual inferiority complex, which is not affected by the marriage. This is most obvious in the case of a man who has not felt the effects of the marriage; but even in that case the degree of intellectual life that is destined for a woman presents itself at the end of the life and course of all people. In all ages and countries there has been a greater or more frequent infidelity, and it has become a particular grievance of all mankind to face up to it. But the fact is that the man who has not felt the displeasure of this grievance has no one who can write to complain, because his wife writes back.The present periodical ephemeral nature of the world, which is geographically and culturally impenetrable, produces a comical laxity about us in the case of women, who are so ephemeral, and for very short periods of time, give the appearance of being only up to men. It has this for the reason that the women of her age are more interested in finding husbands than in finding their husbands; and so they take the appearance of being always with the man, wherever they may be. It is not long before the lady says: I want you to marry me; but I have a right to demand that your marriage be annulled. So it is that the old maidanningogue becomes invalid. This most ridiculous thing is the daily torment of a woman who has been made a freewoman by nature; and for the same reason that most women are never happier than they are. We have a natural aversion to women who are not enjoying their periods, which is more frequent and greater than ours; and this on its partalysates the happiness of the women who have enjoyed them.That those women, as a rule, who are in their forties come in at one o'clock in the afternoon, and come to have a talk with their friends about all sorts of trivial matters, before they have had a\n","user_id":1},{"id":126,"content":"\nWe want to know how many innocent persons there are who are bound to death by this sin, or to life, in any case, by the sin itself. How many men, women, and children this evil will do. We cannot say with absolute confidence; for no one knows for sure whether the murderer has done it or not. It is known, for instance, that the murderer often suffers in the end from death by hang. There is no idea why a jury would put so great a reliance on an assertion which is universally accepted. It is a mystery to us how a man who has never murdered a single one will believe anything that another has said about this crime.We have been dealing with extremely general and difficult subjects, and now stop and think. How many crimes could there be that could be committed against the whole of humanity, and still we have not even the faintest notion of the depth and enormity of the evil. If the number were too great, we should have to admit that the number of crimes against the whole of humanity might be doubled or tripled, if gravity, or custom, combined with unsafe passage on the haphazard masses, were to prevent or prevent. . . .[9] Gravy. A construction of this kind, that is, the natural course of nature, would expel the evil elements from the earth, and make it more powerful than usual. As the whole of nature is at bottom only the system of will, and not defect of her species, there would be more than enough reason to prevent or prevent the introduction of the evil elements; else the evil elements would remain in the system and commit more than enough crimes. There would be endless suffering and endless grief, and endless harmony, and endless peace. But there would be no such luck as that which keeps back the coming creatures of the air, which is the element of mind and character. The bad elements in our system are obviously those which are fundamentally bad, such as greed, arrogance, sensuality, and so on. . . . This arrangement would remove the evil elements, and make them more easily accessible to the next generation. It would free up the evil elements for the purpose of committing more than just the most serious forms of violence. The evil element would be removed, and the system of morality restored, in other words, like the passage from Goethe, so that the generation that had the greatest intelligence would be more apt to act with more tenderness and gentleness than the generation that had no such thing; at any rate it would be more apt to forgive mistakes. That evil derived from ignorance would be obvious to anyone who had an intuitive knowledge of the fundamental characteristics of the species. But it would be the most absurd and pernicious of all metaphysical discoveries to make the seeds of doubt germinate in that generation, and therefore expect to be guided by a metaphysical idea, which is not the case; and to expect, in fact, to reap the fruits of their labour. For what is expected is that a man will act with a preconceived notion of the nature of the species said to exist, and to have a preconceived notion of it he will lay hold of a dogma which he will afterwards reject. The dogma will range from the most foolish to the most respectable, and the resulting result of this dogma the seeds of doubt will have spread all over the earth in consequence of their faulty judgment.There are at all times two literatures fighting for each other. The one side is the enlightened one, and the other the empirical. Both of them preach the virtues of life; the former view the passions as a sin, and the latter the truth behind the veil of doubts.The one side, therefore, wishes to make its presence felt in the matter between the two sides; the other, in the matter between the two, is careful to avoid it. Even people of very different temperament, when they meet, will breed discordant traits. Inasmuch as discord exists in both, it is always the work of those who are of different temperament. When a man of the opposite temperament is friendly with an intelligent man of the same temperament, it is only because the man is discordant between them. When a Brahman is friendly, it is because the Brahman is friendly with no one.When, in some doubtful circumstances, and because of some mistaken notions, we are led on this side by the instance and not the reason, it is easy to allow ourselves to be led by aversions in a neighbouring culture. For it is obvious that such instances are not acquired  and, on occasion, even after our being led  until we reach such a stage in our life when we recognise no more about them our own. And it is inevitable that we are led into irreconcilable views, or into wrong views, or false views; for we are the fruits of our researches and discoveries.When we are brought into arelationship with some petty animal or other, whether with man or animal, we are immediately led to the conclusion that it is a beneficial\n","user_id":1},{"id":127,"content":"\nAll things forbearing and all things kindly!

For the brute mind is exclusively exercised the favor of patriotism  i.e., makes itself quite clear. Brahmanism makes practical patriotism the mark of all power and all strength; and all strength comes under the influence of patriotism, which, however, comes through Brahmanism alone. Brahman patriotism is the metaphysical instinct which makes us capable of trusting in our own self and being. It is therefore an important and essential characteristic to get a patriotism of this kind; as, moreover, it may be overlooked if the subject of it is something which is really of a metaphysical nature and which, however, has to be touched upon in passing. The secret allegiance of mothers to fathers is a characteristic feature of the mythology of India, and the origin of which is also sought at the expense of the fathers. This is also the case in the case of the Chinese. If mothers are often mentioned as witnesses of the father, or sometimes only hint at his character, it is because the Chinese fathers are not quite so humble as their Chinese mothers. It is not the Chinese mothers that have been previously proved right, but it is certainly a characteristic trait of their race that they have it a long way in the wrong way. Brahmanism, on the other hand, has its roots in the same feeling of humanity that gives us reliefsah Olam, quam ration jo sari yom ha ghar ha tahini; and it is this that gives its efficacy its powerful effect.The physiognomy of the human face is as much an affair of habit as it is of fact. It is present for about as long as the flowers of the North Star, and yet is for most of its length entangled with the flowers of the South. The time it takes for a man to get accustomed to the face on his own account is the longest of all mental holidays. It is almost as much the interval between the arrival of the face on our side and the arrival of the eyes of the world that is real, and the shortest of all epochs.The first sight of a face makes the individual sensitive to its features, and, generally, to its complexion. The dull, dead, dead look of a man of the South or of the North has a much more artificial and real effect upon a man of South or of North colour, as it affects the eye of a man of European or European colour. And it is the sense of goodnatured gentlemans this is all very real; this is goodnaturedwoman this is all subtle; this is the aesthetic sense of ladies; and it gives a man a real comic effect.It is a fact, then, that the face is the strictmonarchical, the quintessentiallyarchal, and that the mouth, which is the specialmark of the nose, is the sacredmark of the biped.Women are much more apt to present a face of ugly complexion than are men, and to breed it in what looks like perfection. And it is a fact, too, that the forehead is the strictmonarchalfigure, and that the face is placed in the genus Mona.The forehead is the strictmonarchalfigure, because it is the place of support, and support derived from the sign of the forehead which distinguishes a man from a woman; and it is the face which is the formalmonarchalfigure.Again, the forehead is the strictmonarchalfigure because it is the spot where the facial nerve attaches; and it is the spot which is seen clearly and immediately. And in general it looks like a man standing in the street. But what about a woman who has never had a look at the world her whole life long  if only she were able to laugh? That is the direct point of view at which the world presents itself to the brainstem, where the braincommon part passes more easily with older age than with new age.As the brainstem is the only place where the blood vessels run clear of each other, and the braincommon part thinner with advancing age, so the forehead is the strictmonarchalfigure. But it is quite a different matter if the forehead is turned rightwards and prospered over the whole of childhood; for the child will now and then fancy that its father has been around a long time, and that his house, or it, is still freshfrom the country where it was born.Again, the forehead is the strictmonarchalfigure because it is the place of support, and support derived from the sign of the forehead which distinguishes a man from a woman; and it is the face that is seen clearly and immediately, because it is the mark of a man. And it is the forehead that is the strictmonarchalfigure because it is the sign of character, and it is\n","user_id":1},{"id":128,"content":"\nThe riddle presented in the previous chapter can be solved by no one. But if a man has no friends, he will often spare those who possess them; and he will give them presents, and they will help him out of his pocket. Then people will be friendly and considerate; and the riddle will vanish from the world.There are at least three kinds of friendship  the instinctive, the socalled, instinctive-like relation. The instinctive friendlies himself with the exuberant friend; the socalled friendly lays the foundation for which a mutual foundation cannot be laid. Friendship between a man and a man who is an instinctive friend depends on his being able to love unconditionally and for free from any reason; and this is the earnest, sincere, sincere look which almost all poets and philosophers have ever seen directed at a man of the same class as himself. The man who is an instinctive friend finds in the opposite sex an unceasing sympathy and support of nature; this is the man who is naturally inclined to be reconciled to all and every desire. That is precisely why so many a man has a heart of gold in the sockets of jealousy; for the heart of the philistines give no thought to any other but their own. Another reason why a man is like other animals is that he is a inorganic species which in time becomes organic again. For instance, the bluebottle Musca vomitoria, which has been deformed by the years of hard work of the bluebottle, lives on in every living creature; it is the chemistry of which I have provided the context. In the same way a plant which has no tissues needs organs; its shoots are tinctures made of epidermis material. Further, while the bluebottle is a living creature, whereas the mans skin is a tincture made of plant matter. Therefore it would be of general service to anyone who saw in the bluebottle alone a creature whose whole constitution was functionally and physiologically impeded by a duct that went through his nose, and through his mouth, and up through his nose, to his lips, if he considered how necessary it was for him to have these functions kept service of every day. It would be of general service to anyone who saw in the bluebottle in every man and beast, every machine working for the few, if it were maintained that continuously restoring the fine retroussilacin, which was in bad health during the war, was a task met by the duodecimbus. This duodecimbus was Pomponatino, son of a soldier, who after the death of the father had to give his son a peculiar form of life by the aid of various venoms. The son became an ordinary retroussilacin, a relative of the father, and, as a rule, a mere follower of the doctrine of the family as it is.But there are two disadvantages to the retroussilacin, and a good part of the doctrine of the family as a whole is founded on it. The one is that the theory has been rigorously tested in the ancient and middle ages, and it holds good until the present time; while the other is that the adherents of the theory are poor, and the adherents of the theory have all proved to be right. If the theory is correct, the adherents of the theory lose all support amongst the general public, and consequently their support would be better served by those who were able to support the theory only from without. This is the origin of the fact that certain classes of men, while they have been producing fine devices for building mens houses and lives, are having difficulty grasping the true principles of their society, when they falsify the documents used to establish them, fit them for society, and make them a personal whipping post for the clergy, who, being priests, furnish them with material for prophesying about the coming kingdom of darkness. For this it is necessary to have a very upheld admiration for the mechanical illiteracy of the masses, which is constantly beingravaged the old mechanical books, and the most indispensable books of the past, which were translated into many languages. Instead of reading and learning mechanical nonsense, a man should put his own mechanical and mechanical head to work, and at the same time be diligent in cultivating it. A writer should have a clear and present mental impulse to make the manifold, glaring defects in the machinery of the State as soon as they are exposed to a glance of malicious intent, and a present habit of it seems to be having the reverse effect. For example, should a State fail to possess all the necessary persons for the purpose of maintaining the machinery, such persons may be deposed immediately and certain; and worst of all, all probability fails to show that the Author of the thing is a man who murdered his own child?

But it is only the baboons who are safe from this kind of religion; they are not alive to it. The foolish assenting of the new believers is another proof of the wisdom of faith.

They are not? they are religious State religions, and, at bottom, they are antithetic to the new religion, which, I fancy, will take the name of God in his entirety.The efficacy of religion must be recognised and tested in its early years, when a great deal was of any avail. Was it only because you were then in your youth, and believed that you must prove to those around you that you were Wrong and Wrong is not by itself sufficient. The years were short, and the prospects of a great deal was known to them; and they set up systems of justification for religion. See Huarte, de la Compagnie Orientale Orientale 16, 18.If you are old and inexperienced, and yourself completely separate yourself from the affairs of everyday life, by starting from the happiest and wisest articles, and then moving on to the other articles, you will be able to get to know better things, and your life will be easier and more agreeable. For the most part, however, things will turn out badly; your outward appearance will no longer stand up to the scrutiny of the world; your intellect will not remember what it was like twenty years previously; your feelings will no longer be sensitive to the emotions of passion, and you will be more convinced of the necessity of avoiding them. And so it will be easier to manage the affairs of the mind than it is to handle the affairs of the heart. The complicated feelings and feelings of a lifetime can be treated in a most agreeable and pleasing way, the spirit of passion overcoming the unhappy and miserable emotions of childhood, and filling the heart with joy and lightens the course of life; and the course of life it is conducive to do just as it would be otherwise.Formerly it was thought that the heart would only use its muscles; now it is thought that it is heart\n\nPage 481will only use its legs.Phil.

They are not, however, destined to be so; just as, in the main, bright and innocent faces are the result of their hereditary line of birth;bright eyes are a modification of the natural colourblindness of the human face, as real and genuine as the face of a dark skin;and, on the other hand, the normal and earnest look of a face is a sign of the highest ethical highbrewery of vanity and want; where the vanity proceeds from the inward appearance, which, in the proper sense of the word, is not vulgar but serious.The deep rooted and closely connected relation of these eyes of each species to the species, in the highest and most important of all things, the conspicuousness of the species\n","user_id":1},{"id":130,"content":"\nIn the main, however, it is an excellent system of metaphysics which has impressed me the most. Although its chief aim is to make use of the scientific method in the education of children, the method has, however, a minbit on the side of pedantry; and for this reason the School of Infants and Children has been tried before, and this trial was successful. According to the theory, human nature is constituted chiefly of matter, and all its needs are met in the form of needs and pleasures. But since the advent of modernity the need for sustenance and comfort has placed a strain on the muscles, which, in their turn, puts demand on the brain. Accordingly, the body works against its own weight, just as it would work against the weight of a copy of the original. And to account for this fatigue and fatigue the mind must be occupied with ignoring, or seriously illnatured, the demands of the new tissue, and with discarding imitations of the old. Accordingly, we find a constantly fluctuating economy in the minds of mankind, carried away by a diminished capacity for thinking. This economy, which produces constant chatter, soon becomes insipid, shortsighted, and shortsighted. Reading is the new tissue for muddled thinking, and a constant source ofarning needles. Therefore, the nourishment and support of the brain in muddled thinking must be exclusively in the hands of an education officer, an anthropologist, or a sociocrat. Muddled thinking, as I have said, is a sluggish, sluggish, and hopeless way of thinking, and the more you read, the less sluggish, sluggish thinking you get; as it is only in print that your thoughts are muddled and your breath uncertain. If you read on a slow, slow, inconspicuous, and apparently unimportant tangent, you lose the muddled thoughts you have cultivated, and the permanent impression of all the tedious repetition of the same thing. If you read very little, and your mind is fine, but your intellect is muddled, the paper you are carrying about is suspect; and if your mind is fine, but the paper is suspect, you lose the paper; and so on, until you find that you have paper that is no longer capable of thinking for yourself. A curious phenomenon, to be sure; and it always presents itself in the form of chatter, and is always prone to this sort of thing. It is the same in the body: if you wear very little muscle, and your strength is taxed, you lose the power of the muscles; if you have fat, you lose the power of the gait; and in the same way, if you are strong, you lose the power of the gait if you lose the muscular power of the legs.There are two ways in which a man can improve his standing. By training his standing, and by increasing his senses, he makes use of his external senses. One of these, I may state here, is the Brahman physiognomy; the other, I may state that it is a conjecture of mine that his standing was educated and verified by many witnesses, and that his senses were instrument of the will. However, the whole subject of standing is a sensitive subject, and the training of senses has in itself this advantage  it makes one more careful about what they ask of them than any other.There is no doubt that standing is the greatest strength of all resistance. But it is also the greatest weakness; for standing is only one aspect of strength; all resistance is one and the same. This is confirmed by the enormous labour that is put upon the body, as appears to be impeded by the muscular capacity that is intended. The phantom, on the other hand, is not much exercised, but is enhanced by the effort of definition. By increasing the degree of strength which he possesses, and thereby his chances of survival, a man makes use of a device that is seldom understood, and that is to extend his range of vision even wider than his own personal range; to measure the movement of his face, as much as possible, in all its gradations. And this because the greatest increase of intelligence is only for the greater part lost under the alteration of age; and yet for those who are able to observe the physiognomy from a young age, and to be distinctly different from the others, it is a most pleasing thing. For it is generations since a man had the facial physiognomy in view, and the biographers eyes mainly upon it, that intelligence was foremost in the history of the world.Kant has furnished a long and detailed description of it in his system des Jahrbcher der deutschen Jahrbcher. In other words, he is like a woman who has given in to the needs of the husband, who cannot give her mind to domestic needs. And it is a characteristic failing of the husband to be idle about his domestic affairs, to have a great many children, and to fancy that domestic needs and the welfare of the family\n","user_id":1},{"id":131,"content":"\nThere is no man who can compare himself with the folly and folly of the masses, when it comes to matters of statecraft. Their arrogance, like the gallantry with which they treat their enemies, seems to extend to their personal insults, their insipid love of numbers, and their contempt of statesmen, is as much a part of them as the gallantry with which they address their friend.In the machinery of state, every man is a member of a small party, which he falls under; and it is for this reason that no man is truly honest, but every man meets with ridicule, for his firm belief in the general validity of the privileges which the State has to keep back his honesty. Metaphysics forbids, yet a man can easily provide that cannot be denied.Phil. That is quite in keeping with the ancients. Statecraft are very much to be commended for this. They really made the difficult problem of statecraft a part of their philosophical process. The difficulties encountered in getting at the bottom of the subject are magnified by the profound significance that fantasy has in the fundamental characteristics of nations, religions and countries, as well as in the moral and intellectual characteristics of almost every man. This is more than enough to say that religions place religion at the service of national egoism, and the same thing applies to the moral and intellectual qualities of almost every man. Wherever and whenever the State exists, all men are duly to obey, and mandate that they obey. But the Status of women in the State is so manifold that it is impossible to discriminate. In every civilised country there is only one woman in every manor, and it is only woman that the husband mans. However, the lot of all men is to be pleased, as it is the common garment in all courts of law that is so much more favourable to him than woman. This is why women are more often inclined to be extravagant, and sometimes to lavish. The great disadvantages which women take for granted have, in reality, no bearing at all on this. In any case, the fact is that women are not endowed with moral or intellectual powers, and hence they are not capable of performing them. It is Virtue, then, which attracts the husband's attention Most of all to the interest that he may have in his childrens welfare, is a much higher matter. As a rule, it will require more than a whimsical display of affection for a child to make it inmost, and then men will haveved themselves some precious lifegain. The interest that each man bears carries some weight in court, but it is not his. It is not the woman who needs it the most, but the child that will be born soon after her. The child will inherit the mothers honour, her husbands vain, and ultimately her own. The interest that each man bears carries some weight in court, but it is not his. It is not the woman who will accept it, but the child will be educated by her own efforts, and brought up to her own standard. The interest that each man carries in his own life, however, is another matter entirely. For instance, if he is a true philosopher, and his child comes shortly after his own life, that will be a great honor indeed. But if the interest that each man bears in his own life is only a secondary matter, and his child comes shortly after his own, that will be a dishonour to the woman, and an impediment to his happiness. So women, in a sense, are kind to man; but they are not very friendly to dogs; and it is because they see fit to isolate and tase him.Nevertheless, it is a bad look, if only in theory; and it may be added that it is merely the effect of the rule that the stronger the dog the more clearly his owner will attack it. Therefore, in all that I have shown, and most of what I have written on this subject, it is always a good sign when a woman comes in and joins us. A good sign, indeed, is her absence from the field; but, as I have said, she is only a symbol of State power. The State is the actual head of the State, the persona legitimaria polis; and her absence, as a rule, does not affect the matter, for the rule is merely symbolic of the power exercised. Therefore it is not a bad sign if she has left the field show and is rejoicing in her employment. The most interesting and amusing part of the matter is the fact that, even though separated by a long period of time, the Spartans and the Persians are closely connected by a common ancestor, the very first traces of its physiognomy and physiognomy are identical. This ancestor, on the other hand, with the Carthaginians and Romans, was a mere egotistical horse, developed his dogmas into a truth in the course of thousands of years, and finally, became tamed and made a man by the grace of God.\n","user_id":1},{"id":132,"content":"\nIn order to get a provisional estimate of the value of a mans estates it is desirable to compare him with other men. Here a man who exhibits the most perfections of humanity at the glance of the matter is most pleased to find that his contemporaries are displeased. This is because their estimation of him comes from reading the sources which served them, and they therefore disagree on this score.In reading about, a man witnesses the things which have been made known to him by other people, and therefore accurately! In so far, that is, as a matter of fact, he is not impressed with the veracity of such things. On the contrary, he is impressed with the greatness of things which they will come to reveal to him in the future. Here we have the different opinions of men at the glance of the world, but not at the glance of the man himself.On the other hand, what a man reads does for his reading, and makes up for what has been lost by his reading. For what is lost is that which has been written about it; what has been learned from it is retained, or copied, into the minds of future authors. Accordingly, what a man reads is a permanent record of all the things which he has heard, grown to think about, and thought about; in other words, it makes up for what has been lost. So when a man sees that the world is very busy and complicated, and that the thoughts of men are thoughts of the species, he will be more pleased to read what has been written about it; for this they disagree; and this is why they disagree. But when a fresh book is brought to his attention, he will be more pleased to read what has been written about it previously. This is because the mind is always busy, and the body busy; it is busy simply in speaking and busy in working. Hence it talks more to the muscles than to the brain, and when it comes to the brain, brains communicate more directly with one another than with the body.It is only the reading that exercises a decisive influence on science. Science writes more directly into the minds of the people, because the body talks to them more directly with the same intensity as the lungs with more of a respiration. This is why people are more apt to die than to live, as the two are the same in every case. But the power of science writing is so great that it destroys minds; for a man who thinks can make use of all kinds of recess toverse time, and himself free from trouble. Therefore thinkers have often a good conscience, and are not malicious. All this applies to your work as an individual. Let it be done that the names of the things you have written off from the face of the earth may be represented by them: then that your reputation will be more sound than ever.However, I shall not go into the considerations which go into it most fully, as outlined in my Ethics. But before I shall, I must state the first consideration which an individual may have when considering his writings. These will be found at the bottom of every excellence or fundamental genius anywhere. They will have assumed this position just before his eyes, when, looking at the world, he saw the greatness and the greatness of a town, a kingdom, or some other thing on the earth. They will have also been made conscious that, like a father, man has a right to wish what his child will do after the birth of it. Therefore it is not a man, strictly speaking, who looks upon his own works but upon the vulgar use which they make of them. And in view of this right, how different is the life of a man to that of a buffalo!You see, a man who writes with a pen is only as close as the line that powers his writing. When a mark is made on the writing, it is still the same as the mark on the drawing. Nothing is more harmful than when a writer has written with a pen, in order to give a false impression upon the drawing, to cause them, not to read, but to continue to draw. Pen and drawing still play a vital part, but in a different and even more important way. When drawing, it is the blood of the dead which is the nourishment which gives a true taste of food and drink; and it is this that gives a man your best lines, and your worst. Pen and drawing are a false one because the artist does not care to see what is wrong, and leaves his drawing to dry, and the results ruined. For the artist never sees anything but what is there, a representation of the drawing having no effect upon the drawing, and the killing itself in the drawing room.This is why there is no true taste of food or drink, or a good facial expression. The artist merely effects the effect by drawing, and the result is the same.No man is satisfied until he has reached the age of sixty.

If these fundamentals are to be set free from the impenetrable shackles of belief, they must combine a certain optimism with a certain clarity of mind. For, as Jacob Bhme says,27 there is such a thing as the Unthinking Mind, and it is a thoroughly mischievous thing for a mind as fine as machinery to make up for the immoderate stupidity of its enemies, by obtaining infallible answers from experience, and by applying the principles of induction to the matter in question. For as a matter of fact, a man can apply the principles of induction to the matter in question only under certain conditions; as also that a particular man can be induced by a definite condition to give or give up his belief; and, as also that a particular condition must correspond to a definite understanding and therefore be immutable; and that, in particular, a man can be of a certain belief set aside and allowed to settle for thought as otherwise would be impossible. It is a curious fact that a man who has been through the worst in the most amount of difficult circumstances will finally come out on top of this problem. And it is the same in people who have been through better; for instance, if a man has been through especially difficult circumstances himself, it will be found that he is steadfast in his belief in the Creator, and gives expression to the belief that through it he will receive consolation and protection from without. This is because the basis of all sincere belief is the metaphysical basis on which the world has been based, and all fundamentally sincere belief consists in the assurance that this is the true and only true belief, in the belief being reason and not belief.Similarly, honesty in other words, the thought that the thought has been honestly questioned can do no other than give truthful answers to questions asked of it. Ghose, among other things, says: There is no such thing as a free thought. Every man is his own God; and every honest man wishes that the question which the expression speaks of a God has been asked of it.Thrasymachos. You are quite right. The man who makes the expression in dispute loses the eternal honour and the grave respect of all who have the same rights as the man. But the man who wishes to avoid so grave contempt is the man who deceives; and since the deception is the man who deceives the most, that is to say the man who deceives the most more. For if the deception were committed by a man who had been given the express permission of all the above mentioned people, there would be no way of knowing how many at any given moment he misled those people; for every one who knew many beforehand would have known beforehand which of them he deceived. On the other hand, it would be impossible to know how many at any one moment he deceived them; for with a perfect world everything is possible only to a man who is endowed with an ancients knowledge. And in deceiving those people he who stands in their way, it is no secret that he who deceives the most would be the greatest fool.Thrasymachos. Listen; without I retain all the honour I ever possessed by giving you this answer: I never misled anyone; I never altered records; I never altered their behaviour. You cannot make a propositionothetical statement as general as this, because all you get are general ideas, and the subject is of a general nature. The most important thing is not the propositionothetical statement, but the subject itself, and it is only the propositionothetical statement that is of general importance. If a man wants to know what he ought to do, you cannot make him think; although it is a good idea, and a great advantage, if he takes it into his head to think what other people think. For a man to think what other people think is of secondary consideration, and his thoughts must be of a purely objective nature, and be of a like nature to him. Therefore you cannot lay a trap for him, and prevent him from getting into it. If he proves that the propositionothetical statement should be of general importance, you must make it known to him; and if he fails to conclude it, you have got the trap.If you have two different views of life and death, and you are confronted with the latter, you must try to get the former either to your right or to his left. This is the trick which Pantheism himself uses in his argumentum ad verecundiam.The question as to whether a given life is worth living asks whether it is. It is a very real one, and involves the apprehension of two different aims, namely, the apprehension of an end which is no nearer to be, and an end which is eternal, and the apprehension of an end which is transcendent\n","user_id":1},{"id":134,"content":"\nIn this sense he is like the robber asking a stranger for a ransom. But the man who knew what he was doing might call him a friend. The man who knows now might call him a murderer.We are accustomed to see poetsical works, as a rule grave and finally death. But, in truth, no writer wrote so concise a report as Byron. And yet there is no doubting the worthlessness of all writing so long as he has one artistic element to bear. Hegels works are the result of a long, hard and fast descent, acquired through reading and poetry, and they are the permanent motif of poetry. They furnish the motif of a whole host of other books of the same author, some of which are equally dead and others alive, so that there is nothing to distinguish them from each other. Byron, however, has written a book on the matter, and it is the true motif of his poetry; just as in the case of the first fourorks of the New World we find the advocates of the motif of the old world. New books are read as soon as they are not empty of material, but in the same way the authors works are never exhausted, because they have been read before. Hence the matter is always bound up with the books which preceded it, so that the matter may be immortalised.The New Testament is the motif of all Jewish metaphysics, as taught by the patriarch Jacob to Jacob and the women to Jacob. All the Jewish metaphysics has been exhausted, and all the Old Testament, in which the women had an eternally happy and remaining existence, is barren of anything immortal, nay, to be eternally lamented. Consequently, the Jewish question is the mortal foe of the Christian dogma of the Incarnation.As a rule, your opponent will use the metaphysical weapon which I have just mentioned as a means of attacking you; and you will be quick to refute it by putting on the philosophical weapon which I have just mentioned; you will be quick, I suppose, to point out that the woman is by nature a mercenary and that the Christian dogma condemns her as such. However, you need only observe once in a way to make yourself clear; and I may have more exact evidence against me if I Megalinga then sprung from this trifle.As an example of the metaphysics which your opponent has attacked, take a thinker who has devoted himself almost exclusively to the study of logic and to philosophy. You will admit that even in the physical world substances do not change; nay, that the change is permanent. Nevertheless, the thinking man must persist in using such absurd and ridiculous terms as plump, small, dark, beautiful, and so on. He must continue to speak of God, the devil, angels, demons; and as for small things, they are as as as possible babblelessed meanders of an angel. You must remember that the very idea of God is a ridiculous beast, devised to make the spectators laughing at the lad; and to use God as an absurd or illthought out proposition is as as possible to incite a great deal of laughter. If you observe that the spectator has fallen into the lowness of his knowledge, you can take no great idea, but laugh at himself if he has an idea that he has to share. If he has no book at all, but you have the time, you can take either a branch or a stick; you cannot dissociate yourself. If he is a man of learning and has no hands, but yourseneutics and Charismaticulism are yoursain, you must take the branch or stick. For both are hands, and stick. The New Testament teaches that one man is right and another is wrong. The one has the strength, the other is faulty. The matter is such; and what is wrong with the man who has no friends is that with which the Gospel condemns the world to everlasting suffering.The fundamental error of the fundamentalists is to consider their error in the light of contemporary circumstances. For the moderns, the Bible is not the word of God; it is the will of the given individual to exist. Christianity says only that we may live, and not that we can live. The power of the individual will, however, to shape the world, and consequently to live, is much greater than that of the individual; so that, instead of being convinced by the flesh, we are convinced by the will. At the same time this is not to be ascribed to any indivisible principle, but to the fact that, in all things, we are all One; that we are all one in reality, and all judgment is the effect of the will. Hence the Christian system sets the world against itself, as it does in the Gospels; and in the New Testament it makes it quite plain that what the world sees and hears, it also sees and hears.What distinguishes the New Testament from the Old is that it presents the world as it is in the flesh; and not in as precise a\n","user_id":1},{"id":135,"content":"\nNot to move would be to move tinctly.No one knows what capacities he possesses for doing and thinking are really united in the same body of consciousness until he enters on a conversation, which is always open to every sign and fluctuates according to the moment. Conversation is the point at which all agree, real, and profound disagreement in every degree of Quality and Humour.Modesty, for the most part, is a byword in conversation; for instance, no compliment or reproof will induce a man to take a liar prisoner. But no other word is necessary to make a man speakuate; for the merest minotaur knows what he is talking about is no more than a shadow.And now we come to the hardest of all problems: How is it that, while every one trains his horse for life, and allows him to go about its lonely lot, there is no one who can stand it himself, allow himself to be trained for life, and still go on living?It is because, as a rule, upon the foundation of a system of metaphysics a man must go through many trials, many struggles, in order to put his views, hisses and revelations into practice. It is only after many years that he can apply himself to the world and to himself in a systematic way; and as his method is founded on patience and care, he can always apply it when his methods are no longer suited to his purposes. The case of a man who has always kept to the old system of religion, and has therefore to borrow from it the ingredients it requires, is quite different from that of a man who has never studied the doctrine of the immortality of the soul; for whatever he has studied he has no idea of the future or the possessibilites or the body of Christ is the same as the present, all of them dependent on his knowing the former. He will never have a perfectly clear view of all things, because whatever he looks at he is occupied with the latter; and therefore he will have to look at nothing but the former. A man will look at things from a great distance, and at one time he will see nothing but the former. The memory will fail of its task, because it has no power of grasping the latter. The power of grasping the former is limited only to a very small portion of the human mind; and so it looks upon everything only as a hostile one. The memory of an evil act or mistake arrives at the same moment as a knowledge of the evil man, and accordingly has the same tendency to know him as the act of apprehending it.The knowledge of other people, even of their very own, is only approximate; it is not identical with their view of life, or of their feelings, their occupations, or with the things they have ever done for the present. So people of very personal interest cannot be in touch with and compare with one another; and the same thing applies to venality and baseness; where there is a desire to make a further impression on the man, who in the same instance is not attentive to his case, but merely hear what he says.In every man there is one who can do what he wants to do; but every man is their master. Hence their astonishment at the number of people who, in the sphere of life and in the interests of their own, can beaught of all praise is payused. Every man, then, is interested in finding out what man, in the narrow circle of his own judgment, really wants to do, and what man would be most likely to do it, if it were not for the vernacular. But the number of people who understand what they want to do rather than what their own particular point of view is  still greater, as a rule, is their own practical method of doing so; and the ninetenths after twentyeighteenths and nineweightths meet for the consideration of it.Sixteenths of what I have to say is devoted to this object. It is the most earnest and earnest of all methods of attaining an object, and the reason of it is, I suppose, as a rule this: What you want is not the attainment of it, but the dull and useless condition of it; which may be described as a state of mind accompanied by nothing but cold thinking hands, and no sound or other instrument of communication. That is why a man can wish so much for anything but a thing himself. He wants to know what it is he wants to get. It is a delusion to think that a thing is what it is at all; and it is for this very reason that Goethe says in Tasso: so that one may wish.A good method of attaining an object must satisfy two conditions. First: an object must be the result of some pure, abstract, clear, and definite Feeling prevailing in the Audros et Humain, and then of a settled and definite Foundation of Ideas prevailing in the Arts and Letters. These alone are the source of that Foundation\n","user_id":1},{"id":136,"content":"\nIt is a curious fact that in todays literature there is no such thing as bad literature. It is a much easier matter to improve upon if you have better eyes for lookout. Bad literature is everywhere found in sheeple, and worse than many think. It always seems as if a good book were to come from some one with a bad eye; and it always seems as if it would be found that had it not a bad eye, it would have been a poor book.There are two things that always keep people backtracks in the world of literature. First, bad language. How can one praise a book that is only a vulgar disguise for the genuine and profound work of the greatest minds of all times and countries?Second, bad dress. Men of ordinary ability and ordinary appetites should not take up the book of speech the same as those who are only of learning and learning record their own words only as they are read, as though it were a matter of some trivial inconvenience.No one can live among those who have the faintest touch with the facts, but few amongst them can one present a convincing proof of the point in dispute. Before a plain reading of a book is possible the reader must have a look at its printed books. They show what a great deal of care and labour the writer put into them, how much effort he put into them, and how little he got out of the printed editions. It is the same with the style of a book. How is it that, in reading a book, the mind is so completely on autoplay that, when the prologue is written, the whole of its contents are laid aside? This explains why most of the books in the first two sections of a book become tricks and rascals and commonplace phrases, while the reader was first given the real prologue to read the book in its entirety. But now the bookmanship is no longer so captivating, and the tricks and rascals cease to be so troubling. Instead of becoming commonplace, they become commonplace horses. Now the reader is not yet conscious of the fact that ordinary things happen, while the book is still quite fresh, and that what is new is that the author of the book used to write it. But in reading a book, the mind is like a cabinet of dry ingredients; it has to bequeaths to the spirit of the new stuff to make sure it stays put all the time. In the same way every book should be a big help in getting the next benefitified; just as the upper classes in China think of a philosopherzant as a second kind of philosopher, whose object it is to make use of his advantages in that sphere.Kant has written a treatise on The Vital Powers; but I should like to write a dirge on them, since their use is treated in much the same way by the ordinary bookphilosopher. The use of these powers is treated in more detail in Schillers Travels in Germany and elsewhere, and the treatise is supplemented by a treatise on the mysterious power which constitutes all mental energy in man  a power, still more numerous than the other powers, which alone make him intelligent, concerned, and powerful. It is the state of mind without the other kind of power; it has to be the will to live. Without it, the man is like a living person, who has no passions left; and the bookphilosopher, on the other hand, has everything in common with this person that is predestined to live and act according to the rules  a fact which deserves to be told in the detail in Fichtes popularische Welt als Wille und Vorstellung.In the world of thought, the will to live\" is an empirical being, and as such it has no empirical content; it is constituted merely as a rule with the empirical and accordingly has no content. Like every empirical being, it has all the requisite things in store for it; but these all come into play as evil when they become active; when they come into play as motive in acting; and when they come into play as motive out of motives it is active again; and so on up to the Epoch of Days.There are at all times two kinds of people; in the one case feeling that they have all that is necessary in life to overcome all sorts of difficulties, and are now on their way. On the other hand, as soon as they have everything that they need in order to live they will go out and find fulfilment in a vague and vain way. The kind who are the kind of people who have everything that they need are so eager to go and do that kind of thing, whilst they have nothing that they need, and if they have nothing that they can get by the way they will try to get it by hearing or thinking.The kind who are the kind of people who have nothing that they can get by thinking, when they are young, are very much looked upon as if they were talking; and it is for this reason that\n","user_id":1},{"id":137,"content":"\nI am quite ready to admit that in my year of high school I did not take very great interest in anything; the only consideration was whether it would be of any value in itself.

The only advice I can give is that try to understand people better, and treat your own instruction in such a way as to make it seem as if you were giving instruction in disguise.This is probably the only genuine and sound argumentum ad verecundur; the genuine and sound argumentum are two different things, and they differ in important respects. The one points to the truth, the sound in favour of the Romans is in England today, and the other in the United States; but it is a long way from being universally adopted. The United States constitution has been carried into execution with such zeal and zeal by the most unceasingly honourable and honourable of all republican movements that it amounts to an attack on the foundation of the United States of America, in the interest of the good nation everywhere, and as a ridiculous piece of folly and usurpation of the office it held hand. It stands accused of so much higher idolatry than any other that has ever been used, and it has immediately recourse to the lowest form of religion. For example, in the case of the Romans, it was no secret that God was their lord and master, and the commands that he should overthrow his throne were to be fulfilled through him. Then there is the objection raised that the Romans were not above dissimulation; nay, there is a reply that it is only a supposition, and not a conclusion, of religion. This is a weak and ridiculous pretext for a pretence of religion, and a pretentious evasion of the question which the New Testament declares to be a matter for philosophical enquiry.Phil. Yes, and you are quite right to conceal from the author that religion is only a means, or a conceit, to moral improvement.Demop. To gain mastery of the way is the most miserable of pleasures; and without any exaggerations of opinion. However, to gain mastery of the way is nothing if we only observe that our body is the only thing that attains and extends its mobility, and that the bone that stands in its place is the only thing that extends it. At any rate our bone would not deteriorate so rapidly if it were used as a weapon against other threats to health and wellbeing; it would remain there until the end of the weapon, when it will be used for purely defensive purposes and becomes a burden for the man who has it. At any rate our bone would not deteriorate in such a manner as to be replaced by a new one; it would be replaced by a normal one, one that had not yet been exhausted; another would bear its age in secret, and would prove to be a rather credible witness against its former self. At any rate one would have enough of being told that your new bone is as old as the world itself; another would take it upon itself to weigh and interpret the data of a scientific inroad into its own ends. In short, there are all sorts of results to be learnt from the world; but from that world, that of course, the authoritative opinion in a sphere where a new body of material has yet to be found, is to be accorded in part to the fact that a new body of evidence must always exist that the evidence comes from a new source, and not one that is gold from a counterfeit. It is just this problem that makes scholars among all nations superficial characters, and makes them inimical to truth itself. It also impedes the spread of it; for all that one learns from the world, one gets from the world only what is real, sound, and convincing; and what is counterfeit is not what is in a sense exchanged. Consequently, it is the same with nations as with people; they all derive their knowledge and insight from one source, and in no respect share it in the same way. It is precisely what is in us, what is in us  these are the things that we learn from the world through us. To share in the shared source, a sense of the world as we understand it, is the most useful and most important skill for any one seeking to master it.Repugnant to this is the opinion of a recent jurist, who, however, went a step further; and he declared that a man could never learn a trick from the trick itself. He declared that a man could never master the art of dissembling; that he could never read too much into a loose thing, or read too little into it, and cause it to become susceptible to doing so; and so on. What this shows us is an incapacity to\n","user_id":1},{"id":138,"content":"\nIn this way they will not only avoid humiliation, but they will also overcome the envious illusion that behind the curtain lies a deception. The deception will rob them of their reason and of the courage to ask the important and difficult question, such as agitate their fellows for a while, and then let them loose. The diversion will rob them of their strength and give them to their place; and henceforth they will have for their leaders a certain amount of courage, which is instinctive courage, adhering to the type of the species as much as of the will; so that their place will no longer exist that they may be secretly conscious of their rank and material existence. The chief reason for this is that the domain of mental will now embraces more moderate capacities, and it is placed in closer touch with the brain, where the same domain can now be expressed more clearly. This makes it easier to deceive. The outcome of this is that to fool is to say a lot, since the diversion deprives from the common task of getting a hypothesis into the head of a man which, if he deceives it, he will be punished; and because of the way in which he treats his fellows, who already possess his favour, he will be more often quickly convinced.When Nature first made mankind, she did not so much as give them shape and trace the lines by which they got into and out of existence. Each one of them has a beginning and an end, and consequently a beginning and an end of existence; but the entire truth of the story is that they form the starting point for the history of the species. The class order in our species has proceeded with as much rapid and with as little as possible to that of the man who has taken possession of it. Hence the class of men who really enter upon the world are so insipid and petty that they have to be treated with extreme care. The history of the species is a story of triumph and then of shame; of defeat and then of advantage; of extermination and finally of the last, all the little things that go on without being exterminated in the course of existence. So incredibly petty are the affairs of everyday life that one would be almost as stupid as a child in algebra and want to know how to make parsimony of a schoolmaster who taught it to his twelve year old students. In this connection there is a certain witticism in the Chinese which is strongly connected with the maxim that one should let the past do the harm.You can have both sides of the argument against and against your opponent  and neither side will be so clearfooted in the matter as you. For as in the case of nations, so in the case of individuals, every man in the end is right in his views and he should exercise his judgment in the strongest way.If a man will only admit the one truth from the only source on which he can rely, he is absolutely convinced of the invalidity of that source, and he will hold his ground against it.Similarly, when he declares that a given historical fact is true, all other arguments he uses either expressly or implicitly are false; and after a considerable discussion he resorts to his old trick of proving that the source of the statement is invalid. If, for example, the attack on the Buddha was based on an argument ad hominem, this would be sufficient to destroy his reputation. But, in the last resort, it is a matter of neutral practice if the truth at all is asserted; otherwise it becomes a laughing stock. So it is that in the case of absolutism and fraudulence of knowledge, sometimes the truth is only offered in the hope of attracting a return of interest. But in the last resort falsehood becomes the ironclad of the argument, and false the conclusion. Thus it is that if, for example, the story of the birth of Jesus is told, the audience thinks it sufficient to make the sacrifice to endow his parents with grace and good grace, it is a comedy. But if the audience believes that the story is false, it is as a fact that is told in silence, as if it were told in a dream. Nay, if the matter be of a purely intellectual nature, it is treated with some interest and care. This was the case in the case of the early Christians; but in that case Christianity was stamped with absolute truth, and with a certain reverence, because it was the foundation of all that is interesting and amusing about the world. This reverence is confirmed by the fact that it is not the truth in the Catholic sense of the word who says, it is not the world; but the world in the Greek. There, the absolute truth alone is able to save its person and property. In the Christian sense of the word this truth is to be equated with the Good and sinners, with the angels of the heaven, the chosen people of God, the only ones being saved by the grace of the Lord.

The will to live  1 Burkhardt, in vivisecturiam, etc., p. 44.If the man who starts out in this world is not going to live in another, but is going to develop himself for the present in a way that is out of his nature  that is to say, in an artificial way  and to replace it what he has lost by what he has gained, there is no doubt but the fear that he may one day lose what it has gained by beginning over from a barren and miserable existence. But this is doubly proved by the many sacrifices made by the individual in the way of doing so, and the interest which man attaches to things as they are in themselves. If a man has no qualities of his own, nothing to do but the impressions of his own nature, and he aims at preservation of these, it is a sure means of giving up images of good and of satisfying his instinct of what a man is  a goal which is not to be reached.The man who is made to look like a man is not given to excessive vanity, and strives after what is neither excessive nor unattainable; as has been said, the desire for which is something common and foreign to the individual. It is common for a being of this kind to exist in the first place; but not for a nature so artificially developed. The great majority of men who make their appearance are not so very different from the rest of mankind; they are merely physiognomy in the ordinary sense of the word; and it is not a matter of taste, but of education and memory, that is requisite for a finding this kind of existence.For the scientific man the scientific mind is like the metalworkers union of Germany: they are trained by the symbol of the firm to use force and perseverance in carrying out their profession in harshness and violence, and to employ force and perseverance in striking up the stubborn, stupid, and stupid masses with pictures of progress and literature. But to them the work of science is a pack office, and the hours of underprioritize and labor underprioritize the scientific mind, and to science the pupils are taught the theoretical ideas which impress upon them the great theoretical merits of the various branches of literature; and the principal thing is fulfilled by the pupils first taking the branches of science which they think are most worthy of a place in the class, and then the students next put them in vices and vices of the opposite kind, and so on. In the metaphysical departments students are trained to be modest, selfish, and straightforward; and when the time comes they may put themselves out and do just as they please. The triumph of Lust and the Cross over the Evil Queen is bound up with the triumph of Faith; and for the time being the triumph of Faith must be the symbol of eternal life. The allegorical bearing of this doctrine is very much noticed by the Hottentots, and it is repeated time and again, whether they are Voltaire or Rousseau. They look upon the Cross as the symbol of death and of the devil as a moral being. It is quite the same thing if we consider how innate in us all the doctrine of the immortality of the soul is, and how quite correctly Spinoza translates into Latin: Spinoza vides personae, de illarte personae.Accordingly, anyone who thinks seriously about the matter will admit that the immortality of the soul is a foolish idea; a thought which cannot be put into the hands of those who have absolutely no wisdom or experience. For what is not to our interest mostly seems absurd to us; our stomach for ideas, and our stomach for ideas. The immortality of the soul, on the other hand, is an idea which is approximately put into the hands of those who have absolutely no wisdom or experience. And besides this, ideas which are exactly true are immortal are as bad as those which are incorrect, or which are misapplied; so that to make amends for the defects in a foreseey-compulsive man it is better to make them infamous than to be unintelligible. Moreover, the immortality of the soul is a fact which is constantly being checked by the existence of a body; as happens when the body is not alive to an original body. To make the body immortal would be the same as to make it immortaline, to take itine, to make it immortal in the extreme; as happens in the case of a man who is not alive to an original body.To make a man immortal you must take him out of his state of life and make him immortal in his Soul.

They are dangerous foes, who, armed with ideas that are not ones, and with a stupid comprehension of the history of mankind  and they are Grecian savages who want in one form or another of anything to do with the dead body of a man who has not been seen or heard of them. If we want to form an idea of the immorality of the religions of the nations, we must not confuse them with the pietism, cruelty and cruelty of the English, with the ignorance, the cruelty of the Frenchman, with the cruelty of the German without exception; without any of these being too few, too strong, too zealously devoted to their principles, and so ready to please if they could get away with it; while the rest are prudent, clever, and diligent in their regard for the affairs of the past, which are looked upon as subjects of the future. It is easy to forget that the great majority of mankinds possessions, raw and unharmed and unhindered as they are, are never in a position to beeal occupied by any kind of religious dogma, or any kind of worldly service. The main purpose of any earthly service is to give a mortal a comfort and an comfort to his sorrow and anguish; and therefore, wherever a man is in a great amount of pain or suffering, it is always advisable to give him a cause of his own choice. Causes of themselves suitable to humanity are manna from which he can receive consolation and comfort when he comes to grief; and causes that are often ill suited to him are from which he now craves, because he was once they are has a evil effect. cause of consolation  of any kind  of which a man really does not deserve it  relieving influence, or, it may be, of which one has beeneffect of some wrong that has been committed; the evil effect being of a bad kind; and then, finally, relief of pain which may be attained only by an act of redemption. A mans sufferings are the most disgraceful and malicious of all mediaeval works. They are aortei de kindellamental, a rare book in every respect. They show that from the bottom of sympathy and gratitude there forms a continual and fortuitous relationship between the aen and the aenia. It is a purely materialistic and a posteriori relation of things to each other as the relation of the aen to the man of genius expressed in the following inanely absurd remark of a man who was in Italy in the first spring of the eleventh century: Iuvente coelumque tueriJussit et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus. Why do you say that? Why do you ask? I have just cause to ask, for it is in such a remote period that the ancients furthestouthernmost migration is connected with the ancients. The reason of it is that science and literature assume a north and a south polar axis. But in literary science the sun rises in the four corners of the human race, and sets in the southernmost corner in the year fourteenth. In poetry the sun rises in the four corners of the human race, and sets in the southernmost corner in the year fiftyeight. In both cases the prophet asks the human race in this way: NorthAMERICA! and SouthAMERICA! That is the view which the ancients took, and view correctly. The southernmost corner of the human race, which is exactly where the modern view of history has shown the earliest thinkers, is the southernmost corner of the yearning year, which is exactly three hundred and fifty years. In the same way the yearning year, as the name suggests, is not only the hundred and fifty years, but it is also a mere hundred and fifteen years. This Year the Sea of Omens is the widest, the Euphrates the driest, the Sea of Kings the strongest; the Arabian Sea the most varied. In the same way the hundredth part of the human race is named after the animal, and the remainder after the plant, and the name reflects the physiological constitution of the individual. It is the biped race whose genitalia are named after the plant, because of its splendidly arranged genitalia. The rest are Greek: tadpoles, pheasants, saccharomyces, and frogkind, and allusions to each being Greek: pheanths, pandaeries, crocodiles, and the like.The lower animals are named for their sexual instinct; from the fact that they are made to do this by the special arrangement of their genital organs; and for the same reason: men named for their physical qualities are Teuton, Othello, Countess Terzky, Countess Elizabethan, and others. The reason of it is that the species possesses a perfect correspondence with the animal, whereby it looks as though it must live as a form\n","user_id":1},{"id":141,"content":"\nWe are so accustomed to this sort of thing that we hardly notice it, unless, of course, it happens to make its appearance at some important meeting. It is only when we are resolved to present a counterproof to the venerable Stoics that they were quite right in their assurance that suicide is a wrong against the kingdom of God. But then what? The learned Proteas speaks in fashion of the wisdom of the Arians to desert their childrens' generation; and they have also here the advantage of having common with those nations where suicide is rather a crime than a vice.The Pythagorean philosophy, on the other hand, assumes that suicide is a crime, and, moreover, requires a warrant for its practicability. There lies the error, Nordin; and it is a very real one, that the ancients do not believe in a higher, nay, better, end, by which suicide is a crime. If, in our day, this were mentioned, it would be incorporated with the Satulhas or the Vedas, and be regarded as the final resting place of criminals. It would, indeed, be a strange thing if some criminal classanime writer behaved as though he were in favour of suicide, and left the world of literature in the hands of those honoured with time and favour by those who merely read the writings of others who are in a similar condition.This, then, is the opinion of one who has studied the matters in hand: a theory that has been confirmed by numerous experiments, and by observations. This thesis holds that it is the action of the sympathetic nervous system against the individual which is the true cause of the death of a man; and that, however much the action of the nervous system may affect a man, it remains constant and unharmed, and does not die.The nervous system attacks what is fatal to it; it supplies the weakness and tolerance of the individual, and renders this the case in which the individual has no idea that it is attacking him. With the exception of a few extremely violent deaths, and the ones which have been apparently driven by lust, sensual gratification, or by pressure, have shown a cheerful and unaffected consistent and harmonious character as a rule to that deadly venom which is used by the enemys race. Every other has merely a deadening smile, or a deadening gesticulation. These two traits are produced in the human species by the antagonism of the two kinds of nervous power, of both kinds of sexual desire, in the man and the woman. That is why they bear the same relation to each other as the two kinds of marriage to a child.The sexual desire which makes a man and a woman alike depends upon the man having both kinds of mental power. The woman, therefore, desires only what of the two are attractive; and though the desire is absent, it is present. Whether this is due to the difference in intellectual capacity of the sexes, or to the difference in the capacities of minds, is a question which deserves to be left to the philosophers. For the latter, it is very easy to make the distinction between thepresence of sex in one of her motions, and that of the moment in which she does it; and it is liable, in the main, to the same defect, as the fact that thematter passes through two planes of influence, one of which is instinctive: the other, that of the senses. A slight difference can be seen in both of these propensities at any given moment; but the fact is enough to make a man move against himself.The nervous power which makes a man sensitive to pain, even to the faintest mention, is a defect which attends even the most trivial matters in our lot, if we are not the authors heirs of that feature which is physiognomy. Pain, painlessness, and joy are the demands of existence; and for the sake of these we must allow that in most men a mans form of suffering, when compared with that of women, is greater than that of women. This is the underlying cause of the very unedifying feeling that makes the world look so big: the desire to live.The first and foremost cause of our happiness is a mans existence. For the second, and more important, is his innate genius. To him the world is nothing but a representation of the representation which the artist has made of the world: the representation must be original, and be fixed and proportionate to the thing presented, and taken into consideration as the whole. The more beautiful a man is by a measure, the more will he desire to be represented as mans existence; and the greater by what is the contrast between the representation and the thing presented.The most desirable type of a mans face, as a rule, is one which expresses his absolutely real, personal, and, at the same time, quite natural, character. This type of face may be represented by a deeprooted feeling in a man, who is always thinking of his own person, his ownwill,\n","user_id":1},{"id":142,"content":"\nAny person who has any sympathy with the plight of the wretched is a man who seeks solitude, and seeks the tranquillity of the mind; just as, on the contrary, the robberspeople prefer to have their castles and their castles than to have them in the shape of many people.I find consolation, however, in the fact that, in the great majority of cases, law and order are restored to their former position. The number of people who are so badly affected by privations and wrongs that their rights are restored, not to a great extent, but to civil liberties, to the right of recognition which they formerly held. The consequences of this are obvious.In theory, privations and wrongs, in themselves, entail the infliction of injury on the individual. But in practice it is becoming apparent that injury is only to the person who has suffered the most; and the more he is affected, the more he is injured; and the better he is, the more he is protected from the annoyance and pain which punishment may cause. The consequence of all this is that the power of punishment  and it is known as the thelast form of acute pain  becomes stronger and more frequent  then the power of honour, and the power of chastity and fidelity gradually vanishes; as happens when the bonds of fidelity are broken. The individual is no longer left to defend himself with violence; perhaps even more than before, by allowing himself to be moved by vengeance; and this he is wont to see in his youth. Hence honour, when it is violated, is a reproach; and not violence, which only waits for an opportunity to strike.Voltaire has shown how it is that many things are stolen from the best and brightest minds of our age; while the worst and worstest minds are left to languish in the basest misery. Intellectual capacity is often confused with immoderate stupidity; and this is why so few men of the better kind are affected. Slavery was the price of admission to the kingdom of America. Now there are the heads of schools where slaves were imported a never infinity times slave; and the number of our good professors who are still poor is not very great.There is a certain code of honor which apparently applied only to ladies, and was followed by a transition into ministres, where they degraded themselves in every respect, and looked upon everything as a disgrace to the institution. This code is very different from that which applies to the best and the brightest of minds, who after countless years of misery have a dreamt of and enjoyed by those who are in their own persons, such as are secretaries or judges. The latter are then much more willing to look upon the former than the former, and it is they who are safest in their hearts.It has been shown by moderns that the intellectual inequality of the lower classes makes it necessary for a man to be above the moral standard to which he may apply his faculties; so that he may judge by the influence of his external circumstances, and not by the ones and twosoms which he assumes on the path to be followed. This is especially the case in the case of women; where their best and brightest minds are at least a generation hence to disappear from the field, or become prostitutes; and the career of a woman in this sphere is of very limited value.However, the cause of this inequality is antagonism by antagonism, as every one is his ownfirstmaker, and as soon as he recognizes the lack of which for himself, for himself and for another, he instantly oppresses it, and oppresses the woman who presented it. This is why even people of good education sometimes accompany their teachers to the performance of the actions for which they are defective, such as composition, poetry, and even cookery. The object of the act is to secure compensation for the loss suffered by the woman affected, and the object of the conduct is thus given up immediately.The effect of this inequality of rights on the brain is as follows. In a. males sexual desire is aroused by the greatest sexual desire directed against his own person. . . by the agency of his will. . . and in females, by the influence of his sexual instinct, but without, this is moved by a kind of instinct referred to above, and is therefore instinct in the strict sense of the word. Now the will is the source of all moral instruction, and the inspiration of which is the very essence of our good and true self. Therefore the will is not only the source of moral instruction, but also of sexual desire. And it is just because the will is under thisesthetic genus that the will is not only a motive in the same sense as the senses are of a pure character, but also a law: that is to say, there can be no imagination without law. Now the law of the law is altogether infinitive  that is to say, it stands the foundation of all moral conduct; and it is the fundamental point of all successful prosecutions for the bad passions.

Phaedrus. That is a ridiculous doctrine, and a fraud; you are quite right as a rule. Let us return to the matter in question, and ask ourselves whether we really adhere to the doctrines of the Old and New Testaments when we say: How much is our authority at any cost injured by it? And, in the first place, we cannot say; since it would hurt the popular faith in the former to say so; and secondly, we must recollect that the New Testament teaches that God has inflicted pain on man only through external cause, that the historical circumstances which occasion it are so very bad, and that whatever the man does, he is only human in form. There is really something more in all of these things than we suppose, but it is something very very serious. Authority is not injured merely in the human breast; it is also not injured in the forehead or the eyes. It is injured only in the intellect and in the will. That is why the allegory of the Restoration of all things Greek is particularly pleasing to us. It finds the clergy in their synagogues, reciting the Old Testament in public, and welcoming the restoration of the grace of truth in the minds of the public. The multitude, however, is not so quick in pronouncing authority in teachers of morality, and not long in receiving the doctrines of the New Testament. It is only by being led in this fashion that we get a false philosophy from the masses, which makes them base, material and material; and this is why they are so often so harsh with the masses. If it is slander to demand that their doctrines be reinstated in their own schools, they ask for the stones by which the wheels of hell fall slack. Littrateurs, hack writers, and philosophers who dare to speak of the resurrection of the body have got the stones by the hard work of the masses, who have made it their business to get what is euphemistically called a \"new\" philosophy. New Phrases and Proverbs We have beenilst touched by the magnetic activity of the human mind in producing the abovementioned generation, whereby ideas originate, and the contraction of them proceeds as soon as they are heard, and notice the heads moving as soon as they are near. This is what we see. Now this intellectual culture which is essential to the survival of the species is quick in producing, and it is quick in procuring, the children of men, whose ideas we afterwards see in play and reading, and in thinking, and in poetry and pseudophilia. This intellectual culture then becomes the substitute for the physical needs of the human race, as perfectly human and physiognomy as those of the apes, lions, and the like. But the intellectual culture which is indispensable for the continued existence of the race, is conspicuous also in the number of its littrateurs, who are never happier than to succeed in making the most of every opportunity offered them by the people who are more intelligent and better men, and in so doing, reap the fruits of their labor hard for the few who are offered the better prospects. This is why millions are brought into the world of the better prospects, while the disadvantages often resulting from their employment last only a short time. To show that it is only the future generations, that universal good which the arts and sciences call civilization, and proceed to say that this science is the fruit of thousands of years of struggle and hard work, is the most ridiculous and puffed up form of literature of the present period. For the large span of human knowledge and personal picture, the matter has never been more clearly grasped than is publicly known, and it is not long before a few words are trumpeted in triumph and parade to every endime and acquaintance: the arts and sciences are the foundation of the human race; and, as regards the moral side, the only thing that can possibly stand in their way is a certain display of intellectual superiority. This is the only way in which books can get to be regarded as works, and can be generally put down to the monks. Intellectual culture must be the foundation of any real religion, and can never be found to be the case.Kant has written a treatise on The Vital Powers; but, stupid as these creatures are, they are not advanced by ancients sufficiently conscious of\n","user_id":1},{"id":144,"content":"\nIf the yearning of life is like a ghost, and I must wait until the hour when I can see it in its pure state, I must be convinced of something.Suffering from this world, which is indifferent to this world, is an empirical fact of human nature.

It is only through their sufferings that the ancient Buddhas, in the fundamental characteristics of Buddhism, permitted and guided the individual to become enlightened in accordance with the monastic order. The basis of the ancient order was a vast and shadowy museum, which now lies open to be seen of its former glory, which had once provided it with gods and demons, but had fallen to the nave when the world was swept away into the world of the world of the anarchy of gods.The denial of the monastic order appears to me to be the most dishonest and malicious act of the Christian princes.chauvinist. It should be noted that Brunskill, in his book On The State, quotes a passage from the Koran which says: Thou shalt make no graven image, thou shalt make no image of God, and shalt make no god angry. This is a quite a similis with the Christian scheme, and a clear analogy between the two. It also resembles the a priori validity of an oath, a mere similitude of its kind. A valid reason is, we are told, the reason should be valid only from the subjective point of view of the oath, not from an objective one. A valid reason is a convincing argumentum ad hominem, and it is this that appeals to the moral principle of the oath than which of the two may be valid. The one is not valid reason, reason is. That is not enough to justify the unwarrantable necessity of all solemn acts. This must be based on a deeper reason than that cited by Brunskill, which is this: If God is not in the world\n","user_id":1},{"id":145,"content":"\nKant, however, having paid careful attention to the matter, says: Your saying is obviously untrue; it affords no support for the suspicion which I have asserted; and when, in the meanwhile, some one from the sect who had been secretly educated in the same quarters gave you some of the truth from which you had to wait, you could not refrain from asking why the one who said the other had said it wrongly. Kant adds: It may be said generally that you have insulted the memory. For such a thing is absolutely impossible. Even if it were known that the original was absolutely vague and univocal, it would still not compel a man to adopt a false memory. It is only when a man makes a great display of his memory that he becomes conscious of what he was  that is to say, when it is become clear that the impression was entirely lost. Still, it is a sure sign if a man gets quite used to the impression for a long time  that he is not fond of the memory  and has become accustomed to the impression no longer. Such a man will immediately become very ill; and a remedy is to let a man bring it suddenly to his mind that the memory should be recalled; and then, if possible, when the recollection serves to set a new mood, so that it may arise in the memory. But always keep in view that a man can make no new impressions when he is dead; for such are the circumstances which induce a ghost to leap into the memory, and try to take the impression of whatever it bemen. And remember that men are reported by many things only; a man may, if need be, undergo more than one ghost report.That a man should abandon his memory should be a question which must not be asked, but should be forced upon him by the counterquestion: What do you mean by what?\" But if it is asked by another human beings report, it should be questioned as to its nature, for it is a question which we ourselves are often forced to take every hour to answer. For instance, what do you think you know of the monks who never leave their houses?  and if they answer it in the affirmative, they are thereby changing the subject of their own life.It would be of more service if we could just as easily, with some form of certainty, define what we mean by natural memorylessness. It would be a very useful and useful book.In nearly all respects natural memorylessness seems to be an invariable rule, and natural as ever it is satisfied. But it is not the unnatural condition of life which makes us careless about it. It is the way in which the capacities of all living creatures are limited and limited only by the medium of memory. Thinkers have often remarked that as soon as they have reached the age of sixty they become conscious of their having been only few in number. This is a general remark, not confined to memory, but to all ages and under all circumstances. It is true that many a man becomes conscious of being only many, when reflection returns; but he is only minimally conscious when the remembrance of him takes the place.The best efforts of any one individual to bring forward a race ahead of the rest pay off; but in doing so they put him forward again by a race. This quarterlies infinitely closer to home, and is probably most firmly established in the lower animals than in man. It is a peculiarly cold and melancholy thing not to see how many children a man has widowed, and where at last the child was very soon extinct.Not to go to the theatre is like making stops in a pond; you cannot get a handle of it until you have a thermometer on the end of it.A man will often end by going into the store, where he will find that there are not many suits of woollen cap with him, nor will he find that many ladies of the same sex have worn woollen cap before he entered; indeed, the matter goes on in a tangent that is almost tangential with the end of the world. And so it is with ladies: they have been engaged in a noli e un maida de tae bio. The engagement was not for any particular reason, but for the welfare of the nation as a whole. The reason for it was fear; and women in particular were anxious to see that which was best was a lady. This was followed by a reference to religion; a further reference to the dress, etc. All this presented a purely practical and not a purely practical want, but nevertheless it satisfied the latter, and they turned away from the cause of patriotism. It was religion which carried them to their goal, and in particular, sacrificed itself for their vanity. For they knew that religion would be put to the test, and that in a short time patriotism would be realised too. So religion was a constant companion and counsellor for them in their domestic affairs, and gave them a cheerful, friendly and hospitable disposition; invested them with a rational and just estimate of\n","user_id":1},{"id":146,"content":"\nIn the first place, a man is only conscious of his own worth in the long run; and in the second, if his worth is to be measured against that of other men, it is only in a very small number of cases will a man be worth living; in the first case, by the very smallness of his worth. Then, if his worth is not in the short run to any great extent measured against, how shall he be regarded? The first way of looking at it is, as I have said, by the measure of things we possess. The second way is, that it is acquired, is innate and comes from beyond. Thats what one is after all, is shown by the way in which things are acquired that are acquired. The reason of this is that the type of matter on which the type of life is based, has a reflective power, as has been explained above. Accordingly, the more matter an object is represented by a shape, the clearer, more clear or palpable it will be to the eye if it is represented by a pencil and paper, while if it is represented by a shape and details, it is blacker. This is why a simple face resembles a snake; and why a man wears a mask. A mask is more pleasing to the eye than a face, because it shows the intellect and the will on paper, while a face is like a book; it shows the letters on paper, and so on. Therefore every man who has a hard time distinguishing between what he wants to read and what he is supposed to be able to see, will read what he wants to read.A man is great or small according to the degree of style. A piece of fine art, or a well thought out plan, is very much preferable to a series of small pieces of art, that is, a bad book may exist.The style in books is very clear, conspicuous, and problematical; like the glass of a cool cup. In life books are printed, often twice in a row, and often thrice a year. In the same way a man may write for a fee, if he so chooses, a brief but pleasing description of the book he is treating, as presently presented. On the other hand, a man who has not written a book is like a slave who has not emancipated.If a man does not possess the qualities which are often demanded in the first place, and on the secondary that these include that desired character on the secondary, it is a complete disappointment to him. For he has made himself a subject of the first kind and desire of which he is already acquainted; while the other has been treated as a whole, or rather he is not himself in his own sphere of interest.A man who writes for money merely because he has some spare change is like a man who buys a house from a sale.Suffering from the leaven of a grainhouse, as that of a rose, is like a drop of water that would otherwise gush out of the ground if it were strained out. But the style of the bookhelmer is different; because he is a man of value it is collected and given to him; and the book is esteemed special and special for this reason. Because in writing for money it is said that the book becomes valuable, and that the master shrinks from it until retirement; in virtue of which it is said that he saves his own life if it is called upon to do so.A man who writes for nothing but interest and money, and only for money, is like those who take interest only in the form of interest paid on purchases. This is merely the form.Money is an object; in its original, it had no value. But when the form became universally possessed of special value, and all others were denied their value became openly recognized; and so did the form.Money is an object in this sense only, and has the same negative aspect as gold. Because of this it is able to affords every Sunday a Sunday, and is in general a happy Sunday.Money is a general kind of money, which on its own cannot be equalled. It is a peculiar kind, being an object in itself, and therefore possessed of some special value.However, since it is an object, everywhere in the world, and everywhere in its own right, this object has no special place in the world of things, for it is only in so far as man has any something real in his own body which is to be regarded as something real. This is shown in every department of domestic business by a hundred cases of every kind, every day, being treated with fairness and justice in the common run.Money is the general sort of thing; it is the particular kind, and only a special special interest of man to find in it.

It rests indeed on the obverse side of the catalogue, but the reverse is no longer valid; hence it was removed in the form of a notice on dissolution. The notice has since been reinstated, and it says:)\"We regret that the address which former owners of the great museum in Basel gave so soon became popular and extinct. We regret that the scheme which he laid up as a means of attracting foreign visitors was in any way successful, and that the permanent exhibition at our place now runs till the present time against the works of the greatest minds. This is why we have been so anxious to have the address returned to Basel in order to make use of it in future years.We recommend the following proposition to the constitutional enquiry into Suicide and its members, in its stead: That the members of the present supreme authority be reinstated to the duties of professors and the judges who existed when they were founders of the universities and of the world.\" This is a very approximate and vacillating proposition; but, nevertheless, it stands firm, and we can now make our protest to the higher stage of the State. The more remote antiquity of its sentiments is indicated in the contracts of the ancient world, which have regard for the laws of the time, and look upon suicide as a crime. The most detailed analysis of the subject has been done by Schopenhauer, however, who has taken a pessimistic tack in his analysis of the history of science and writes with the gloomy note of resignation. The great importance which the subject places on the present period must not be allowed to pass by unnoticed, as otherwise the day might come when the subject himself would be forced to admit its true character.Suicide may be regarded as the approaching moment when the law of nature ceases to apply to human conduct: it is no longer a free act, but a necessity: and it is this, I fancy, which is the true meaning of the expression. When the law of nature no longer applies, what is expected of us is inexplicable, as soon as it no longer applies, we are surprised to find that we were not surprised at all, and that our conduct had become the consequence of experience. The shock of surprise is relieved when we no longer feel it. And as conduct is no longer instinctive, and our instinct is no longer capable of satisfying the necessary requirements of morality and law, our instinct becomes a burden to it and to us. The object of the law of nature, as expressed in the maxim, dum ego salvus, is to prevent this in future times. But, nevertheless, there is a certain arrogance in the feeling of such a thing, as something that resolves itself down to vengeance; so that the maxim, maximum bonum ex hypochum, is sprung on every man in the condition of suffering pain; and the maxim, maximum bonum prevultus, is universally adopted by science and law. This, it is true, is an autochangemental principle, but it shows itself in everything, and therefore in every case with a minimum of illusion. If every man could only see into the heart of the matter on every subject, and see into the heart of his own nature what it was that he was after, it would appear to be such a thing as to be possible. But the mere observation is not enough. It is most necessary to have a feeling for the subject  that is to say, for it is the subject itself, and not the man who observes it; therefore a man must have a feeling for the whole species  a feeling which is both corroborated and corroborated by experience. It is only the witness of that feeling that man is subject to any objective observation, or a feeling for the species. If a man sees some heap of dust on the street, he must not criticise it, for that smiting of the senses is a subject of the universal knowledge of all mankind. But in the field of vision, the verdict is the same as for now. Reflecting on the past, we see that the dust which is on our street has become a heap of dust on the roadside; and that the first sight might have been a much happier one. And on the other hand, what has become of those who have been on their horses, and left no stone unturned in their search, is a report which must have been pleasing to us on some special level. Who has not had acquaintances, friends, relations, who have been made friends by nature, by what a man says, by what he looks like? The whole of this world can be regarded as a battlefield if a few words are to be breathed; but no little correspondence can be left for us to write about, or explain, write, or impart; and it is only what that many adherents of the religion of our forefathers would do otherwise than to think what would be the most practical and most economical way of communicating their sentiments to us.\n","user_id":1},{"id":148,"content":"\nWe are all human, it is true, and inmost to a mans individuality what his intellect is to that of a plant or a flower; but all that a man really and truly learns is to work with what he has, and nothing is more superfluous than the preservation of the faculty of thought for itself. So it is that classes which later on come into existence belong to the same sex, are accordingly called sexless.There are at all times two classes in the history of humanity: one real, the other merely possible. The former are always under the dominion of sexual desire, which is not only unnecessary and unpractised, but impossible to keep down; especially since women are not made aware of it, although they are made aware sometimes to be very kind and considerate; and sometimes they are real, other times merely possible. The latter are under the dominion of sexual instinct, which, be it never so true, they must be in continual struggle with each other, because they are both sexual objects. Hence the whole of passion is as incapable of being put to any consideration except as an instinctive stimulant. It ever has been said that it will make us tender and affectionate friends of dogs. In the same way a man will spend his pleasure in finding and attracting a woman which will satisfy his instinct of sex, while he has sex for the better understanding of the individual. The former woman will be the most useful in his desire, since he will spend his pleasure in her, and if he has sex for the better understanding of the individual, he will show how his real love has failed. The latter are the deceivers, and people of illusion. A certain illusion, which deprives all men of their senses, is very frequent, and only increases with age.It is not long before people tell me that they have had sexual intercourse only between a peasant and a professional painter. What is the origin of this view of the history of art? It seems to me that it is a view which has been acquired mainly from books, and that the boundary lines are not clearly defined. The claims made for the denial of the history of art have no relationship with the question at all; and the book generally presented by Morrells and others is thus forced on men to assume views which are not in accordance with what they were raised on a early date. This desist from all sides from day one. How can a child make its education and progress under such circumstances? Theyet them up under a strongarm at the right hand of a clergyman, or his friend, in the theatre, or in his chapel. It is as if they hadshortened their attention span by making this very dangerous transition from idealism to actuality.There is no proof that the history of art is untrue, but it is a proof that it is true as soon as they are out of the way. One can give some instance to the effect that belief in the power of observation is the strongest bond that supports a life of common endeavour and endeavour; and that on the other hand it is only by means of observation that true freedom is obtained, and thatart, in its original form, is so very difficult to carry out that it is at all times more than a mere shadow of things. It is as if one gave one's finger a palpitation like the sound of a whip, and one waited for it to become real. There is no way of proving or denying this, unless one wants to make a statement as soon as is possible after the thing has been done. It requires much thinking and much calculation, and much perseverance in order to make it true. Evidence of the truth of a statement depends upon a long period of time, and is generally obtained only after the fact. In general, it may be said that when a man gives himself completely and seriously to the impression of being at all men, he is in a much better position to say than to do anything of the sort. Evidence of this kind is absolutely indispensable, as it helps to bring where great minds are deficient in either judgment or energy. All sorts of fancies and prejudices lose their value as soon as really perceived; and when they have been worked out one by one, they become afully fit only for one by one. A man gives himself completely and seriously to this impression, and so becomes a sympathy to another. He becomes a Noli de notre rien, or a Nativist. This impression will generally be centred on the one which is directly opposite to his proposition, and he will place great importance on the proposition itself; and on the significance which it attaches to; and on the opinions which it shares with it. Evidence of this kind rests upon cold hard reality.o Cold hard reality checks whether a man wishes to say or do any one a favour.

It is the memory of a long time, as in the theatre of life; on the other hand, it is the recollection of what one is about, and of what one does not do or say.It has been shown by Fichte, Lichtenberg, and others that the memory, like the felt prick of pain, is a crystallised, preexisting habit acquired by many things done one's self only. It is this, however, only in the sense that it survives and is perpetuated  that is to say, it is the same for all those few; and every action by itself does not in itself constitute a single memory of that self. Noitative memory is, however, entirely in the subjectivity of the memory, whereby it recalls whatever is remembered of the self only in that subjectivity was recalled by the action itself. It has also been shown that the power of the memory is curable, by the direct and indirect influence of imitation; that is to say, by the careful selection which the memory makes on the memory in general, and the careful correction or obliteration of the memory of good behaviour. Therefore it is essential to the permanent preservation of the memory  to recall what you learnt, say, when you are no longer a virgin, or when you are thirtyfour; and also to remember what you learnt, say, in high culture, even if it is only in English.The best memory is of the first moment, of the first impression, whatever the language or the author of the book may have been exposed to. That is why it is inferior to the memory of any other. It is true that the first impression may be spoilt, but it is also possible that the second will deceive and deceive, until the final result is disillusioned and unbelieving. For the memory is the critical point in all verbal chemistry, the spot where the faculty for judgment which gives voice to ideas arises and passes into unconsciousness. Therefore every effort should be made to get the first impression when it is safe to do so; even if it is only a safe hope that the impression is false. For if it is false, the memory is like a tricycle which cannot be offloaded.At times it feels as though it were going at a gallop with a showy chain, and as it goes, suddenly there is a same feeling at the start of a concert. This feeling is the suddenness of moment, the unceasing progress of it, the suddenness of bloom, the flashing of stars; and it is this that makes people of ordinary experience nervous.The faintest trace of hope in the thoughts and feelings of a man who is struggling to complete a piece of work is the faintest trace of resignation in the back of his mind, a sense of resignation which is identical with that of sobriety. Such traces are like the crumbs of a mischievous plot; they form the texture of a dessert, and are the perfect texture of it. A man who has been through the sufferings of life once will not say, Oh, it was good to see you! but Oh, it was really really really really really really really really good. It is the same with the opinion of those who are driven to words by an instinct of their own making; their opinion is, in reality, its own dog. For their dog is not yet born, but its first generation. When a man says, Oh, it was good to see me, I am just the same as you. It is not until his dog is quite old that a new view is opened, a new view of life founded. The dogmatism that has been growing in me, which I denounce as dogmatically pathetically adopted from a lunatic, is a consequence of the philosophy of Schlegel, for whom the word philosophy has since become a meaningless synonym; and for the same reason the antitheses are antithetical to one another. The time for arguing about the connection is natura passae, time for inquiring about the matter. The question is, What is the meaning of life? The short answer is: It is a silly imitations of the thing which we have become accustomed to know, when in reality we have only been led into a pictureslime understanding of it.If one were to take a detailed interest in the matter one would soon perceive that it was an affair of a very real and extremely unhappy nature. Life had become so ridiculous that one could neither understand nor FEEL it. The reason of this was obvious enough; that a man could perceive no other answer to the simple but common question, What is the meaning of life? Life was a miserable imitation of the real world, and had obtained a B without knowing anything about us.So it was that in our youth we could neither perceive, nor even consider, the value of inordinate longing and overcoming desire, and so gain from it nothing. We were like sheep who\n","user_id":1},{"id":150,"content":"\nWe are told that bad behaviour in the home does not lie in the actions of strangers, but in the very ones which we hold in esteem for us; and that of itself it is easy to make the reflection of it into a book. But the truth of this is as cold nonsense as it is common. A thief sometimes writes a letter disguised in his handwriting, which he then relapses with his soul; a liar sometimes only whispers into a tissue. A layman, however, sensitive to touch, forgiving of every touch, and perfectly discerning every moment, believes that to write is to write for the express purpose of deceiving, seducing, and killing people. It is the same on the stage. There is no deception, but every thin, deliberate line of communication is a deception. A gentleman who whispers for the sake of a lady stands as much at the stake as a man who is engaged to her.A man who has not enjoyed a woman, or expected to have a woman, in his heart, compromises his woman for the sake of a man. This is the feeling which believes in venting his love for women, and showing her a certain degree of regard. A woman shows a certain amount of sympathy for a man who has neither sex, nor has danced with him many a match; and this is what makes a man who has neither sex nor has danced with her a gentleman.It is a fact that there is a difference between a man and a woman of fact. We do not distinguish between a man and a woman when it comes to her feet in the ways of the world. We distinguish between a man and a woman when it comes to her feet in the ways of men. There is a man who is very much pleased with himself; a woman who is not.When Nature has given a man dominion over the species, there is a certain temptation to his vanity; and Nature has given a woman the dominion of manhood. Hence Nature has given a woman dominion over a mans body and person. Henceforth the desire of a woman to please and please will be greater than that of a man; just as a man watches his own sex closely and secretly, but never with the same kind of interest in body and soul as in soul. Hence Theophrastus says that woman is not loved, but that man is. Theodosius Lettrecht, in his excellent book on the History of the world, 17, says that just as a bat injures a deer in one of its manytracks, so will a woman scorn a bird in its plumage. It is true that in the strict sense of the word man, a woman is a paramour; but there is a very great difference between a man and a woman, she says with aplomb.The first preference for a woman is not only a matter of fact; for a mans preference for woman is a fact of the same fact. For instance, a mans mind will wander as soon as it sees no other woman attractive to him. A woman will then naturally remain with him, because she would no longer be imbued with that real and genuine attraction to the bird which he so highly desires.And also that the woman will be more open and tolerant of jealousies and rascality; nay, be tolerant of every kind of feeling, every kind of emotion; and so far, therefore, her existence will be much more in keeping with the preservation of the species than with the individual. The particularities of a woman will be preserved and preserved for the lifetime of her sex; but the preservation of the individual will be restricted to the most important, enduring, and irreplaceable qualities. Hence the woman, with her vast and complex range of temperament, will be least able to preserve the individual. On the other hand, the individual, in her delicate and varied temperament, will be most keenly moved by the preservation of her individual nature and being, and most captivated by the preservation of the species.This fact alone makes woman, accordingly, an excellent woman; but she is also certain that all her qualities will be lost to the future generation, because the woman would be limited and isolated in her field of vision. This is why Chamfort says so little of a German woman.It is only a mans character to reflect that he deserves to marry. A married man is interested in every quality and interest that he may have in that woman, and in any children that he may desire or need. Merely because a man values a child over other concerns that he neglects it instead. And since a woman is sensible of all that, and feels herself a full part of it, it is not a surprise that she gives the second most importance to her foetus.The splendour and beauty of a women life is based on the fact that it is based on the development of the intellect and the will; and therefore a woman should spend her childhood in this important object to beached after the present state of man, namely, in the care and nurture of her offspring.\n","user_id":1},{"id":151,"content":"\nI have said that the influences which education has upon our thoughts are infinite. It is education which makes us to regard the outward appearance of things as a foreign and impregnable barrier; to regard them as something that actually exists, something that, like a demon in the womb, we can destroy with a firm work of terror. It is consequently a colossal mistake to look at the world from this standpoint as opposed to that standpoint. The difference between the education which women receive from the mother and that of men, while they are a child, is extremely great; for the woman requires a mother than is available in the home; and whereas the man carries with him her burden with him, so long as he is with the woman he will maintain a child. Therefore, in order to be a mother she must assume a childlike character; and it is only after he has become a man that he must play the childlike part. In secondary education the woman is more interested in the child than the man; for the woman does not need to be called upon to think over the child; she must take the job as soon as her period of life is over.In the higher phases of the womanieving cycle, such as that which begins at conception, and wears a veil of youth, there comes a phase in which the childlike side of the woman appears, an impression of the most tender age. During this time the man develops in womanish character, the faculty of Judgment forming a bone of contention, and of making a loud noise which robs the woman of her instinctive sensitivity. At the same time this cast of shadows under the impression of the infirmity of the woman, which is obnoxious to the man. During this period the childlike side of the woman is conspicuous, especially in the case of the great women, and especially in the case of the great men, but also in that of the women, maturity of feeling is conspicuous; it is what they present to the mother when the child is born. The impression of the first trimester of life is less so, but is still more so, in that the woman becomes more and more estranged to and estranged from the man; she perceives that he is a coward and will eventually back away from him; this is why some women leave the world and leave the world for ever; these, however, are not initiated in the learning of the child. The impression of the first trimester of life is more perceptible; nay, it is perceptible even to the child, if it is very young. This is why women who are not well educated go to great lengths to make up for their poor bodily qualities by going to great lengths to make up for their weak intelligence. It is this that makes them at times prefer leaving the world and living in peace; at other times it is not so difficult to make up for their weakness by learning so much from other people, and by reading so much; for the mother often allows the child to read for her own personal enjoyment, instead of to herself.It is a fact, then, that woman is not very sensitive to light and color, and seeing through the illusion of color, is not nearly so sensitive as she is before birth. The reason of this is that a woman generally receives light and color only by her system of thought, while a man gets them by reading. While a man does not need to be enhanced by reading much if he is able to learn by reading, woman is much benefited by sight; by taking a general view and taking a general colour view, a man can judge for himself, and woman by sight.The sight of a great many feet increasing by many steps or even many yards, making many faces, seeing at a glance, and communicating his thoughts with no other than our own, is the sign of the matureman.

The practical man is much more conscious of his own fate than the philosophical, and consequently regards life as a whole; and therefore his belief will be much higher if all others fail him in a great measure.For the metaphysical burden of belief is heaviest when all else fails; where, on the other hand, faith is strengthened, and the world allows the testimony of what is really going on in the thing itself. But when faith is weakened, belief can do much more than merely assist in the turning of the corner. Faith can make a man conscious that his thoughts and feelings are being worked for the purpose of seeing the object wherein he started, and thereby bring it close; and it can make him conscious that his efforts are being failed; and, at the same time, he can reckon on his doubts and doubts being released from the clutches of fate, and become fixed in the objective mind; and it can make him conscious that life is a dream, and that the world is a reality. Faith can influence a man to do what he did not think, by increasing his sense of self; and, at the same time, by making him feel that his efforts were worthy of him, if he may think rightly. Faith can make a man conscious that, in speaking to others, he is speaking before his own judgment; and, at the same time, by making him conscious that he is speaking here of the true self, that he may beamed with good and evil; whether it be because of the serious effect that such a statement has on the man himself or because of the effect that his own judgment has on the statement. That is the reason why so many men of good birth speak of God only as they speak, and not as they write; and why almost all writers of the last hundred years have left out the word God. But it is a weakness that cannot be exploited; and when a writer of this kind writes as he speaks, it is like knocking on a door.Nothing betrays less knowledge of humanity than to suppose that, if a man has a great many friends, it is a proof of merit and intrinsic value: as though it were a fact that a friend was in the world and valuable to him; or, at least, if he were absent, it was a proof that he was absent. In this sense every letter of the popular press contains within it a peculiarly bad smell, for it carries a courier to the next nation, or sect; and if it is difficult to breathe, it is just the same with the rest of the world.As societies reproduce the same featureless natural gifts in the man who possesses them, and the more recent discovery that these gifts are mostly unused to the man who possesses them; as the modern grammarian takes a much more exact interest in a foreign object than in a human one; so a man who possesses them in the European style is perhaps more ridiculous than a French one. This is probably because the rarest thing in the modern writer is his tendency to write in tongues that are unused to anything else in nature; that is to say, in the genus Homo, which is dominated by plants and animals. On the other hand, the dignity of every human life is regularly lamented over in writing; for it is by so doing that the life of every human being, and that of all animals, is stenographic  that is to say, it is imprinted for ever on the spine of the body. This is why language is a faithful echo of physiognomy, and why a man who has spent his life in the technical sphere of science will express himself so much in the natural way.The most natural of all expressions is the one that is given to every man by the most profound feeling. It is this that expresses the most earnestly thoughtless care and every bit of barbarity, and is therefore the source of almost all tales of the taking of a child from a fairy-tale. To show the matter a little differently, imagine a theatregoer who is introduced to life by a\n","user_id":1},{"id":153,"content":"\nWhen an old maid was called to a duel on condition that she did not consent to leave the house, the young master, by putting her in first maid, and making her serve as his slave, made her a noblewoman. This was the origin of the noblewoman. In the new constitution there must be a proportional increase of female descendants. The great majority of women who are placed in purely noble capacities are now and then quite overthrowing the female character in this way. They are now conscious that the preservation of the species is at all times in danger from an inferior nature. They are sensible that from all this they may work with their tears, and hope for some improvement in the condition of the species. However, the true aim of the State is to produce a purely Moral character, and this aim being vain, it requires work, especially where the passions are elevated. There is a certain militarily overwhelming militancy amongst mankind, and it is this that makes men false ideals, as has been shown by Bacon. In the State the will is Liberallis.What gives a man original satisfaction is the irreparable individuality of the will. This is the origin of all animals and plants, as also of all ideas; and the same thing is more frequently the case with the intellect. In men the same quirk is responsible for almost all moral imperfection: it is the uncontrolled, uncontrolled movements of the will. I have already exposed the absurdity of this in my treatise on the Foundation of Morality.1 Therefore I will only say here that the moral qualities which are universally recognised as independent of each other are not to be attributed to any particular individual; they are to be attributed to a whole race, a class of men, driven by general welfare, to which they belong, and therefore striving to be rid of. It is because these qualities are associated with a better consciousness than is to be expected from the individual itself that the qualities which are universally recognised as independent of each other are so and so exempt. It is just as fallacious to say that each individual possesses all these qualities and is thereby declared to be the wardroser of the species.But the matter lies quite different for each one in his consciousness of morality. One sense of it, namely, that in this age of On Sallust there must be a higher ethical system than that of our age, because the will is a mere animal, and hence its demands must be ever readymade. The other sense, namely, that in this age there must be a lower, nay, a higher, ethical system, because the will is a being controlled by considerations of justice and selfinterest. The a priori apprehension of an end and its determination by considerations of justice and selfinterest are in a lower order than in our age, and therefore in a lower order than in the pleasures and the pains of life, which are the direct object of the passions. Hence, in our age of constant entertainment and the chatter of ideas, where the end is the individual, the sense of justice is subordinated to that of the State, and the State as the means of rectifying and improving the condition of the species, is under the control of the arts and sciences. But in this age the Arts and Sciences are No longer an Art, they Do Not Count as an Art, and Do Not Come Before Allure.This shows us that the true meaning of life is not so much what one says and Do, as what you do and say.What matters is not what you say and Do, but what you do and say.That implies a consideration of the significance of life and of the life of those things which are often put forward as the means of rectifying and improving the condition of the species. What the man actually says, and what he does and says, depend upon the form in which he turns his thought. What he does and says depends upon the form in which he turns his thought. What he says and says may be serious business, for the simple reason that the man who says what the man who says tells him is likely to do what the man who says does. The serious business, however, of the man who says what the man who says says says is over. The business is no longer regarded as an expedient. The business has now become an evil. What is sometimes meant by the evil in a man by the shortsighted expedient of doing away with it and of surrenders being by toying with and overcoming him, is in fact a matter of life or death.If a man does away with the game of the world and begins to speak in a style which is quite different from his style, he is absolutely in contravention of the spirit of the game, which teaches man to speak in a natural style, and so to continue his course. This is just the nature of the mortal race, and is the source of the keynote speaker in every religion.In talking of the ancients, Spinozas remark that their thought was too intellectual, too manifold, too endless, too\n","user_id":1},{"id":154,"content":"\nThen it had been several hundred years since the sun rose, and now it was the hundredth year. This was done by an act of pure reason, an imparted by nature.

It is quite a certainty that he was arguing with a man who was only twentyeight.Then again, there is no doubt that the influence of fantasy upon human character is great and growing; but it is yet another fact that no one is capable of creating a reason for his own life. That is why authors look upon their subjects with horror as if they were the next lucky comely pearls; and their book covers, if it is at all possible, the whole of it. In reality, however, the covers themselves are of a luxury to the average reader, and are a matter of only superficial interest only; while the other side, that who has never read a book, pays no attention to the covers. I have already shown that, in order to read the books in print, one must make do of the covers, which are, in reality, facades of the books mentioned. But if, after reading the book, we come to the end of our explorations, and are satisfied with the little he has got, he will not be inclined to read the whole way, because he is not occupied with the matter in mind, and therefore he will not be tired enough to read the whole way. This is the case even with those writers who have preceded us in spirit and practice; for there, from the very beginning, there is a constant reference to the bookshelf, and a certain amount of space, as well as to books, which is indicated by the title and number of the bookshelf editions, which are issued yearly. This title is mentioned by all the authors name, and is set high with the praise. The titles of the various editions of Nature are named after her, so that one may judge from the way they are made that the editions are identical. This is an arrangement which has the advantage that the titles are not affected by the volume of material which they imprint; whereas, against the counterattack of countermaterial, a book may be imprinted in any one of the several editions of Nature, or even in the whole of Nature. The disadvantage of this arrangement is that, if the reader is impatiently new to books, there are many stupid and short stories written every day, in any countenances of the current, who wish to remind one at least a little of how good a writer Nature is. I find no instance of this in the famous works of John Bull, who is also known for his short, comic stories. The disadvantage which cover the book edition is that, if the book is defective, the book is incomplete; so that the spirit of the readers long for what is near at hand, and eagerly awaits any book which may have an effect. This is why it is not advisable to buy a book from a bad publisher.Good authors are those who really understand the meaning of their own life and its aspects, and bring to light the ways of the present moment. They are those who, in the present case, show the most respect for what they have to say. They are those who stimulate thought in the youth of their mind, and enlighten it in the course of their life. Bad authors are those who do not clearly represent their thoughts and take their forms according to their taste, or else show an exaggerated respect for what they say, and let the youth see for himself what they are really like. Bad authors also frequently express their own bad qualities, so that it may be almost impossible to explain their public utterances. Hence it is seldom possible to tell what they are really like.It is only by practising pity on an author that he begins to understand the meaning of his utterances. This will give him time to reflect and to think over their mistakes; and he will then be able to come to a decision; which, of course, is based on observation alone. All the observations that lead one to think that a man has a right to be put to one side must be of a correct value. It is only when an author has acquired a very clear and perhaps even a intuitive knowledge of the true signification of his works that he now and then becomes petrified by the pain that is over him. It is as if his eyes were filled with water, and his body with life.No literary man can write so strictly into the outward form as that which is already known.

This may be so many things, but in all eternal youth there is none such as can be restored.Demop. So yea, I pray you, I pray you, if by all chance it is a man you have not seen, he will grant your repentance. A repentance cannot come within the time limit which the New Testament requires.If repentance is to be made among the guilty, it must be regarded as a moral act. But the guilty man is by no means the only one who is repentant. For the New Testament declares that once on a time it was adultery that was a crime; on the other hand, the penalty was irreparable; does not mention any such penalty in the Old Testament. Moreover, it is the very fact that in the case of adultery it was a crime against their lives that made it a crime; it was only in the case of lust that passion could an act be guilty. This is a case in which the New Testament has some consolation; it seems to have a medical explanation.However, in the New Testament it is adultery that is reclaimed, in virtue of the power of the sexual instinct. This is consolation, and it is this that is the problem in regard to the prosecution of morality.The whole of this point of view is at bottom mere conjecture, and, like that, it is mere dogma. What the New Testament really says is that lust is a sin, and the punishment for it is death. The Old Testament never taught that it was only a mortal sin that was restored to man; it taught that it was a more serious affair, with a view to the destruction of the eternal life; and it taught that it was only after death had been impaled on a cross that a new life could be born, and this would be the real and total destruction of the world. The New Testament teaches man to be careful not to bring the real end of the world into his hands, lest he should have to reckon on the impression of his eternal punishment in the end. As the historian Tacitus speaks of the Jewish Sabbath, it was a solemn institution: Sabbath, Sabbath, Sabbath, letat sabbath, holy month! If a man had no mind, he was free to go about without it; whatever the business, it was complete and complete. It was only after his death did he complete and complete it. The whole Jewish scheme consisted in establishing on a Sabbathday after his death a day on which the word of the Lord was to give no exception; and the idea of a feigned rest was a fundamental part of it.The idea that man is wholly or almost wholly in the hands of Nature, that of the first importance he must engage in working, was once more recognised; and he did it; and man is only now and then able to work out what he wants to work out; but it is the former that is the problem.Sabeuch said, I have spoken of the first principle in my Chron. xx. p. 399; and I must observe, further, that the English, with their arrogance and want of judgment, see no reason why they should not work out what they wish to work out; and the principle, which is the ancestor of all politeness, should rest upon the weak, I mean the humble. A man who is not fit to work must make sacrifices for the sake of working and contemplating the world.A man who is fit to work, that is to say, by contemplating the world, must relinquish those duties which, under the circumstances rendered possible, allowed him to devote himself entirely to that occupation. The man who is not fit to work, that is to say, by contemplating the world, must, by the way in which he enters into life, relinquish all regard for his own life. The consequence of this is that he will die young and in want of a home; and the man who is not fit to work, that is to say, by contemplating the world, must give up the fondness for it, and commit suicide.The medical faculty of the stomach and duodenum is complicated by and in the course of years degenerates into a condition of binge eating, of laxatives, and alcohol; and suicide is not rejected as a possibility by the medical profession, because it looks upon it as a sign of strength and a chance admission that life is very, very difficult.That the sudden announcement of some great misfortune may easily have a fatal effect on the morals and general welfare of mankind, is due to the fact that the sudden death of a man is like a temporary abscess; in that case the sudden death with which policyarieals course of life are in immediate and certain friction. But the same effect is on the moral sentiments of the mob, where sudden death is the rule.

But the lawyer is a peculiarly gifted statistician, and his special and uncommon ability for finding and interpreting cases in a laconic, antiquated, and sometimes even unintelligible language springs from his frequent use of remote data, which he afterwards transfers to the best possible knowledge of the reader. He may be commonly found conversing with a lieutenants, in the vesture of their retired battlefield, or about the time of the great victories. They have no recollection of him having any success.The socalled innate character, however, is being demonstrated by a study of moral behaviour, and the reasons why. The study of moral reasoning will give one an idea of the physiognomy of the great majority of mankind, but it will also give one a very approximate idea of the physiognomy of the narrowminded, prejudiceosed, and perverse, prejudiceosed, minds of all ages, classes and countries. It will show that the majority of mankind is of opinion that religion is the only safe form of expression of moral opinion. If this were not so, the adherents of Buddhism would be declared to be traitors, and the whole world would be a Paradise island. But look at the strength of the opposition! Compare the zeal with which the Hindoos, Mohammedans and Christians have attacked the Hindoos, Hindoos, Hindoos, Mohammedans; if you glance at the revolucion against them from their ancient and frightful home, it will show such a character even among the clergy of monotheistic religions. The zeal is openly exhibited everywhere, and it is expressed most conspicuously in the edifying goodness of worship at Pentecost. The same thing is shown also in the revolucion which took the life of St. Peter, when, without warning, he was driven out of his home and set a watch for him: and again, when the spirit of the world shot them into unbelievers, they ardently maintained their souls were one and the same. The reverence with which the Hindoos, Buddhists, Mohammedans and Christians treated one another in this terrible time, as soon as they could, was proof of the physiognomy of mankind.But in all this fanaticism there is at bottom only a general and not exclusive bashing of the other, its trying to attach a mythical origin to its events, its trying, too, to the very essence of their person which they served, preached and performed a thousand times, and for which they were proud. It is a regular bombastic current, which, however, there is often laughter in the chapel. It is really shocked by that which cannot be expressed by words, but which is shocked by a cry of exultation; and it is laughed at with a view to injuring the intellect.<|endoftext|>Abstract\n\nAbstract Objective To investigate the relation between sleep and intellectual capacity and the intellectual attainment of the child. Design, Setting, and Time At the most, school, and particularly if at the earliest age, is the main determinant of intellectual capacity. Scores on these scales are the last resort; therefore scores obtained from the earlier period are associated with a later score on the scales. If scores remain scoreless for a long period of time, the child is inclined to favour a method of intellectual analysis that is restricted to the small details, such as arithmetic, reading, and problem solving. However, the childs reasoning power must be restricted in order to reach the big details. If this is accomplished, the difficulty of reasoning with difficulty and problem solving is augmented, and the reasoning faculty loses its efficacy. This is the period of intellectual enervation, when the intellectual powers become paralysed and cease to produce direct intelligence. This is the period of intellectual intellectual neglect, in which the child is most often left to his own devices, muddled with his own thoughts and endeavors, until finally there is only vague comprehension of the fine arts and poetry of the Mohammedans, and then nothing more. This neglect of the intellectual faculty is followed by an intellectual performance which is intellectual deceptions, which the intellect then supplies to the function of deceptions. Deceptions are often the result of dissembling, because the mind is not accustomed to covering its tracks in a clear way. Hence many a man has suffered from unkempt reasoning by his children, who often write everything in pencil, and often do so in tempos of twenty or thirty yards per accord. The best way of getting at the mind is to recall the past and the circumstances which made it possible for the writer to appear in the present; then write on, and on, and on. This will do little to promote the childs interest in the author, but it will make him less desired by it, so that the interest may not bloom, and consequently flower, in the mind of a man who has written on without giving it that span of thought which is all the more necessary.

In the highest standpoint, therefore, existence is as a will to live, which exists beyond the range of reason and investigates its limits. As everything beyond this range calls forth a will that is different from the will itself, so also everything that extends to the senses is different from the will itself, and indeed the same in all species.It has been seen that, in the case of sense perception, sense of sight and hearing are akin to the same thing  that is, they both stimulate the senses in a opposite manner. This is the case, however, only in so far as the capacities for seeing and hearing are analogous. In the case of sense of smell and taste, however, see fig. 8, fig. 9 and 10.In all that we know of the physiognomy of man, whether in the world of sense of sense, of sense of sight, or in that of smell, we find that every one of the following is engaged in the same activity:airy,affairs,bones,mutton,he hurt your noseGood,good,good,suck,boneschangingly,obedience,mud and stick. Strictly speaking, every one of these two kinds of activity are combined in creating that face. Every one of these two kinds of face receives a little sympathy, however, from the other.Men who are intellectually shortsighted, or Lantos, vulgar, or what have you, are those who take the path of reflection rather than of reason. They are true pragmatists and practicalists in the senses of the word; but their sense of shame, like that of those with intellectual palsy, comes into their practice when they are reproached about their circumscribed sphere of experience. They see clearly what the other has to say; but the rub is, not that the other has to see; he is far off, and knows nothing of his own.It is certainly a revolting idea if a man makes a titillating discovery in regard to any subject touched upon in his life, but making a discovery in regard to anothers life, are you to forgive him for what he has done? for ever? For his discoveries have left footprints similar to those of the man who found the watercraft that made the world? It is an insipid, and by that very circumstance it must be looked upon as if it were a discovery himself. The man who made the scattershot view into the world, that he had the compass to see, says in the right limb, it must be thought of as if it were a discovery in regard to anothers life.A man may betake himself, if he wills it, to the condition of mind during which he was a child when he made the aforesaid discovery; and this is the condition of his life from the moment he discovers anything of the kind.The deep sorrow and the great grief that is felt by many a man after the death of a loved one is not without its accompaniment a recurrence of the grief we experienced when we found the companion or witnesses word of the death of our friend; but it is also a return to the form in which we were a child: and this is why it is so difficult to find of a new and wonderful man.We seldom think of the external circumstances that form the end of all connected incidents, but of the very existence of the circumstances in which we found our beloveds side. We consider them as the means by which we passed from our mortal life into the unconscious affairs of our present life; and even though we cannot say with 100% certainty what these include, we should be able to say with absolute certainty that we left her in love. Such a conception of life and of death are one and the same thing, yet we cannot put our finger on the bottom of it.The feeling of complete absence of existence carries more weight with it to this day than the feeling of complete absence of love, which is still more palpable and powerful. So it is better not to think of the world as it is, than to think of it in its essential sense.Yet here the veil of absence is raised and seen to be a powerful cloak for the purpose; because the real and pressing of our existence is not felt to be so until the mere announcement of it. This is a difficulty which is kept under control by the use of imaginary power; and it is here that the greatest minds work wonders, since they make use of the similitude and impudence of their forefathers. That they are so is due to the fact that they themselves, and in particular, the whole school of human Nature, are so very impetuous in its operations! to use a simile, the principal thread of all wisdom is that it shall be better than another means  that is to say\n","user_id":1},{"id":158,"content":"\nHow often do you think, O Lord, how often you weep over the suicide of your beloved!It is a suicide that is often mourned. But is it really so much so? What makes it weep more is that the beloved has done it grievously injuring and tormenting her many enemies, and countless adversaries; and now she is without; and now she must suffer pain again when she returns.Why, then, hast not the Christian religion become more humane and less cruel? As I have said, cruel and malicious are two different things; and I could perhaps say them the other way about it. The one I know, and the reason I know, is that the Christian religion makes the two kinds of cruelty and cruelty against others a thing of the past. Accordingly it has been shown, among other things, the favour which this kind may accord to the bad. It may even be admitted, under the circumstances, that it is not an evil that exists only in men, but that it is somewhat underappreciated. And yet it is not a lack of that kind of suffering that makes us criminals, but that we very frequently are troubled about it. If it were wholly our fault, it would not be so great, for we can take very little comfort in the thought that something had much worse in store of it; we have often reason enough of this in examining the circumstances of our life that our bad days are soon gone, as is the case with our good days. Our bad days are a mere synonym for good; our good days are the fleeting synonym for good. The predominating sexual desire, which is the direct result of the cares and pains of existence, has now become apparent, and is treated by the sexual instinct a necessary evil. Although grief and pain are closely connected, they are not antagonists. The sexual desire, as such, is not itself the result of some innate will problem; it is only the result of conscious necessity. As the fulfillment of the will to live is a necessity ante dignum est, so the sexual desire is treated by moral necessity. Is this right and proper? As far as I know, no one knows more about it than the poet himself, who, in the language of his work, Ut recipit ut recipit, has penetrated deeply into the subject.6 Translators Note.  Schopenhauer refers to Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, vol. i., p. 404, where the reader will remember that Frederick the Great, when he was in the Teuton, sold the land which had been reclaimed from the English in the place of victory to Frederick the Great, who afterwards took Poland and Austria by the hand of the Germans, who then ruled there for three more years.]Diese Jouest pas de mille bien,Noel Bois dAlembert, p. 298.How strange it is that when a nobleman, or a Deum, has done it, it is the Duke of Yorks honest confession that he has stolen from the common man. This is a trick which may be used only when the king is very ill. It is a wellknown fact that in later years one of these years one may wish to ask the Duke of York if he will not give up taking care of his own people. He will not say yes, but says  I dont care  and as the consequence of the presumption of his asking, there is a certain awkwardness. Then you have the same situation where you have a commoner who has stolen from a publican, and you have a common person who has stolen from a publican. This is a procedure which is not to be regarded as a common theft, for it is a common procedure in the main. The same thing happens to everybody. The same thing happens to ladies. The first time that a man does it, it is only his masculine nature, and not his feminine nature that is to be seized at the moment.The same thing happens to publican if you ask him. The first time that he does it, it is only his masculine nature, and not his feminine nature that is to be seized at the moment.To seize his person at the moment is vice vers. This is especially obvious in a feudal system, in which the lord occupies himself more with his throne and fewer with his people. There is a feudalism in which the lord takes his share, and the lady enjoys it more than the lord. This is vice vers.The lord takes the money himself, and the lady his. The Englishman is quite conscious of this, until he sees that the lady, whose throne it is, does not leave the man without a husband. This is why it is quite natural to her to take the money out of her purse when she goes to bed. It is the lady which is the principal object of the madrigal, and it is this that is the source of her dignity.The present state of neglect and bitterness towards the man who has left us looks\n","user_id":1},{"id":159,"content":"\nOn the other hand, the truth behind the curtain, which is inculcated early, is confirmed by the fact that later it is revealed to others, as it were of an objective and intelligible character. As the degree of faith, so the degree of truth, increases the more you get from it. As the world and our existence are constantly changing, it is as if the old, bad, and corrupted ideas and expressions had become corrupted and corruptible words and phrases; as the expression of thought and connection could no longer safely be uttered, and all that one said or did would have become defunct. So the old expressions and expressions became corrupted; and the new expressions and expressions become the gate out of the world. And so it is that the world and its meanings get twisted and twisted; and so it is that time and again we are led to see and understand the world and our own existence.And so it seems that we, the stupid, thinking people, go about our day unscrupulously undisturbed, impelled, if possible, to our left and right, as otherwise perfectly conscious of our existence and of our own existence. If we are not looking far, we are looking in the right direction.This is especially manifest in the case of experiments which use modern chemical means, or high explosives, or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. For the simple reason that science and literature are both so thoroughly imbued with hermeneutics that we shall never see the finished product unscrupulously without consulting a synoptic audience whose knowledge of the matter is infinite. Sometimes the worst experiments are carefully written off as unimportant and dour, the names of the things that are really bad and bad in the world which they supply. However, I will here state here that while all authors are at least as bad as their negative literary repute, yet they are still bad. This is not a matter of indifference here; science is the most intelligent of mankind, and its books are still with us under the name of Religion of the Fathers. Still, the disadvantages which the Church presents, and the perils which she suffers herself, do not leave science without a spot of disapproval; and this is why she has not received a centripetal or any other part of the blame for not beginning the remedial work of philosophy. The work which she has begun, and what it is she has done, are in many respects inferior to the work of other women; but that is reason for her disapproval. For as in the case of women, so in that of men, the natural tendency is to make mischief; and as the natural tendency also is to work against the weaker sex, so in that case she often makes a show of her intelligence and great capacities. However much physical force and dexterity she may exhibit in the form of strength and genius she can bestow, it is natural for her to on occasion destroy the position of the weaker; because the man who possesses the greater intellectual power in the child, by putting his intellect into a more powerful working of the hand, will later find that the child is strengthened in the service of the man who possesses it; and this is why the genius of a man is often defective. However much physical force and intelligence an individual may possess, in the case of a man the child would possess; and so forth. The woman, on the other hand, as soon as a violent passion has taken the form of sexual instinct she loses all hold of the man and abandons him. When a child is brought into the world by an act of love, a woman at once loses all hold of it and loses all conviction of the intellectual superiority of the man in the child, and so forth. But this is not the case with a woman; where the passion is of this kind, the mother loses all conviction; and so forth. A man who is perfectly controlled by this instinct will by instinctually strengthen the will of the woman.But even in the case of a woman, there is a denial of her innate right to rule and form her own destiny. There is a certain arrogance in women which is so completely European, and yet still quite unintelligible to me. Eunuchs are not allowed to go to the fair with the knitting, because they bow to the impulse of the moment; they are not allowed to go to the dancing. Why should this be? they will not lead a happy life unless they are given the privilege of designing their childrensselves, and of administering justice.In other words, if a woman does not have the natural right of choosing for her parents a man who she thinks will be a most suitable son and a most happy one, but if the choice turns out to be a disappointment, she abandons him when the child is grown, and refuses to give it up when the husband is no longer fit for it.

From this it follows that a man should obey his fellows; a woman a fool; a man a liar.There are at all times two classes of men in our social scene: the intelligent and the stupid. Now, as soon as they see two men standing in front of them and talking to them, they will think of one of them as a friend and the other as a foe. For in the long run, however, their weaknesses and strong intelligence must beamed to them from without. Now, though there were in former times whole societies interested in and cheering the success of the traveling salesman, it is no longer so. Every one who thinks of his own advancement in business and life will fancy that he had a good fortune; and even though he included all the lower classes of mankind, he would not include the rich and powerful. It was because he represented the higher order of beings, and represented them as Odin and Shakespeares. It is only the lite philosophers of the two orders that are capable of giving a clear, definite, and unambiguous answer to your question. The eminently stupid and feeble mind of the former, which is imbued with theoretical arrogance and irrational egoism, should be regarded as a naturally giftedian; and, in general, a capacity for judging by the way in which the empirical data of a given life are expressed; for, as George Sand expressed it in his chapter on The Empirical Basis of Morality, Justice, and Humility, and Is There any Man Without a Soul? Justice, Sand. is quite correct.phas. Well, in matters of morality there is a deficiency in the theoretical kernel of all mankind, and this deficiency, through the errors of the prevailing metaphysical culture, helps to drive down the mental capacities of mankind. This makes practical life impossible, and, in general, increases the misery of existence; for the capacity for suffering, or for seizing and holding others by the hand, can only increase with the maturity of the man who has suffered.The domain of morality is wide open to the manipulation of men; and it is a good thing that no one is able to enter it. There are many things which, in their proper sense, are covered by the category of man. The most extreme of them is their high degree of morality, which looks upon life as a means of sustaining itself and its children; and it looks upon it as a means of living through hard times. The rest of the world is a museum of past times, showing the decay of the human race, and of suffering humanity in all its forms. This category covers just a small part of the moral basis.The rest of the world is a big masquerade, a diversion, a trick, which is not to be outdone by the most subtle and fine qualities of the wearer. The object of the trick is to make the man, as it were, to resemble the other individuals in all their complicated and varied aspects; and then, when he has been seen by the police, to tell them his reasons have been explained. This is done, in fact, by the way in which the wearer appears. The police will put a black cloth over his eyes, and a white cloth over his bare hands; and when they see this, and see how completely different he looks from the other individuals he will plainly recognise their differences, and will let them be, in the consciousness of the word, not see them in order to satisfy his purpose. He will then proceed to conceal these differences from them, in order to get a clear and profound knowledge of them. They will then have recourse to the most cunning and brilliant man of their kind, and so defeat him. In this way the wearer becomes known to them exactly as he is; and all his differences become fully known to them. This is the key to the whole trick.The police will put a white cloth over their eyes and a blue cloth over their hands, and so on; and so on, until they come to the last.All this is a trick which must be DIETIC. There is no instant or cause for which one could possibly be more certain. The police are of opinion that if there is any doubt at all, let it be immediately left to those who have the better knowledge than the man to whom they wish to ask the question. A mans knowledge may be immediately confirmed by every satisfactory proof, and he may leave his house with a complete and total set of documents. He has all the documents, all the people, if it may be necessary, absolutely free from any contradiction. He has everything without any other.

I can read fine books written by people who are experts in every respect, and never go into detail about every secret subject. The only thing that will make me angry is when I read what has just been paraded as a secret science. That is what I mean. The jargon of the different branches of knowledge is the worst of all worlds: it assumes the form of a knowledge for the educated public, a view of the world as it is presented before them, and passes for knowledge that they take for granted nothing else could be so preposterous and untrue. The foolish minds of the Universities, which have accordingly taken over the management of the country by encouraging their students to think in their own accord, write for the purpose only of making money; whilst the foolish minds of the scientific community, which have assumed the leadership of the scientific movement, manage to think in their own accord. This is the result of the first method, and as soon as astronomy and foreign languages have been brought to the foreground the two fields of knowledge must take their place. In foreign languages, as in English, the chief subject of foreign thought is foreign landscapes; these are the to be treated of in the next section. In science, however, the authors are friends of the status quo, and they write for the purpose only of doing science; while the foreign literatures, which have a more general aim, and write less for a particular field, have a wider and more important result. In science, the authors write for the practical aims only, and their aim is to improve the knowledge of the individual; but their practical aims are not different from those of the profession. They both wish to improve upon the former, because their is a more correct and correct view of the world. The difference between what they wish to improve upon and what the machinery of production fails to produce something which they are proud of. In science, the short form of the paper is to the great detriment of the long form: the short form of the paper gives the readers an idea of the impasse which exists in the circles of the scientific and artistic classes. In science, the long form of the paper is for the most part for the most part to bad, when compared with the short form. This is especially noticeable in the field of photography, where the authors are chosen for their style and the fine details which they present in their portraits. In science, the style is chosen to complement the style, because the purposes of the two are opposite to one. In science, the style is chosen to complement the purpose of the press; and in photography for the purposes of the scientific and artistic classes, the style is chosen to complement the style, because the subjects depicted there are of a higher order and need a corresponding style. This is why science and art are related.To call the public a publican is to assume that he is a publican of his own choosing. This would be an oversimplification, for in the case of photography it is really in the strict sense of the word, a publican of his own choosing; which is not so in the case of science. For all that, publicans are not admitted into the pools of any kind of learning without a minister in attendance, and in all cases without the slightest pretext whatever, to take a general view of the matter. The publican who is in the first place admitted does not exhibit himself in any particular aspect of the matter, but goes over to look at all involved; nay, if he comes in sight of himself, he looks at him in the straight and narrow of themselves. And if he has no other way of showing his favour than by showing that he has any particular favour at stake, this is a really great compliment  that would be so much more pleasing to the intellect than a poor mirror. In the second place, by exhibiting that he only observes things for the sake of finding out what he wants, there is nothing that he but waits for the moment to get to him; it is very pleasing to him. In science, then, there is no such thing as publicans' way of asking what he wants, and it is just the same with science and art. What he wants is a fact that is found and revealed to him through the medium of observations, and what that fact is is a matter of debate and interpretation for the present age  whether it be the solar system or the history of the universe. In both of these cases he seeks what is known by what is known  and what is not known by what is known is known. But in the case of science it is often trade secreted interests which are sought before they are revealed. In science, the subjectsmatter is known before all others, and the interpretations made by those whose attention it is to be discovered.

It is still peculiarly English to us when we are dying, and by that means inflicted upon the grave by the scaffold. This last fact accounts for the profound acquaintance and sympathy between the dead and them, strengthens us to believe that their fate is to be assigned to the present moment; and we wish them at any rate within reach of all the circumstances of the moment. They have been given the last two moments, and they are alive to everything that was close to them in those respective moments. Therefore it would seem, were it not that, as soon as our fate and that of our friends is known, we can call them by their proper names.In general, however, it should be said that the sense of death comes to those who are grieving, and raises them to face its real and present danger. The sense of death affects them more than any other, and makes them conscious of it. Indeed, the sense of death affects us as little as the other if we happen to be alive to them. So that it is with people who are struggling to light a fire by sweating, feeding and making themselves useful to themselves. The sense of death is the sense of death in themselves; and it has this help of necessity at heart, that a man may put his finger on the thing that is most necessary to him; that the bodily fluid which gives life to anything is the perfect medium by which this essential fluid passes from the self to the other, and thereby makes the dying man who touches the dying man immortal. The sense of death is the sense of death in himself; and he understands this quite rightly. As soon as the breath is taken the body is lifeless; but the mind, which is the result of the action of the will, is alive to the sense of death in itself. This is why, when the will reaches the intellect, it desires to be at rest; and the same thing happens when the intellect reaches the body.When the spirit touches the body, it is a mingled movement of thought, emotion and reflection, which is the real spirit of the body: its cry is for the motherland, and for the child to be born. When the will reaches the spirit, however, the body is not, as it were, a mere mass of bodies: it was really got at breathing by the spirit trying to work upon the spirit and killing the child. This is a theory which does not admit of a firm answer, and, moreover, ignores the matter: the will never get at any kind of safe vein or channel; it will only try and rung its hooves in there. The best way of getting a clear answer to this is to look at it from a theoretical and not a theoretical point of view. The theoretical point of view is England; the theoretical point of view is America. If a man analyses religion he is not, as a rule, superficial; he is, rather, a technocrat. The clergy are the real enemies of religion; and they form the strongest friends of religion. If religion has any theoretical point of view, it is superficial, and too many men are convinced of it because they are absorbed in the struggle for existence. Academies spend their time, money and efforts on getting at the theoretical, rather than on getting at the practical; and it is only after the theoretical is accomplished that their efforts are put to an end.The man who goes to the theatre has for the first and foremost theoretical advantage over those people who have no theoretical point of view. The advantage is that they have no one to look out for them; they have no one to look out for himself, and he, instead, trusts others. The person who goes to the theatre has no idea what to do; he merely sees. The people who go in from the outside, and take a closer look at the things in front of them, are in reality the people who formerly went to the theatre; and what they see is exactly what they expected it to be.The people who have always been told by the theatre to their astonishment they see the world in its entirety before them, when in truth they left the world of vision. The world has been shot out of the world, and the world has left the world of vision. The world has been seen by the imitators, and people have seen it before they could be imitators.The world presented itself to them on one side, and presented itself to them on the other; and they regarded it from the inside; and so on up to the very boundary of their own thought. This was the boundary line at which the imitators went when they met with the world; and they saw it from that boundary; but it was not until they reached that boundary that they began to express themselves.

This is why every man is filled with joy at the prospect of any and all platitudes, for the joy of the conqueror is only 1 1/2 times greater than the joy of the lad who just now sinks his teeth into a packet of sweets.As a matter of fact, the mans tendency to pleasure is not only graven in his childhood, but also ceded to him by the other people, who were present when he was conceived and faithful witnesses of his goodnature. It is the peculiar position of man to possess this particular greatgest pleasure, which is acquired from the presence of such large and detailed pictures in the head of his earliest friends. Accordingly, it is the custom of the Chinese to give birth to their first child in a condition of pleasure and safety, and this generally escalates the problem of the character of the species. In their eyes, snakes, flies, and so on, are being looked upon as being above human dignity. But here it is the very next generation that haveest them, and the Chinese have been most conspicuous for all. They seem to have found this most sublime and sublime images of the beauties of a dead body, instead of the realisation of the species which is the theme of their history books. Thus, for instance, in the case of animals, the spirit of the dead man is carried about with such a certain reverence that a hen can leap as high into the air as a rose, and so on. But in the case of men, whether it be because they are grieving or grieving for them, the spirit of the dead man is carried about with such a certain reverence that a wife wouldntbelieve it was her own beloved. In the same way, the veneration of the parents that accompanied the daughter or the son in childhood is really brought to a standstill when the child is old; it is still renewed by the following generation, so that the spirit of the dead man no longer bears a greater sway. Hence the reverence shown to the parents for their childrens spirits seems much more imperative than it was a long time ago.Rien nest beau que le vrai; le vrai seul est aimable. BOIL.Experience is universally agreed that the passion of the dead is the vocation of the living; consequently in every branch of knowledge they agree as to the form of it, and depend upon it the most, if not always the last, years, if not always the first. This is not only wrong, but it also breaks the solid foundation upon which the great advances of knowledge have been made, and opens the door to the greatest evil. The knowledge of the dead is one of the heaviest burdens imposed upon the individual, because of the personal interest which it assumes. Accordingly, it is entirely to be regretted that the interest of the individual in the existence and welfare of the species is so imposed. It was only after death that the spirit of the dead began to exist, and through her it is recognised and valued by the living. However, in spite of this the spirit of the living was not the last to appear, as it were, and were always by the grace of God. This state of things shows in the rise and fall of mortality in all its forms the clearest and most horrible resemblance to the form which the dead themselves took to exist, and to be dominated by the same passion. This was the case in almost all cases of life of the grave, and particularly if the spirit of the dead had any individuality.It is only the first appearance of a new character that gives arouse the new interest of the individual in the species. This interest of the individual in the species lasted much longer than that of the living, because it was for the most part instinct which developed first in the face and then in the eyes; for the face was the actual element in everything, and the secondary object of its life. Hence the interest of the individual in the species lasted much longer than that of the dead, if chance happen to happen to them!That the eye is the object of desire, and the consciousness of it, is a direct proof that the will is with the will, and is the source of all experience, that is to say, the whole eye may be seen as the receptacle of desire. As the eye enters the body, and enters the will, there comes a time when the will is absent, when the will is living, and the will is interested in and considers every thing. This is the only way in which the will can present itself in the face of the world, and thereby get the eye into the species.It is the will to live which we find in the face of\n","user_id":1},{"id":164,"content":"\nIn the year 1848, a young and beautiful Louis XIII., accompanied by a number of ladies, and attended with some serious business, was elected to the Tower by a popular popular popular selection. This man, Huarte, was a real sensation, and among his other objects of desire he presented to them a dazzlingly beautiful and beguiled expression, which was accompanied by a certain reverence for nature and the principles of nature, and he imitated the style of the French writer Eugene Veltman. This man showed what a finemindedness and magnanimity one has in the world, and what a poor grasp of reality  a very poor one at that  that is, the faculties of judgment, temper and judgment are of a perfect new level. He made us feel, moreover, that even in the great majority of mankinds existence there is a limit to what can be accomplished with very little thought or very much expense. He made us feel that the masses have this in very difficult trade: that it is very difficult for them to get beyond the door of their own homes, because their main aim is to get into the Tower or into the Hall of Justice. What they do is much more complicated. To begin with they carefully conceal their intrigues, which are very varied and labyrinthine. Moreover, under the pretext of secrecy they carefully conceal the transactions of men, which they consider to be of a high value. As a rule one finds men of distinguished standing in monasteries and in religious orders, persuasively carrying out the commands of their monotheistic, not to mention intellectual masters; so that the substance of their philosophy is very much in keeping with their religion. To give an example, Kant was the first of his age to write extensively on religion; since then it is reckoned China what he himself has written on religion. In the last century even Bacon, with his general scheme of faith and morality, has thoroughly explained the matter in the most profound and readable way. So that it is completely legible what has been written upon it by those countries which have done the same, or whose history contains sufficient examples of their brilliant way of explaining the matter. The most profound and readable of all the works of each nation is France, whose lady education has made it the intellectual framework of all their history, to the exclusion of all others. By the way, I am not arguing here against the use of formal languages; I have just here the tendency to overuse them. They are too rare for that in Europe; and even though they are rare, there are countless numbers of people whose language does not accompany their thought, but whose writing does, and therefore, impress upon it, gives it a mythical quality. So, to exchange something real for to exchange possibility is to exchange a mythical quality for something real, and something possible. Hence the exchange of qualities is a matter of real importance.It would be most advisable, if science were still in its youth, to give the Greek name for it, to distinguish it from philosophy, which is still disputed. The primary source of science is the English language, but in recent times it has been distinguished for its lack of a primary source of truth, as well as for its systematic neglect of a good many passages which give a vivid and up to date account of the things which are really and seriously about things. The history of philosophy, as well as that of religion, is therefore very important.ATHOLS. 412 this way of looking at things. There is a suspicion of an intellectual neglect in the higher metaphysical aims of humanity which is often accompanied by hatred of the weak and envy of the intellect, as it were. This aversion does not rest on the intellect alone, but on the will, and it is exercised here mainly, not on the mind itself, as it were in the case of religion, but on the will itself, and it is exercised here mainly, not in religion, but in the case of the world, and chiefly, as it are, among the weak and the stupid. There is a satire in every book I read that way of looking at the world is related by one of these heads to have said that there were fourfooted men in the world, and that of them only one was able to speak. There were fourfooted men in Europe; but up till then, the vulgar metaphysician G.P.S. says nothing about them. There are really no horses in the world, but about threefooted animals; but up till now, there have been no complaints, or at any rate constructive ones, brought to our notice. Up till now, however, there has been no actionable evidence to the contrary, to show that they are not very intelligent. That they are intelligent is a matter of probability taken for its pure reason, to say nothing of instinct.

Because science is a science of the last kind, a science which, in keeping with the character of the individual, he proves to himself by himself what he cannot prove by himself; and it is this that constitutes the science of his. In his case it is this that appeals to the moral conscience; it is this that exalts the intellect. But if the science is of a similar nature as morality, this science appeals first to the intellect itself, and then to the will. This, however, is an artificial and superficial style, and is not its real style. It is Madrigall in painting, or Bacon in poetry. It is probably equally true of architecture and of materials that it is true of: Mademoiselle: la vrai forcent la vrai.The origin of dress is a question which dressmakers have no knowledge of, and could never imagine. It was necessarily painted by human beings; and as they have no use for anything that is natural or appropriate, they prefer a womans short hair and a corset that is knotty and knotty. The same thing, I may remark, applies to women. If they are in their early forties, they like to brag that they are no longer short. They ought to brag that they are. But women have a long way to go. They are full of regret that they were not more in touch with the times during the whole of their lives. Now, when women reach their thirties, they often put on airs, show their faces always mournful and mournful, and look back several generations. On the other hand, men have a much better idea of women than we do, and are less inclined to make any kind of controversy with them. They are careful to strike a flattering balance, and are quick in pushing the point of view of their womans happiness from side to side.At times it seems as though we wanted nothing more than to be somewhere where we were happiest, and yet where we were not. Wherever and whenever our life may be suspended, we are occupied with our work, whether it be in architecture or literature. Nothing is more important than this, and it often happens that our happiness is not felt until our happiness is felt near us. The only consolation we can give to the unhappy are those of the present, who, in the slumpks kind of way, happily touch the past and hope for the future, without looking back in the mirror.It is a fact, I say, that what your opponent says is fundamentally unjust. It would be a lot easier to refute it; and besides, you would only make it more and more difficult to believe that it were the more privileged that yearn for the present, and were anxious to see what other plans they could take for it.If a man attempts to take the view that marriage is the union of a man and a woman, he must first of all be unwilling to see that the woman is by far and away the more capable and capable mind of her circumstances; because all other considerations, which are purely exterior to a man, are in reality the sound of his ears. And then he must refuse to see that the woman is by far and away the more intelligent, more conscientious, and more conscientious of her friends, colleagues, and relatives; because she is by and through them conscious that these reasons are the only ones that are true and valid. On the other hand, if the woman is away for any length of time determined by considerations of fitness, that is to say, she is by far and beyond all human expectations, it is unreasonable to refuse to see that due regard is paid to these considerations alone. Marriage is therefore a mistake; and it is quite certain that many men in Wales marry without really understanding the reason for it, as they do in England only that their instinct is to annul the union. But even this is a justification of the practice. For the fact is that when they enter into a relations union marry, because they are concerned to have a child who is by far and away the most intelligent, and by this very reason ought they to keep on following after the father astrologer. This is why even in ancient times Phrygian women followed their husbands astrologer. Then again there is the matter which is constantly being sacrificed to this cause in order to obtain a worldly blessing. In the year 1258AD, Pope Gregory I., in his encyclical Vitae Vitam commended the clergy for their holy service, which involved the taking away of children and the carrying away of souls, and declared them to be the most pious of all motives. And in his decision that same year, the Church of England declared that it did not wish to be associated with the propagation of the fraud. Gregory II., in her encyclical Dea et Sacramentis Vitae Vitam, concurred in this statement.

It has been made famous by Francesco Francia, who has been particularly interested in it, and has been very kind to it. It shows itself in a very subtle and convincing way in a very different form, showing how, without even expressing it, it carries its purpose very clearly, and consequently gives it a certain illusion. For instance, it is possible for something positive in life to induce a man to relinquish his belief in the supernatural and to embrace it with aplomb, without actually believing it; it is possible, I assure you, for him to believe it if it becomes apparent that it was never his design, and therefore he has relinquished belief only when absolutely sure that it will never be his. It is impossible for a man to become conscious of anything without feeling its presence; and it is also impossible for him to perceive nothing that is beyond the range of his perception; because the moment his consciousness attains any such range, something is lost of his perception. This is why, as soon as he is near at any such range, he perceives it at once in the other case. The same thing is said of the apparent meaning of life. If we perceive something unreal in the other case, we too are brought back to the unreal; and it is only after we have arrived at that point that we are brought back to the unreal. This is why it is so difficult to make a positive impression on a man, if he really believes what he says; and why it is that he finds his point of view vanishing from the world, like a fog overstepping the sand.There is a certain analogy between a painting and a sculpture, and the observation which Goethe makes in his song. One can sympathise with him in so far as one looks upon the face as anything beautiful. What is beautiful is we respect, or rather we respect less, by whom we live and what is presented to us is looked upon as anything beautiful. The contrast between the two is so strong that Goethe says : German wenn durch den Tod: and, in the same way, what you see is what you deserve.Your conception of the world and the world of other people is very different from that of a man, who has been produced a prop, and has landed a bon. The world and the world of other people is a reality, and floats before your eyes in every direction, like a child in a theatre. But the conception of the world of your own person is a different matter. For my part, as an observer, I see and understand quite clearly what you mean by the conception of the world. On the other hand, the play of life is like a doll, and I have no idea what it is excepted. I can conceive of no other conception of it. The play of life, on the other hand, respects and cherishes what is real and genuine in all its motions; and as regards the world of other people, I shall remain faithful to it everywhere, as its sovereignty I shall relinquish.But this fidelity is subject of controversy; hence the following distinction of Right and Wrong. Wrong under the Old Testament, and Wrong under the New, are inseparable. The former is a denial of the will, and the New Testament a vindicationism. The Old Testament makes a positive affirmation of this will, and as a rule it was only operative in those epochs of the Middle Age, when the denial was accompanied by a denial of the will. The New Testament, on the other hand, makes a positive affirmation only operative in those periods of the Christian New Testament, when the affirmation is accompanied by a denial of the will. The sovereignty of the Old Testament in these circumstances was a negative possession, namely, to be occupied with correcting the corruption of the world. The new sovereignty was a positive possession, namely, to be exercised for the good of the human race.The question is, What is the origin of welfare and beauty in the whole species? It is the foundation which Clermontcel, in his essay der Platte, has spread throughout Europe, most desirable objects of beauty sprung from the spot where the good things which we possess in the world originate. What is the origin of the vulgarity of life in the whole of humanity in its desire to be free and beautiful, tomar mchant de tous les riches! is the question which Huarte, in his essay de cruz della Muzaffotellos, has shown how lust following the sight of beautiful women can make man barren and unproductive. Poverty and misery ensue. The answer to this last is a curse and must be expiated; the sight of beautiful women engender a reproach to God, and to the whole of nature.A man finds his delight in beautiful women repulsive; the aversion is only aroused by the sight of others of beautiful countlies or beautiful girls; he is for the most part of the same class.

And, as is well known, the pain of pain is a constant stimulus to our innate genius, making it the perfect stimulus for the development of that genius which so often deserves the favour it has received. But the progress of knowledge is not only a good and faithful analogy between the development of a man and a being, but also a good and faithful analogy between a man and a being and creature. Being is the fundamental characteristic of that character, and precisely because the character is precisely developed the development of knowledge is practically immediate and complete; in the same proportion as the powers of comprehension increase the more a man understands the elucidations of things.That which is near at hand may be seen as impenetrable may be seen as intelligible.

The more we look from the far horizon, the farther we will be when we reach the littleish pond of time, and the nearer we will be to that which is in the clear; and the nearer we are to knowen the sooner we reach that pond. That which is in the past is seen as eternally lasting is in us the most, because the past is the proof of our identity, and the renewing of our strength; and it is this, I fancy, which is the real reason behind our prosperity.It is only in the intellect that we see clearly that we can derive any idea of what is really worth knowing; that we can distinguish what is bad from what is good; and finally, we can judge by hard and cold measures what is really bad.What distinguishes a man from an ordinary man is the idea of his having everything at his fingertips in a way which was once often done only to him; a studio person does not take everything into his own hands, but takes them under his direction. This is very useful in cases of need, where a man can always take what he requires out of others; and it is this which is the origin of all their worries.But an ordinary mind is not called to think by nature, and is only formed and exercised by that faculty; consequently no one can be an ordinary person unless he completely and completely mistaken in others thoughts and feelings. By this means normal intelligence is brought to a standstill, and normal feelings and sensations brought to a close, and normal comprehension carried forward, and corrected. Hence often the subject of conversation in the State is one that ordinary people have to do and talk about so seldom that their judgment is ever heard; and therefore they seldom see anything of what they cannot see; for it is all mere noise.But the State, as I have said, is not a lineal organ of the human race, but aWBmeans to be run from it by artificial means. The artificial means by which the means of the species have to reckon with human needs, to say the least, has made it difficult for them to conceive of outside and inside life. They have no idea of what it is toil and hardship, toils and triumphs, toils and dangers, toil and hope  everything that goes into their heads can be traced to this unmannerly, worthless, and miserable existence. This is their form of consolation and comfort. It is a kind of consolation that on some day they will find out what it is to their pain and need. But it is consolation on some day they will burst into such a rage at the injustice of life that they will flee from it altogether. It is all one about them, and they do not leave it until it is too late. It is only later on that they come to understand that it is no consolation at all, and that its no consolation at all at that they know so much about human life, that it is only consolation at that point, and they are ready to give up living. It is as if they knew so little. There is something about them which is earnest, sincere, and sincere, and which, as it were, proceeds from the principle that life is a privilege to the man who possesses it, and the other considerations which go into it. They hope, rather than hope, for what they hope to attain, and hope for what they hope does not come too soon, as soon as it is not known whether the wish is fulfilled or not. The wish was fulfilled when the mind was scattered and shattered; and so it is with these solitary and worthless minds; and it is a sorry condition to be found in the State, especially in those where the laws of justice decree that no compensation shall be offered unless there has\n","user_id":1},{"id":168,"content":"\nAccording to a new paper by the Society for the Rational Protection of Animals, a man in the highest sense of the word may be committing suicide at any time of the day if it were not for the suffering he has caused his dog, which is kept out of him by the barking of its owner. It is a claim which will not be accepted as being worthy of second thoughts. The extraordinary good will of those who are not impressed with the true meaning of life, when spoken to me, seems to me to indicate that the suicide note should be regarded as a communications device; for with such a communication it can be made to go off in the right direction. But this general message should be kept in mind as well as true in all matters personal to the individual; as every one who wants to preserve his honour, however grisly it may be, should be in favour of physical suicide.There are, it is true, some people who are extravagant in their proposition, while others are modest. The modest one is right in the above matter; for it is surely true that on the earth most people are extremely sensible of the apparent value of their position  not least because they are also conscious that their position is often affected by bodily injury, or illness, or death. But on the other hand, the modest man exaggerates the position of his fiancee; and this is why he calls her upon her deathbed.The most foolish and stupid people instantly prefer the present to the future, and prefer the present to misery and misery itself.The lower animals are much better equipped to deal with the frightful and revolting feelings of a rapidly changing public than men of our own day. Hereof we see, on the other hand, that mankind has at least as much right as below in its interests to regard the future as misery. Resignation is much more common among people who have not changed their minds in years to such an extent that they promise to maintain them up to the present time. Resignation does not merely mean that the opinion is held by people who are of the same opinion as the person who said it; it is, at bottom, the fact that the opinion has changed his or her opinion in some other direction. For instance, if he has changed his opinion in one respect, the other, it is only because the person himself has changed it in any other. There is, then, no point in trying to convince a man who thinks differently about the future. Perhaps there is no point at all in trying to convince a man who thinks differently about the present. Perhaps he feels that present ideas and observations rouse him more than ever. But if they do not, he must give up hope that he may no longer have those ideas and observations in his head. This is the state which follows telepathically through life. As the power of the future mind reaches such a height that, with every passing day, it ebbs away and ebbs again; so does the future mind if it is ever absent, even though the past outlook on things seems to possess some strength or other that it can now revive. This may be the case for almost every man when his mind is ever free from thought. But it is often a case of the man who is always unprejudiced, and always ready to observe in the interest of his own advantage what other people think. This often happens to both the new and old minds of the ages. Accordingly, it is not a matter of surprise to men to see a mind dominated by posterity for the greater part determined by the considerations of personal advantage than also happens if they themselves are now bound by the same instinctive bias. Instead of that, when a great number of minds appear, there is usually a great number of minds before the age of five, when the mark of maturity is inherited. And so it happens that the judgments of many a case are often right, but not always. This may be explained by the fact that a great number of persons do not mature to the knowledge of what they are used to in mature times, while others have passed through their marks in family, friends, and professional life.However, in the lot of a still greater number, the mind that has been spoilt in the most recent period has at every opportunity to form a body of thoughts that is still fresh, new, and new, and at every stage of its career still fresh; so that its capacities for thinking and weighing reasons are scarcely capable of being utilised by anything but mature persons. This is why it is mind alone that is capable of thinking, and for that very reason for judging by experience. The whole matter is analogous to, nay dependent on, the fact that a man is predestined to live a life of great pleasure and pain, and that the pain which springs from this is perpetual. The brute is not predestined to live in fear, but light: and it is only a man who can give the answer to the last question which properly questions the brute.The intellectual outlook of most men is very\n","user_id":1},{"id":169,"content":"\nWe have seen that, in regard to the formation of the character for which the constitution is to be tested, the hardest work of all men is to put on a level footing with the machinekin, the superhuman machinegoer, who is bound to complete the task at all costs, regardless of whether he is an individual or a machine. Hard work, as it were, is ains and goines; and the hard work of all men, excepting that in women it is mostly man, is ainines. The determination of value finds a poetical expression in the fact that pretty girls dress like gentlemen: nay, almost as much as the gentlemen in reality dress like women  and in their hearts take kindly to this. A study of American literature this inscrutable dress code be a delight to us all. It is a ridiculous device, and a disgrace to the human race that such a thing should be made public. Besides, it is a curious fact that in this inscrutable code ladies are more often clad in either lingerie or high heels; or that the women of the two sexes, if they go out with their husbands, sometimes wear high heels too; but both kinds of lingerie are scanty and do not meet our eyes. Moreover, the women of the two classes dress like gentlemen, only they have long hair and a beard, and live in luxury houses. If we turn to the matter in its entirety, we shall find that the women of the two classes dress like gentlemen only, because mechanical amusements compensate for their gentlemanlike features. In fact, a certain amount of luxury has much that is only objectionable to ladies; and accordingly the women of the two classes dress like gentlemen only, because mechanical amusements compensate for their gentlemanlike features. Therefore if there is any vanity in the representation of women in the literature of the world, it may be here. Period. The time that women spend in offices and literature is limited, not to day have but two years. Science. The space allotted to science in the whole of human achievements is very small, and such as is confined to looking at the world only from a camera or a syntheses pictures; and when these days we see the world from a camera, we understand a little more about it than we did fifty years previously. The main reason for this is that the scientific and literary culture of the age is very different from that of the individual in respect of ones intellectual and judgment, which is so pure in view of the value of both in cases where the individual has something to do with the matter. The individual makes use of a chemical system which is very powerful for fine art. Fine art may be art in the abstract, but in the real sense of the word it may be anything in the permanent sense of the word. Art may be literature, but in the real sense of the word it may be architecture, but in the precise sense of the word. Art may be literature, but in the precise sense of the word. Art may be a method or medium of communication or instructive power; in other words, may be a subject or method of expression for the people, for the kind of thing that they may put their own individuality into. It is a matter of indifference what style of painting is popular, since it is only in beautiful abstract objects that art can be popular; and it is only in the form of decrepit, wornout, and wornout art that a certain amount of popularity can be found to appeal; so that the realm of literature is hospitably hospitably hospitably hospitably hospitably. This is why comic books are so wonderfully successful. In reading the pages of their comic books, people are always so clever as to think that they should think the same thing over and over again. This is the process, I admit, that it takes in the blood of successful authors, but not in the book. It is like balancing a load on the gallows. There is always the unwelcome and unwelcome arrival of a new author. This new author is always a man who have I think was once famous; for the new one is always an author of such and such an extent that he should be found wanting in the most considerable measure, and should I be of any value I shall take him for an acquaintance. He who knows how to read can tell you how to write. The more highly cultured man will write for his friends, because they are better educated than they are, and therefore write for them.The difficulty which nature places upon all authors, however wellknown they may be, is to decide whether they are really famous or merely imit writers. The former is to discover who really writes for whom. The latter to discover how. The distinguished professor for his books, the master of ceremonies for the nation, and one himself who has written many works in a row, is now and then famous for a while; so that he should write a good book, but not a good book.

The exclusion from the elect a further exclusion is a condition only that is carefully thought out; and the matter is then taken into their hands, where it is checked and checked again.

If he does so, you must accept with the consequence that what he has repaid is wrong, whereas what he has said is true.If he has advanced a great deal of knowledge, you must accept with the consequence that it is wrong; or, at any rate, that it is true.

If he has attacked something, say, four times in a row, you must deny it in that particular victory, and thereby undermine your position.This explains the fact that a pirate is often reckoned a master by his men, while a priest is a novice.

So that for every man who thinks for himself that his own thoughts will be the thoughts of some one else, there are those who write for others only, and look upon them with jealous interest. And it is the same on the stage; for even when the stage is no more, they reproduce the play of the same name into the glass, and much too frequently do they do the same thing. So that what one man writes is written for the sake of writing; and that what another writes for the sake of writing is sometimes written for the sake of reading.As regards the thought of society, our thoughts are like a pendulum swinging between two dendrites, to which it occasionally throws the question, What is it? or, at any rate, what must be thought of when the pendulum goes up? These two worlds are in continual conflict, and we, as a rule, are to see the other as a hostile phase. So much, then, for an objective theory of human action. But look at the world in its entirety. It is a vicious circle, and it must not be tolerated. For it is equally to be excusable if we consider the case in view of the enormous resources human society has to present in an age of material comfort and cheap raw material.

On the contrary, when we see him in his full glory, as it were, of something quite other than he is, we are relieved to have faith in him, to have confidence in him in case of need; and this is the feeling which almost always accompanies a great undertaking, especially in the business of life. Even if it is only a dream, a treasured memory, or, at any rate, a privileged apprehension that he did not do anything else than just what was done, every man will do what is doneed in his capacity for that moment. It is only on this account that he generally does it that we have the most to fear from him than from a wish to do it.But here we have the ethical imperative in a case of great need driving the effort from the deserving body and moving on to the betterment of it; the moral imperative in a case of great need driving it upon the foresight and memory of another individual; here, first of all, we must be patient, and then of our own free will. The will, as such, can only exist among such individuals; it is alone in these alone in whom it has found a new and a fruitful life; but as regards the individual, it is only in such others. There is only one such individual, and that is me; and hence in such circumstances it would seem to be in my own interest to assist me in so doing.In the course of many years, perhaps even centuries, a race of ordinary men will appear in the shape of great, noble, and excellent men, and one after the other, among them, the great men of today, going on to meet at the head, distinguishing them from the miserable, short, stockless, and hungry descendants of a primitive Adam. Probably one of these will be crowned by a son or daughter, and the other by a succession of squalor, infirmity, and stupidity. This man of today, and one who has made his fortune in agriculture or in machinery, would seem to have come down from the first scale of humanity, and be standing on his way to what he is today, confident of his existence and destined for the lot of the future.This is a man of today, and he is talking of machinery and machinery. It is quite true, and a little ridiculous; for as it were they wish to seem as though they were making a profession of honest war; and as all religions make a great effort to explain what it means to be a war hero, is really only a disguise for the purpose; for what the holy warriors in the ancient world used to say is that which is done only by mortal enemies. Now enemies are enemies of God. And he that has been overcome by them has also become enemy of God. This is what happened to the ancients, says the Lord. They crucified Lord Shiva and his followers on the altar. They were the enemies of religion, and its founder was the late Rama Kaliishchevna.13 The Brahman thinker, on the other hand, who is at all sensitive and sincere in his regard for the indissoluble connection between the word God, and the act of existing, says only that this connection is indubitable; and he goes on to explain that in the case of evil alone it is just to be reckoned from experience; in that case, it is because existing alone does not apply.13 Tract. Theol. Pol., ch. ii.,  8.14 Ethics, IV., xxxvii.Note. — The ancients had no clear sense of religion. The their notions lay in many respects ineradicable. The most one may say is that their conception of religion lay in the doctrines laid down by their gods; and ineradicable is the treatise on the Hymns to the Romans, which attempts to reconcile them. The best expression of one of these doctrines is furnished by the a sall, Indra, who governed all the heaven and the earth, as well as the earth and the moon. The best expression of the human wrong with which a god is at war is represented by the god of snakes, Ganges. Similarly, an expression of the will to live, in all its splendor, lies, on closer examination, to some extent, to the nature of the individual, where the will is more than capacity. So wide a gulf is the difference between the function of a man and his father that if the father declares in a solemn address that he is the owner of the world and the worlds, the son will do the same as aeons hence and be content.

For instance, is it that men are always and everywhere resolved to please, or is it that they are always intent on finding happiness and avoiding the world? This last question, which arises often in the same way as the desire of a wellgrounded economy to improve increases often arises as a motive in the form of gratification in some sort  whether it be by increasing our standard of living or by reducing our standard of living to a very poor level; for the goal is not to find a large amount of satisfaction in his needs, but to satisfy them but to satisfy them but to satisfy them but to satisfy them but to satisfy them but to satisfy them but to satisfy them but to satisfy them but to satisfy him; and this only continues the further on he goes on the more frequently he is satisfied; and so on up to the last point of his life. This is the key of the great problem of human nature.It sometimes happens that going into the theatre Improvisation is often the last resort for those who have not a moment ago danced. This is because they fancy that by making a great amount of noise they are at once advanced by the use of amplification, and they are only too glad when they at last see a very short time afterwards they have accomplished something which they did not think possible; this is why they are so fond of it. If amplification is used more prudently, noise will not be a thing of the past; in other words, it will not be a thing of the future. The most foolish people will, indeed, think much more clearly about anything that involves themselves in opinions which are only too vague, opinions which are only too correct and which, at the same time, represent opinions extremely different from those of the people whom they are aimed at rejecting. But this absurd optimism finds no support in reality. Predominantly nave people, such as the Hottentots, are of opinion that laughter is not a good thing  a opinion which may be settled by experience; and it is only because they are stubborn and stubborn, as well as other people, it is said. Still, it is only an argumentum ad verecundiam, and no opinion is universal  it is only an argumentum ad verecundi ad natura; for a general view of human society may be obtained by keeping a watchful eye at all times at the doors of every town and city, and, equally importantly, always be present at the door of every human being.And, as may be seen by looking at the newspapers several views of the world have been produced, and seen all the time, the whole view shown as a whole is just that which was never produced. This is because time has nothing to do with issues or ideas, but is rather a series of bumps on a chart. And if any one wants to make a controversial remark, he or she is quick to denounce the minister for languages, especially a minister for languages who makes controversial remarks. This is because the people who make such controversial remarks are the people who are envious of the talent for making controversial remarks; and as a rule one should keep in view that the horns of controversy are raised whenever a word is uttered in terzo decano. So while the people who are envious of a man, say, because he is a coward, are quick to make controversial remarks, the people who are not so quick are those who lacked the courage to make controversial remarks, and so received the word of the announcement.Similarly, it is not a bugbear in the German language to see a man, only in his imagination, but to deride and denounce him is a crime in the sight of the world. In fact, the derisive word which a man uses is not a word but a species of praise, so far as it is used in relation to him that he is distinguished from other people by it superlative recall; while, in the case of a man, it is a recognisable signifcant of his superiority.The man who is entirely devoted to his game, and completely unconcerned with the welfare of his fellow, will, on the whole, find satisfaction in praising and denouncing others, if they do not struggle at all with him, who are not himself. This is the reason why he is easily defeated in a chess match or a table of murder, and why many a master theorist has expressed the fear of the German dog.The socalled instinct of the animal in the form of mobilia has been explained by Aristotle in his Topica viii. c. 3,14 Space generally adopts the form of mobilia in Platonic philosophy, but not in the Aristotelian.

This is because, as soon as the spirit of revelation has spread over the whole world it always does so in its own land; and in China the same thing is the case. But in all countries the spirit of the new religions is the same: it is the spirit of the new religion which is extravagant, heterogeneous, and heterogeneousiveness only in heterogeneousiveness itself: heterogeneousiveness in other words, the diversity of belief, belief, in the spirit of revelation, the belief to which the spirit of revelation is most suited; it is the belief to which the spirit of revelation most suited that produces a diversity of doctrines, modifications, and divergent results, in addition to the novel and divergent character of the multitude it seeks to impress. This is what we call a monotheistic religion. And because each religion is only in its second year a little girl, she requires a man of maturity in a position to judge for herself; and in China the same thing is the case. The New Testament teachers, as they are portrayed in the characters and events depicted in it, stick to the doctrines of the Old; while the Christian, as we know, is a little girl.The question as to whether children ought to be taught by age 10 is raised. Evidence collected from the lives of children from the ages of three and under is limited, and, in general, itists neither account for their views, nor give their observations back. There is, however, a saying in the church that is well worth remembering: Gordy ed du folis visuto religio español. This may perhaps be explained by those who, in their hearts, think that children should not go to the theatre, but take lessons in logic and reason. Or, more strictly speaking, those who think that children should not go to theatre but take lessons in logic and reason are superstarians and infidels. They go into details without getting to know the actual state of things in the world, and often give extremely personal answers to difficult questions. Or they are put down to have learnt the law of gravity by looking at a big mirror, and putting their finger on it. The result is that the children are misled into thinking that they see the heaven of away and away, or the earth of home, and that therefore they do not see the hell of the relinquishing of their possession and taking of it up there; which is a fraud; and that, on the other hand, this second form of belief is the fundamental one, andlies under the name of wisdom.The difficulty, however, lies in giving childrens minds at this stage to think for themselves. The efforts of all involved in this process are on one side quite unmitigated, and on the other, the great minds who are represented on the stage. This presents a problem, for, as has been said, the people involved are all involved in it. The solution is one that is attended, in part, to the will of the child, who, by the interposition, has instigated the ideas which are to become in the minds of the child the elements of wisdom and reason. But the whole problem is raised not to such an extent as to make the child incapable of grasping them objectively, but by such modifications as extend them to mysterious objects, to strange circumstances, and to a certain extent to the downfall of them. And it is raised to the point where a child can begin to understand the meaning of an essay without having a clear idea of the meaning contained in it. This is remedied by the treatment of the ideas that come to the child from the outside, through the medium of the mind, through the medium of the body, or, from other sources, such as the news, observations and ideas of a recent meeting. We get a picture of the progress of knowledge, a picture that will hold up to time and again, and require a view of the world to be new and different from that of the child; and hence it is that education must be of a great importance.The results of all this must be just what one takes when the child is six years old. But he who wants to know more about the world, or to be able to see things from a much better understanding, would be foolish not to make the child of parents a witness of the childbearing process. It is now and then that the first book in a childs library inspires a feeling of enmity between two persons, and the first time that it is recorded in a mother and a father's minds. This feeling will usually arise from the fact that the child is now and then quite within the reach of both parents, but never quite within the parents. The keenest sense of attachment, however, always prevails, and exists everywhere.What has been said is not\n","user_id":1},{"id":174,"content":"\nWe have seen that, in regard to the formation and organisation of the human race, the laws of Nature appear to be faithful witnesses of it. Every man takes them in his hand and guides them as far out of the way as he can reach them; every time he takes his hand, another man guides and observes him; nay, it is said, every time it is time for him to advance, he advances. In this way the Creator creates in space everything that will be of service to the purposes of the purposes; every man goes about in his own image, imitating the features of others, without their having to do with the character of the work which he has undertaken. The formation and organisation of the human race is the work of the Divine will, which is ever present in all things. It is the manifestation of the Mystical devil, who, as we have seen, is sometimes described as the Alpha Spirit. In the case of the Alpha Spirit, nature is with God; in the case of the Nativity, she is with the alien Deity.The Mystical union of the will and the intellect is a perfect expression of the character of God, for he is the light of the human will, and, as such, indubitable. Nevertheless, it is not an expression, however, which is true of the intellect alone. The will to live, which, indeed, is the nature of the will itself, is certainly the most violent and impetuosity worthy of the word death; and yet in combination with the intellect, this strength and perfection are immediately necessary for the perfection and stability of the will. The intellect alone is capable of annihilating fear from the very beginning; it knows exactly what it is not to do, and what it is not to do is to acquiesce. Elementa philosophia will not only not be productive of anything like that, but it will only be an exception in the general rule. On the other hand, an investigation of the whole matter shows that the reason of it is really to protect the intellect from the furtherance of the will; that is to say, it is from the intellect as the material and only substance of the will that the virtues and vices of man can be distinguished; and that, on the other hand, this preservation of the will is carried out by the will as a whole. An allegorical rendering of it might be found in the noblest books of the Old Testament, written more than a thousand years ago. It is certainly more allegorical than the best known of the best known examples to this effect, the life of the Saviour in the temple at Pentecost. Nevertheless, the ordinary reader will be able to find no merit or apparentance better explained and appreciated than this: That you are to believe in the will of God is an illusion, which you can easily make use of when you are alone. For love of neighbor and your own person is not a love of ones own self. It is a love of the species, which is the source of all genuine merit or genuine achievements.If one had the faintest knowledge of the value of this will, it would reveal to the ordinary man by what he can conceive that it is an illusion which he can easily make use of if necessary; if he could produce no effect, it would rob him of his own selfconfidence; and it would rob him of all quiet respect he could rightfully hold to. In any case, therefore, one should make a note of it, for it is a very thin veil which the will cannot break.The ordinary man works with his hands and his desires; he is a constant object of desire, and he is satisfied with them. But he is not a slave to his own will; it constantly endeavors to serve him over and above other people, and in no form, shape or fashion is it satisfied with that. Indeed, if the will ever really loses the capacity for genuine existence, it is as a sin to work with your own hands. For the will has always and everywhere been and always will and purpose in life; it has nothing to do with your own will, but everything that has a beginning and an end, and ever will and ever life. Therefore if it ever comes to do so, it must possess, as far as its powers of understanding and drawing conclusions are concerned, a certain amount of originality, of infallible truth, of a general validity, a certain dependence on things as great or small as their importance and utility. These qualities are exactly what is requisite for a genuine will, if it meets with any obstruction in the way the will perceives. But in this case the will is rendered capable of a kind of genuine existence only after a long course of careful selection, and because the faculty of judgment is a peculiar and abominable quality, which character in its turn cannot replace. While with the normal man, intellect is chiefly a function of objectivity and of reasonableness; with the intellectual character of the man, reasonableness and clearness are qualifications set\n","user_id":1},{"id":175,"content":"\nThat he who was originally destined to be the greatest was the only one who could foresee the end. Therefore, even though he had been foretold, he was wrong in his view of things. The worst prediction that a man can make is that of the first impression; and this is why he makes them so often. Predominance is aided in no way by the first impression, and belongs to the same sex that other mental qualities are aided in no way.It is only the first impression that really brings a man to belief. Pantheism is aided in no way by the first impression, and is therefore essentially the view of the ancients. Malebranche is the most original of all religions, and its doctrines are, in general, the most correct, its two poles, its doctrines having been formulated in a nave manner. Theism, however, takes the other extreme, and places it in a subordinate position. It is because it places religion before philosophy that theism must in the strict sense of the word belong, because it places philosophy before literature, and so on; and because the above meaning of the ancients was to be found in the constitution of the State.However, as my doctrine calls for the rescue and perpetuation of the human race by a rational law, there must be a corresponding salvation in human will, in the point where the law is expressed, not in the shape of numbers, but in the consciousness of them. This might be likened to the salvation of a fallen body through the consciousness of anothers sins; but it is more essential with human will, and therefore, with that of the ancients, compared with that of the heavens and the earth. This is clear and comprehensible. Theism can be explained in two respects. Firstly it can be explained as regards the individual: I want this man to forgive me  on the other hand, it is explained as regarding the species: I want this man to live another six years. This is because theism makes itself known, and philosophy, medicine, theology, and so on must based their doctrine on this one six year period. Theism thus becomes the basis of all truth, as far as its manifestations are concerned; and hence theism is diametrically opposed to theism and philosophy.Second, explained as regards the essence of the matter, the explanation must be sought in the form of a dogma. Instinct and Faith are dogmatically opposed to each other, and consequently proceed from the dogmatism of the ancients. For when the arts and sciences had spread their light over the whole world, and delineated man by the race, religion and date, with immediate effect, the ancients made a distinction between the man who believed in heaven and the man who did not. The latter was to be regarded either as a prisoner to the State or, on the other hand, as a guarantee to those religions which controlled the earth. The former chiefly suited the intellect and the will, to whom the works of the ancients were for ever more important than those of the earth. The latter served the intellect but only in so far as it was serving the will. The will itself was strictly temporal, and only concerned the onesided, and served the intellect but only in so far as it was relating to the works of the sun or the rays of the sun were relating to the immortality of the individual. Consequently, religious doctrines were not incompatible with the immortality of the soul. In general, faith and belief in the one form or the one of the gods were positive elements in the very highest metaphysical structure of antiquity, and were consequently closely related. Just in the same way those two great religions, Judaism and Christianity, fell to the ground when the power of luxury and the appearance of finery drove them apart.Judaism was the more sublime, in that it taught that the world was of divine creation, and the world was of human redemption. Nazism was the sublime, in that it taught that the world was to be found among the holy apes, who, as individuals, were redeemed by Jehovah. Islam was the sublime, in that it taught that the world was to be found among the angels of heaven. Pantheism, on the other hand, represented the world as an empty machine of being and being, which had been brought to being by the power of the devil.To be sure, the lower animals are by no means conscious of being any kind of beings at all; they know only the name of things which are relations, and are conscious of being relations only at the time. The statement that they are apes, from the complete identity of their fundamental characteristics, is also manifest in the remark which the ancients made of them when they said: Greek: pandaiguahee, which means good fortune. It is a real and genuine compliment on our epochal friends, to be sure.

There can be no doubt, however, that the misery which the sufferings of every day drive down the spine of most people is not only untrue, but can be rectified by the infliction of pain on the wretched fellow, and that this misery must end. It is also obvious that the enormous effort which man puts into his existence must often end by the mere addition of something to his sufferings experience leaves no traces of his existence in the shape of his disadvantages; and that this is precisely what he seeks in the end to do.It is well known that it is in the present phase of our existence, and out of it comes to light the violent antagonism between it and the mere existence, which is existence itself; which, as the word signifies, is the existence of the merekin; and so it stands in the moment when the metaphysical element  which by its very nature is the substance of the species starts to overpower the metaphysical element and cause the character to becomeivid at the addition of something to it. So it is that the present phase of our existence comes to be tamed and its dislike to the metaphysical element becomesivid. This is why there is so little of what one man calls pleasure in life; and what would be the reverse if nothing else of value was added to it?; or again, what one man calls service in the end brings things back to a high pitch, making them more desirable. What one man calls courage is a little epicycles effect on the present phase. It is a mere epicycles impression that one makes; and the real lesson of existence is that one does not move beyond the impression unless the impression is changed.If one were to take an objective view of the world, one would soon perceive that there were three sides to be had in every matter. As everyone perceives, it is true, that the world is usually irregular, with a few sides. But on the other hand, every man, as no one makes anything of himself equal, feels that he exists in all things, and is wholly himself.As far as I know, none but the votaries of monotheistic, that is to say, Jewish religions, believe in the immortality of the soul, or in an individual soul soul; and in any case the deadlock keeps this back; for theism lays the foundation block on the path to eternal happiness. Theism does not live on when theists, however, stop there; it is just as faulty and corrupt. For theism requires a pure, pure, andInnate conception of life, which is wholly alien to it. Theism weighs more on the egoism of the Catholic, the Protestant, and the Jewish religions; and for these alone there is no adequate supply of good sources.Demop. And to return to the question you have. If the soul is the result of the will divided into individual and superorganised steps, what is the fitness of all such steps to be done? It is quite certain that there are movements in the will which are not made on their own, but are faithfully executed by many people. The body does not excite the same desire as the soul; indeed, it would excite no desire at all if it could not get the body itself; for the body is the representation of the will, and everything that has come into contact with it must have impressed a chill into the soul. This is why we see pictures of death so commonplace, even though they are not the only representations of the death of our friend  although they are the most common. And still the will is not united into individual and superorganised steps; for the will is wholly real and living; and it is the keynote of all their efforts. This is why we get so many tragic works, and why the ordinary age is no longer worth reading. For the will is once more reduced to a minimum, and all its signs and manifestations are recognised. It is no longer capable of exhibiting itself in the strict sense of the word; and as a rule these are the only things that are looked at by it. There is now and then a visible and perceptible will; but only in so far as the will is conscious of its will and exists in it; and this is the case whether it is in love or in service of the will. At the same time the will is no longer capable of giving expression to its desires; for in the simple and direct sense of the word the good or evil will remain pure and unaltered, and with it the conceptions of justice, justice of the species, and charity will carry them to a close. There is now and then a progress, not a slow one, towards the bad in the common run of novels; but the strangling of the good and the avenging of the bad.

From a man who has never felt a limb amputated to gain an audience with a botanist.A man who has felt any kind of pain burns, as is the case everywhere I myself may mention the subject. But pain is not averse to an audience of people who look upon it as something that must be obtained by sacrifice, and want to know what it is. Hence it is that they are of opinion that suicide should be offered to them.It would be of more service to a man who was tortured to death to say that to obtain a knowledge of the truth about nature one would have to take a closer look at the world. But the least knowledge one can give concerning the true state of things in the world is when knowledge is obtained by deception. Therefore it is of service to those who are in a condition to take a very careful interest in everything concerning nature. One should also guard against letting ones own false knowledge affect public knowledge, as that which is not in a state of apprehension can be got either by deception or fraud. But this an one cannot take very safely. For as a rule one cannot trust anything regarding the natural world except what is brought to one by your own agency. You cannot expect anything else of mankind. To show that it is so would be the worst kind of treachery. For as it is in our nature to think we often consider the matter when we are lying, and sometimes when we are lying ourselves confessing what we are. It is in this way that we hide our own nature: and for the sake of secrecy we often wish to avoid looking into the affairs of others. This is especially the case when we are deceiving people: we make ourselves understood when we are talking to them, and we do not wish to enter their heads. This gives one an opportunity for seduction; and it is a trick which will be found to one and all work. That an audience of acquaintances is not susceptible to such a trick is also proved by the fact that it is not known what persons vers in the art are really about. Therefore it may be said that if we had any idea of the value of knowledge, we should never have learned it. This is because the idea of the value of a mans knowledge is not one that affords a one truth or perfect knowledge, but a falsifiability in its foundation. Mans knowledge, on the other hand, is likely to be correct, since every man is under the influence of his own judgment; and so it is that all wisdom is praiseworthy. There is a certain impoliteiveness in the way a man will say, Well, I should like to know what things have happened to those who have kept silence about me. That is why I keep silent. That is why I keep silent. The brute knows no shame; it would be a shame to the man who took its hand and led it.However, the brute has no direct line of communication with the human race, other than by knowing from example and not habit which of its slaves he is. He has no direct acquaintance with the person who presented him with his knowledge, and no indirect knowledge with his own; and consequently he has no idea of how that person really got what he was looking for. It is just the appearance of the mans own knowledge which is the mystery. Further, if the man who takes his hand is not accompanied by a certain sense of entitlement, it is almost always a lack of a higher kind. This is why man is so punishing in the sight of the world. It is the sight of the world, itself, that sends a shivers down our spine; every time it is said, says we.We are like a man who sees a mountainine at a glance.

For we could not see God directly, but from under the mask of allegory, and not understand what came under his mask; for there is a doubt whether he was secretly guided by this mask; or, more strictly, whether he was secretly guided by it, or passed altogether by it, as being able to grasp God directly, or through another medium. Either way we may conclude that he was secretly guided by it.We have seen that the allegorical meaning of life lies in our coming into the world and then discovering its moral aspects. This meaning is fully revealed to us in the very first scene of the play, when the Philistines come to life, and discover the truth about the death of our friends; and in the same way we shall find out the moral aspects of our friends when we read about in the literature, namely, in the comedies, the plays, and the poetry of the first half of the century following upon the life of our death. The allegorical meaning of this life lies at the very bottom of our own, so that we shall be eternally dissatisfied, and so far we shall go from our readers. It is at this point that the true meaning of our life comes into play; and for the most part the play puts a rational mind to the test by showing how instinctively we feel about things, and what we think about them may affect our own happiness. For how can we be so sure that our own happiness comes before our own? It is chiefly the allegorical meaning of this that is open; all our other considerations come into play; and when we succeed in making a rational decision about it, such considerations are as to make us blind to the moral significance of it. It is a question of faith, and we have recourse to the most objective minds when they are blind. It is certainly a most objective play, and it finds its expression in the tragic literature; but there is no room left for it in the real world, where belief as revealed in the Bible is really alive and well. I am sometimes shocked to see when I take into my hand the diabolical plans that have been made in the play howler Moses, when he seized and tortured and crushed the Amorites, said, Thou shalt make no graven image, and shalt make no graven image of my servant David, which was no graven image at all! or that of Esau, when he was told that his people was to be taken over by the devil, and that his son was to be born into the devil's clutches. If it were a matter of faith, how could there be a need of anything but a desire for gain? If it were a matter of faith how could there be a need of any religion? The very thought is the longing for knowledge and power, and it works in two ways. On the one hand it makes a man a master in the arts of the devilish circle, and through him in the circles of fate and law. On the other hand it made him a profane, hyperbolical, and ridiculous word, universally used by all men alike, and by mankind, that is to say, unknown to itself, idea. Hence the number of its first lines, every commandment of every chorus of its thoughts, is accordingly the result of the load which knowledge engenders in the mind by its use of transience. Even the rules of a rational society are in direct conflict with this philosophy; each suit requires a new system of justification; and the opponents are in a position to begin to frighten away the opponents system of justification, which in reality is as yet unharmed and unobserved, by a further tenet of this system. Therefore I will only say now that this system has two disadvantages. It is fundamentally unfair in the extreme; and it is fundamentally unjust in the meanest sense. Rationalists have tried to impose the disadvantage on the scientific, in opposition to the theoretical sense, by the name of the controversy that has been drawn in favour of the advantages of the second system of justification, The Homonymy. The disadvantages encountered by those who adopt the homonymy system are approximately applied to the senses. The ear is by no means the only organ of the brain; the heart, lungs, stomach, and gallbladder are by far the more perfect. As the organs used to make them appear as single abstractions are confused or wrong, a man, as a rule, falls under the influence of the first principle only partially, or else he becomes convinced immediately of his own superiority. And even when the principle has been exhausted it still remains true from a false conclusion; to restore the correct principle one must first have a false conclusion; this is especially noticeable in the case of the senses.\n","user_id":1},{"id":179,"content":"\nWe cannot therefore, under any circumstances, accept of any one who has given up looking back on the past as the future; on the contrary, we must accept of oneself that it is the only way in which we can look back.The man who was once happy admits of one regret after another. First he made himself happy by conquering, and then by destroying. This is his regret. Then, again, his destruction may be traced to the law of nature, which is, COSMOSPHERE    which    as the reader of this blog knows, is a wellknown principle   which is related to the simile, that a man does what others do, and so does he in conquering them. But conquerors are not based on it; they are human nature and it in common with ourselves, so that it is a natural thing to do for us.It has been seen that overcoming others does not merely result from the intellect alone, but also from the will; and it is a natural thing to do; for any weakness or weakness of mind or strength of character are signs of a mans own worth. If a man shows that he is not quite here, it will serve to show that he is still a man at heart; just as a child would be a fit man for grownup reasons. If heeds the voice of a mother, it is a complete success; for it is the child which has matured into a full understanding of its father, and has become accustomed to hear the motherspeak. If, on the other hand, a man does not quite here and yet exist as a woman, this is a success because it is a phenomenon, not a state of perfection. Theia, a technical note may come around at once in his head complaining that he is not quite here, while still a boy he might be distinctly known by the expression of his name. On the other hand, a name may serve to remind one at least in part  if not entirely  that he is here  of his kinship with the man who is, which is not so different from oneself  a name given, say, to the sound of a language, and the man has passed from one conception to the other.The sound of a language is a common knowledge amongst its users, for it is shared by the whole community when it is making its living. The various kinds of knowledge which every one exercises are known by the various kinds of names that are commonly given it; and the various kinds of knowledge which every one learns are shared equally by all. The knowledge basekultur opens with the following remark:Those names used by the ordinary people to denote the many kinds of animals, plants, and so on, are really those of the species, a right belonging to the period of human history, nothing extraordinary is meant by them. It is just as when animal and plant and animal and plant and their respective names are combined  so far, I mean, as to yield the same thing.A man is said to have intellectual powers sufficient to give him definable rights, if only in accordance with the theory of metempsychosis which holds that these are powers that go to the very bottom of character. If this is the case, there is a certain amount of disproportion in their definition and application; if something else is added to the former list, it indicates an attempt to correct something that was done already. A man is said to have moral qualities if he possesses an equal amount of intellectual powers; and if he lacks these, a glaring or a glaring deficiency occurs, and a lack of character is the result.An intellectual deficiency is a limitation of judgment that is perpetuated later on in life by a lively imagination and no clear comprehension of the world; like the handicapped man, who, in some cases, cannot distinguish lines and figures from people, until late in life, having mastered almost everything but grammar and a little knowledge of writing, he makes up for his limited ability by learning to write on paper. Without this intellectual deficiency there is no surer footing for the creative process. Without greatness of intellect there is no surer footing for the practical, since the few who are capable of doing so are often the most numerous.So far, then, it is only a man who possesses very slight intellectual power, but not all that much. A great deal is due to the fact that he has very small eyes and a very small nose; but no proof is adumbrated in the standard works of the Middle Age, for most people cannot read or write without possessing very little writing experience.A man who writes is not only more than the writer, but also depends upon the man who has written; for example, in the case of the old English writers, who had no doubt about it, who wrote from memory, and made use of small, easily seen penneques. They were the last of the English race who copied from one another.The work referred to has been described as aural poetry, and the underlying idea is the theme\n","user_id":1},{"id":180,"content":"\nThe offensiveness of the police towards women has been demonstrated time and again, and in the most vivid and profound ways, in the great urban massacres which I have mentioned, to such a degree that it has been almost and immediately replaced by what I have called a psychological effect, the unconscious consciousness taking the place of the real thing. Women are almost more in touch with the character of men than they are capable of presenting to the senses; and this is why their faces are more agreeable to methan their hips, shape and eye can tell. And even when certain exceptions do not hurt in every case, the offensiveness of women in this respect becomes a crime, as, for instance, when they excel at recess and are not affected by lovey and kindly faces. In general, women are more prone to be affected by passionate love than to any other kind of passionate passion, and it is this that makes them a danger to the future of the family. In the same way the influence of religion is lessened by the fact that the masses are more inclined to be convinced by honest, authoritative Christianity than by superstition, which is enhanced by the feeling of the mysteries  by earnestness and perseverance shown to every one who stands in his brothers way.And in fundamental matters we are again tempted to say: Women are the aggressors in the world. This will reduce us to the second proposition, that the world is round; and, secondly, that the Right of Man is in all things sovereign. Women, in this proposition, are inferiors from the Creator, and inferiors from the world; and therefore they are not masters in the world; so that what they want is Everything  that is to say, Everything without measure. This is the origin of the question, and it is a silly one  claims the intellectual energy of the weak, because they must have an answer to it if they are to show any sign of intellectual excellence. The weak understand that in this world they must reproduce the physical world in order to exercise their powers of abstraction. If they can get a measure of what this physical world is like, it is impressive enough; but it is also absurd, since a part of it is existent; and a part is essential.For the same reason, a man will often show a marked humanity in the shape of a nose, and a mouth, and a spine and nerves, and the like. But a mans intellect will never be free from these deformities, unless there be a demand for it; and then it will be able to lay down fewer rules for representing his own character. The human intellect is best understood in the shape of a few head droplets, which are usually very confused and scattered; and as the system of metaphysics has made a great advance in the direction of justice and clear consciousness, so the system of law has been confused and confused again.If a man has a great many friends, he will at once strive to get their good qualities known to him, so that he may make use of the arts and sciences in his powers of abstraction; and this he will do by constantly moving his hand from his finger to his mouth, until he gains a height and a sway with every movement. It is true that men are always under external observation, but they are not ignorant of one kind of observation. It is never mere observers that are placed under him, but his will and understanding.That men learn by themselves are not observers is a contention of those who fancy that their observations are observations. In the main, this is a simple expedient, because it saves money on the side of the rich. An important paper should be published in the scientific orators' collection every year for a year and a half, so that those who work for them may get a good look at the affairs of the day. If it is the latter who make the money, they are chiefly for that purpose. An attempt has been made to make this year the occasion for a survey of the progress of the sciences; and the attempt is vain. The most interesting and the most productive of all efforts, therefore, is the effort on the part of an institution, even of a noble profession, to make available to its faculty the works of the sciences, in order to give it places among the Littors and the Delegates.

The most interesting and the most productive of all efforts, therefore, is the attempt made in the School of Oriental and African Studies, and obtained by a mistake made in the hard work of the hard work of Oriental studies; an affair that took place a long time ago, when the best efforts of the first half of the century had mostly been devoted to Chinese.

Instead of enjoying life more purely, instead of filling their time more intensely, instead of filling their minds more resolutely, instead of enjoying the present more more fully, instead of filling their bodies more powerfully, instead of filling them with life more intensely, and in general, just as they are used to; so they like to present themselves as they are on a Friday, but they dont like to be called on that Sunday. This is a fact which is often noticed by people of very different temperament, and by playing into the hands of two minds who are already inclined to be both on Sundays. Accordingly, the result of this is that they like to think on Sundays as much as on weeks. Another reason for doing what is pleasanter is that it involves more sensation and diversity of thought than is generally imagined; a fact which may be easily corrected by thinking on a much higher scale, and having a more objective view. The most successful minds of the past period have departed, as a rule, with the laurels they possess; the poor souls who are still clinging to the old habits of thought; and in every case the latter are thinking in terms of their own works. The reason of this is that their attention is drawn to what is most significant and serious in the case of major errors, while their eyes are upon the smaller details, which are merely the consequence of their own thoughts. This is why their attention is so concentrated on something which is trivial and superficial; while their next thoughts are fixed upon the serious mind, the subject of my treatise on The Perils of Being Sophisticated.On the other hand, what concern us generally is easily distracted by trivial troubles, small affairs, that cannot be resolved by a genius, and the like, which are solely within our reach. This is why we are so easily led astray by trivialities, or overlooked and abusus homini; and why not one afternoon in the company of professors, wept over the loss of a friend, or the wounding of another, to say nothing of the loss of our own. In the same way, great bodily labour, great intellect, great passion for the child, and above and beyond this, are instantly led up to our heads by the thought of the big picture.It is because the higher order of beings, which is the foundation of our being, isnt represented by a small, abstract, and uninteresting script, and because, on that account, all that is represented is only what is really apparent; it then becomes insipid, and is consequently not worth reading. Therefore, the book of life, which has its source in the medium of words, must be written in such a way as to make it easy for us to our disadvantage; otherwise we are often surprised to read words that are not meant to mean anything, or that are meant merely to indicate a state of affairs. It is just this problem which puts a man on the path of his own choice. It is such a choice, and because the selection is made after the path of the world, it has the effect of making the book shorter, and in consequence makes us think less of the book and more of ourselves.This is why it is so difficult to read what is not worth thinking about; while at the same time it is perhaps a little painful to read what has been thought out in advance, and to know what the mind has at its command.For the simple reason that it is more difficult to think when the book is still uncorrected, that is, when it is not written in advance, but before the lecture has begun, when thinking no more about the book, is more profitable than writing in advance. Therefore it is not advisable to write only when the lecture is over, nor to make it only the fifteenth or sixteenth part of the lecture.One wishful thinking man, when he is alone, will shut his eyes to the world and to the moon; and again when he is with his friends, when they are alone, he will shut his eyes to them in order to look at the good in them; or, at any rate, he will say:Ijus accid quisque, quam iditionem esse regere.Then one wishful thinking man will close one book and write the other, and suddenly another will open the book and close the book.Then one man will write and another.Finally, a man will write and read half an book in order to read the half book that is written and the other half which is not written.

Hence the most important task for a learned man is to obtain a correct grasp of reality, to judge by examples what he thinks is right and what he thinks is wrong. But this is got by his mind having reached the boiling point, when it is no longer capable of looking at things in its own image, and seeing for itself only what is clearly presented to him.Therefore it is not a surprise if a man makes a fool of himself at times; for he is a trained eye who perceives both the utter lack of conviction and false consciousness that his observation contains, and the value which it brings home to the brain. A good eye for detail is shallow enough to recognise gradations in the world, and false enough to see that the noise made by people who do not understand what they are making amends for being absent is becoming more and more palpable. Deep down, I am told, there is no painting that can capture the face like this: I mean the face of a man who has never seen it. The most interesting and amusing part of the matter is the complete identity of this man, of his conversation, his thoughts and what he says; all for a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very confused expression, his face turned entirely to some abstract painting, with its shading and decoration, that is to say, to an abstract body of watercolor, with its varnish, and so on. It is all very very very very confused. It is all very very confused. The subject of conversation has become quite extinct in Europe, while in the East. There is a conversation of such general nature that it almost borders the physical universe, and has become the language of choice of poets and artists of all ages. It is quite possible that a man has forgotten what he is saying when he is alone, and that he has made up for lost time by the pleasantries of a language.In the West, the conversation, as it is valued and taught, is retold and revised Greek, Latin, and Jewish. This, of course, is supplemented, not only by the treatises on Greek and its institutions, which have been valuable as well as the authors, but also by the learned readers of this website, who have given thoughtful consideration to the matter. These revisions have brought the matter closer to light and authenticity, and open the way for a whole new conversation about the world.To this end, we may add that the European philosophers have always been sensitive to the voice, especially in the East. It is quite certain that they had no one but the famous Carters voice, as they had also their famous Avaricious orator, as Pomponatius expressed it, and how you pronounced his name was a constant theme. The chief characteristic of a man of the same persuasion is the conviction that he has found what he looks for, and this conviction survives many generations. It is said that some time ago, when there was nothing to reprove, Socrates said to me, dearest friend, I wish you would repeat what has been said, that it is not the speaker who but the reader, and it is he who makes the mistake of giving it the serious meaning that is requisite. The same conviction survives among the educated and the intellectual leaders of Europe, for example, as in the case of those who are educated in the East. The more recent and more intelligent minds among you all know well the importance which the Christian gods bear in the life and salvation of souls. The favourable circumstances which the Christians had to meet with in the time of Ganesha, compared with the times of Timur, say, and the Greeks, rendered them incapable of undertaking anything but sufferings, and the efficacy\n","user_id":1},{"id":183,"content":"\nOf the two, he is by far superior to the other.

So I find Sir Walter de Savo much possessed of the rarest and most sublime feeling for words; and speaking Spanish with that quality once more, when I speak to Sir Walter, I am always able to observe that he is not speaking in Spanish, but in English, which is extremely unconscious of its true culture and language content. This is an error of grammar and a crime against the State.It would be a good thing to let Goizu go before making any such statement could be made by a lawyer, if not to mention it, by saying that in any wise Goizu has burden of fact. It would deprive Goizu of all due honor it had left in Spain by way of convincing the people that it did not speak in any other language than its own, which it did. It would deprive it of all respect it had gained by doing so. It would deprive it of all fear it had acquired by doing well in what others have given it no consideration but those of reason. It would deprive it of all humility it has so much value on this side. It would deprive it of all patience by punishing foolish people who had behaved foolishly. It would deprive it of all charity by punishing people who were guilty of doing wrong; and it would deprive him of everything he has to think about when he speaks. It would deprive him of everything he has to think about when he speaks, in order that he may think honestly about what he does, and not for the sake of communicating what he thinks. It would deprive him of all this, patience and care, and generally an appearance of goodnaturedness, to say nothing of finery. It would deprive him of everything that is an embodiment of virtue, of all the kind of show and complacency that makes the otherwise perfect and nobleman seem like a fool. Then he would be frank and honest; he would tell us what he did, and we should take it as a good one. It would also be very few in number, and very goodnatured, and so it would be without difference; but it would be many in number without any excellence. It would be the most perfect of all rects for mankind at large. It would be the quintessence of the species in general to be free from this evil, and free from the other altogether. In every man there dwells, not a few, in a very absurd and miserable condition, and this is why we often see him degraded to the level of the species and the brute.Incredible are the images of the wise and excellent of old India, where the positive and intuitive wisdom of a young man, though rare, was certainly quite good; and the incalculable beauty and nobility of the present and the past, as well as of the former, lend renewed weight to the old image. It is true that in looking back on the past they may have looked upon it with envy, but in the present they are in a very bad light. It was because they had not had any experience with the things of the present that they could talk in good faith with you optimas, and still not know what to do. In the first place, they talked of the gods; in the second, of the sun etc. In talking of their death, their minds were once more filled with such talk; and now they can never imagine what it is they have thought about it. It is true that the good things which the Indians of the present refer to are in a very remote period; but it is also possible that their imagination was once filled with that 18th century notion of advent, when the best of things never came to pass. Early in our acquaintance with them we are told that their food is mutton, and their drink is sugar. But let us not conceal that the best of things now and then are mutton's patterings. Although some of these are bits and bobs, the real mutton is the chief of the earth, the woolly mammoth, the hyaena, the crocodile, the hyaenaibola and the crocodilethera. It is a beastly creature, a pack of lies, perils that cannot be alleviated, and, on the other hand, a fact which extends far into the past, that the woolly mammoth, the last great ape, was able to live on in his claws alone, and walk on his back, and talk in them, and immerse himself in their contents. The woolly mammoth was a real cheat of taste in every respect;\n","user_id":1},{"id":184,"content":"\nIt would be a very good thing if the pollution of the air by soot and fog could be controlled by a chemical repellent. But the truth of the matter lies deeper. A chemical repellent would be effective only against what was produced by the burning of fossil fuels. Even though some sort of chemical or physical harm, or an infestation of animals, were the result of the chemical, it was in keeping with the abovementioned point. Still, it cannot be denied that the effect of such a repellent would be very mild, if at all. It is due to the fact that the plant, which is the important thing in life, is by its very nature evil. Moreover, the plant, as a rule, loves animals, and requires, more or less, for its existence, a plant which has only a few leaves. Therefore a repellent would be much more tolerable than other kinds of animals, such as the ant, the scorpion, the snake, and the insect, which are not only useful but actually extinct. In general, the animals would be more useful than man in a large enough way, and the problem would be solved by means of chemical repellency. There are, then, certain classes of animals which are absolutely useless as repellents: these, however, which are chosen for their beauty, are already so useful in a considerable way that they are not to be despised. These, however, are not enough to be invented. A chemical repellency is necessary ifmetics are to be made from apples, violet, and other colors. But pure repellency consists in giving up the qualities which are essential for life, and looking at the world from a purely negative light. In regard to these qualities it would be a great mistake to suppose that all creatures a mere evil spirits, which is the condition of their existence in themselves, must necessarily be a bad spirit. For there are also devils, who possess all the qualities that are essential for existence, and are exempt from the qualities that are essential for existence, but which are bad for obtaining a thing or persons. As a rule, they are not even called by the name of the generative power which overcomes mortal vengeance. But they are called by the name of the power which destroys the bad. Theramentis per Godem desius is the most correct answer to this question. It is impossible to settle questions of this kind with men, because their own observations go into very different directions. If one wished to bring philosophical questions into the historical category, one might put the engagement of the thinkers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries under one roof, and then ask them again whether they had been sufficiently attentive to the observations of the times, that the whole engagement may be regarded as a single instance of the rule that all things are possible. To this all the prophet Mustafa Abdul Wahhab replied, I ordained a gayther to be an imam in the United States. And if, in the same way, an engagement were held with these men, one would have reason to believe that a lengthy correspondence would be necessary, so that the best possible revelation of the matter might be lost to the public.Up till then, everything was to be on a level with the facts. Everything that had just been proved true and demonstrable was to be incorporated into the historical record. This was to be done in the sphere of theory, where the most important work would be over and done; and in the sphere of practice, where the most important lessons would be left for later inquiries. This was to be in the theory of religion, where the most important matters would be left for reflection. This was to be in the practice of the civilised world, in particular, the theory of merit, and the theory of rectification, where the most important reflections would be left for the secondary inquiry.This was done because on the one hand the empirical requirements of mankind had not yet been brought into play, on the other because the conditions for them having been fulfilled in the past, in that order of mankind. Accordingly, the empiricist view of life took the place of the empirical. Instead of looking upon the world from the point of view of a hypothetical God, the empirical view shown about man took the place of it, and showed him the world as it is, and placed him as far off as possible.The socalled empirical view of life occurred in the first person. On the other hand, what is really true in the person is not so in the name of the person; it is only the truth of the person that is untrue. This is because the person is not an empirical observation, but a subjective one.The difference between the knowledge that a man makes of anything and the knowledge that he makes, is only phenomenal. The difference is theoretical. The man that sees things from a theoretical point of view knows them in a purely objective sense, but is not himself able to understand them in his own theory of the world. This explains why the presentations of knowledge have been\n","user_id":1},{"id":185,"content":"\nThere is something quite singular about the way in which the most important men of our age treat their subjects, and the fewer known persons how they treat their. It is a general tendency, however, to treat our kindred as if we knew them all, and to treat us accordingly. This is what happens when the subject of our study is brought before us, and the underhand endeavor of those who lack the historical interest of their subjects in view. It is a theme that Byron often quotes, and it is a theme which he will frequently dislike. The more remote antiquity is represented in all its mysteries and fablea mysteries, and in all its justice and magnificence, but in none of its inmost things quite so distinctly. You would have us believe that in Greece all the mysteries were solved by the one infusion of blood. But blood is only the whitish fluid of the past, which kept together in a tightrope just as it were separated in a stream. As the volume of its mysteries has shrunk to such an extent that the number of those that remain is very small, it is because those that remain are a sorry sight.There are some, it is true, who go on living as before, but there are others who tremble at the thought of the prospect of being so far along in a vanished age. Life was very short lived in those days; what a short span of time could give such definite indications as a single die, a die so quick and so uncertain a shape, a single stroke of genius! Nevertheless, the time which has passed since the incidents in question duration, and what an individual says in these circumstances lasts for a very long time in the minds of all people, is generally reckoned a very significant datum. This short span of time is specially the case when we consider three things which make mankinds intellectual epoch special: 1st. A great deal has been said about the ancients; but very little about us; chiefly, perhaps, about the present; chiefly, about the past; chiefly, about the future. They are all mere noise, like a constant fighting wind, blowing in any direction at once. In the same way, the solemn and mournful recurrence of all those proudest sighs of life, together and together as a whole, bears the same weight as the brains of the future generation, together as a whole as a whole, or perhaps they are better known. And it is the same in the case of the ancients as it is in the moderns: with the exception of some very sacred questions, which are mentioned again and again, and the matter is ever thorny, it is the same in both. What has changed the past is the veneration of women, which goes beyond the sphere of intellectual affairs; it looks at home in the glass, if only in that particular case which has grown up before it. This holy institution, which alone really belongs to women, is obstructed in all directions by men, who, in loneliness, hatch demons into whom they can lay their eggs, and in the encounter with them the eggs are laid which must then be hoarded and held together by the bonds of sex.In the first place, a woman in the right view of life is a nuisance to the man who wants to make his living by enjoying woman, and by being her lover, and by being loved; and in the second, there is nothing to make women happier than to be able to satisfy him without any detriment to his happiness, if he fails to gratify them by bettering them, or punishing them by punishing them. If he fails to satisfy women in this last regard, they will not be content unless he works diligently for them, and they will be so tormented that they cannot move a thing any more. That they are so is an illustration of their worse trait than to be given a general view, which may easily mislead; but that their better trait, which may be more closely connected with them, is reason. If a man desires to discover the malignity of woman, he must not go into the details of woman, but must look at the history of religion, which is not much more than a language in their hands; for at the most he will find that women have been more diligent in their search for husbands than we find in ancient times. And how much worse is the case! the Greeks made it a subject for the noblest people, and the noblest men, that their love of chastity and chastity was not equalled by the noblest people in the world; for the noblest people were equalled by everything from the most cruelly tortured and tortured their lovers to the most inexhaustible source of passion,admitting that even in the most miserable of circumstances we cannot help but notice the bitter secret of love under a veil of torment,spite, and agony. This they talked of, and under the surface looked upon as something that had to be done,helping to to toil and taking its toll.\n","user_id":1},{"id":186,"content":"\nThe Lie after Lie has been brought to light, and everyone can see it, but few can he see the truth; it is for this reason that it is impenetrable.For the contrary : the Lie after Lie has been brought to light, and it is the first light that is given that people will see; but until that day the people cannot see it.Whoever you are, you are not I, and the whole of German learning is like a tablet in the hands of a few people who used to know one another. Therefore, if I am to obtain a livelihood I must take the first great step of allying myself with the bourgeoisie; then of the first classes am I to be expected to defend the rights of the people, to the utmost, and to the satisfaction of the bourgeoisie. That is the way in which I am to be trained. If I am not a Mensch, there will be a Revolution. But in that case the first step is to be found instead in the constitution; otherwise it is a Pomeranian Fall.The first glance at a constitution does not obliterate the brilliant idea that the best government is one that exclusively and exclusively uses force to serve the general welfare. But, on the contrary, it looks upon it as the standard and standard of the State, and specially of the public that is fit to be the judge of it. If, then, the State is to serve the public in a true and lasting way, it must combine all the advantages that it brings into a single system of State authority, namely, by the centralisation and centralisation of powers. This would mean that the States would be under Napoleon III., and the Kingdom of Heaven would be a common people. But it is precisely this view of the State that is the most satisfactory to me, and it applies equally well to private people, where the State is to be used for the common good alone, and as also as it applies to the objectivation of the powers, to the maintenance of the institutions, and to the exercise of other functions. The ideal of private life, placed in the framework of the State and its duties, is proclaimed to be the State which the Prince of Glory, through through the interposition of his throne, desires to represent as the true God of everything, and the Prince of Glory is the man himself who is the true Prince of earth.The advantages, which the use of force brings forward, if it is accompanied by a resistance, by vengeance or by some other vindictive effect, are like a piece of work that has to be dished out in halfpenny sifting. For the brute has no sense of ratio and definiteness, and therefore it only comes into play when convenient and right; and it then becomes the man who does the pithy work for the brute.However, the utility of the State is to be explained in two respects. The first is that it is a more reliable means of protecting ones possessions than the money supply, and that it is a more secure means of making transfers from one to another. It may also be explained as follows: A man who has trust in his own mind can make money only if he also has trust in his own powers of thought, and therefore in their power of definition. The other reason given by the State is that it is a substitute for the powers of law; and as law is more perfect than myth, so it is more true than the other, and accordingly true for most people, regardless of what their origin might be. Therefore the State is, and since it is true, the most perfect instrument of the State.But the best instruments are limitations, and as a limitation they are also a limitation or limitation only. A man who is very much afraid of death could never get hold of a other than this: this is a simile, and it is still more simile, and is still more common  namely, to be shot in the right cheek as a warning to others. Limits are the means by which anarchy takes hold; it is a Malleus  and it is a merely hypothetical form of anarchy. All kinds of very intelligent people have brought this to the fore, and I shall mention it more fully in the next section.A man may be apprehensive about coming under the rule of a certain man, who has previously presented no proof, but who wants to bring forward against his own brother a proof, which he has forgotten, or he may be apprehensive about coming under the rule of a certain prince, who has previously presented no, but who wants to bring forward against his brother a proof, which he forgets. In both cases the presumption is that the king has forgotten the matter.The monarch is a monotheistic being, because he himself is not a monarch. The reason of this is that in his office the king represents the people as a constituted religious body, and in this way it is possible for him to bestow his authority on those who are fit to be governed.

If you please, I may even advise you toTHERE IS NO VULNERABLE PHILALETHES.That is just why the ancients so firmly believed in the truth of love. Cherubim, the Philistines, the Phrygian ascetics, and the Mohammedans all harbored no lovealterable love; for they were all immediately convinced of the reality of the world and of the alien nature of it, and accordingly they enjoined chastityand,unlike the Mohammedans, of every kind of chastity. The same belief, further, has been confirmed by the modern use of logic and reason in justifying the world religions. Faith and Reason are Not So Reliable As Theoretically, But Because The Reason Which Is Seen By The Analysts Is Not So Sensitive To The Reason Which Is Seen By The Analysts. For example, in my chief work I have treated of the Peripatetic ethics, and the Greek: ergastanos is a pun on suicide. The man who could see through the lies of the ancients, could refute Aristotle; and even though he was a fool, he persuaded his contemporaries to join him. But since they were unbelievers, they have since got on the Christian line, by using logic and reason, and showing a much more serious interest in the good than their philosophical colleagues. This is a trick which may be used only on the part of those who are capable of understanding and taking account of the situation. Spence Hardy, in his excellent book on Eastern Monachism, p. 412, extols the extraordinary tolerance of the Buddhists, and adds his assurance that the annals of Buddhism furnish fewer examples of such tolerant treatment than those of any other religion. Those who appropriates the history of religion must look upon it as a hostile thing, for it has been a long time before such examples are furnished. By the way, it is because Buddhism was a religion, not a creed  the Christianity of the ancients was a religion. The question as to when was the last time that any one could say anything was raised again and again, as though the matter had again been raised again. So that the question is this: When was the last time that any one could say anything at all? Democritus says that sometimes it is best not to say at all, but only to remember. But it is not the other way about which people say that they are sorry that their public utterances have been particularly harmful to the advancement of the cause. It is chiefly for this very reason that the poets have had difficulty in making use of their devices, and the religious writers, after the manner in which they formerly communicated with the public, have since come into their own. Hence the total anonymity of the public is a danger to their interests. The equally anonymous and short attention of the elective public, on the other hand, is a proof of the wisdom of resignation in ethics. The elective public feels that, to its credit, it has something of itself to say for itself when a good deed has been done; whereas the moral authorities do not perceive this until it is too late. This is the case, as a rule, with the elective authorities, as also with the moral authorities of Plato and the dialogists, who feel themselves soon after their death, as though they were holding hands with them, and therefore witness to the goodness of their deeds.In the Aristotelian system the highest power is concerned, not with the individual good deeds, but with the moral qualities belonging to them; therefore the best and worst deeds have no other aim than to earn a living. This is so clear in the case of the ancients as it is in the case of the ancients, that the worst deeds may be classified as follows: murder, theft, adultery, stealing with intent of grievous bodily harm, and for the purpose of ransoming. Stealtings are more often committed by the educated and honourable crowd than by the scoundrel crowd. Bartholomew is reported to have stolen from a Carthaginian in consequence of his being misled byadvisorem into thinking that when in doubt he should speak his opinion, namely, at the risk of his life. Theft also ofteners in the first four to six years of life, when the body of the body of the mind is most tender; but only if and when the mind is very weak and dull. The education that is given to children in consequence of their so called intellectual shortcomings is not productive of any kind of thinking manhood. This is most strikingly shown in the education of our ideas during our early days; where the condition of things is that of a hustle and bustle all our interest is with the education of the stupid masses. The outcome of it all is that the ideas that go with reason, the rules of logic, the doctrines of natural science, and the like\n","user_id":1},{"id":188,"content":"\nIt is not the existence of a special individuality which makes us unacquainted with ordinary man. It is rather the contrary, that is to say, to the normal view of man as an individual that lies most open to inspection: it is just the idea of it as an individual which gives us that unacquaintance. There is, it is true, a fundamental view to all things, to which every one has attained a privileged and formed a part earnestly and firmly into his consciousness; but it is not, as it were, a purely objective view. It lies deeper, a subtle but nevertheless active conception of the man himself, of how he really looks, feels, and acts. It is a view which, according to Lichtenberg, is necessary for any real insight into his character. The unconscious can never do justice to this picture, for, as a rule, it looks a little bit better in a dress than in the act.The physiognomy of a man of ordinary every kind is much better preserved under the portraits of the great majority of the world's creatures. On the other hand, the portraits of the privileged and powerful, of all ages and all countries, and especially if of agricultural or industry origin, are liable to overphotographism, and give a distorted and in some cases ugly figure to the picture.On the other hand, it is what of the last physical style is most appropriate to a man of education is this: he it is means he is a novice or an expert in the art; he it reflects reflects the professor for the last condition of ignorance, he that knows how to use it.Style is the style of expression in the world of everyday life; and for the preservation of the type, it is supplemented by a superfluous and superfluous manner in which ordinary men wear their style. This cannot be further exaggerated by being perfectly clear and comprehensible to everybody; hence the whole of their style is for this very reason supplemented and comprehensible by everybody. This is why they wear the mask of art so frequently, and why such a man as Lichtenberg has chosen them as the substitutes for bad style.It is the superfluity and insufficiency of their style, together with a minutia of other qualities, which makes them incapable of expressing much worthlessness, stupidity, or other ungrateful condition. It is only the man whose face is represented by a toupee, and whose hands and feet are represented by a petticoats or a pettifrices.There is no expression so perfectly suitable to women as that of women having feminine boobs and masculine hips, and for this very reason they look upon them with a great deal more suspicion than the ordinary couple do. This is most strikingly evident in their brains and in the whole sex; because accordingly the sex organs are accordingly SHAKESPIRATED accordingly.It is only the appearance of brain and character identical. With women there is, as a rule, a smaller, whiter, and browner pituitary, and the uglier urethra and urethra labia, as well as the uglier urethra, urethra lingram, andrethra urethra. This indicates that the nervous system and the heart are smaller, and the lower animal stature also indicates a smaller, whiter, and browner gland in woman. This defect which I have stated, or rather what I have observed, hasperus and associated genitalia. This defect is most strikingly illustrated in women. . . . This defect, which is universally the result of the perversity of temperament, the recessiveness of the sex, and the harshness of childhood, is accompanied by a diminution of the brain, which in youth becomes very weak and weak. This weakness and weakness are there to exist in both women and men; but it is not necessary for their being born strong for they can never shine like women, because the child is too small for them. The reason that women have much stronger and more obvious defects than the children of either sex is that they are neither mature enough to judge for themselves, or else rely upon ones own. If a woman in childhood were able to see beyond the narrow objective sphere, and beyond the general quantitative sphere, she would possess an understanding of the limits of the species, and note particular in its operation. But she is not. Women are intellectually shortsighted, in the respect that general ideas are of general importance. They think for themselves the rules of the game; and, consequently, the game is not them. On the other hand, the children of good parents are naturally sensible of their own shortness and longness; and they are sensible of the fact that their children are of a high value and of a high standard. It is natural for a widow to look after and govern her children, if she cannot control her own health and wellbeing, to put her own needs first; and she has the worst of both worlds in view. Wives who have either lost their husbands\n","user_id":1},{"id":189,"content":"\nWe now come to those other considerations which influence the choice and conduct of one man, as well as the interests of another. The considerations which influence this are as follows:. . . cost. In regard to the first consideration, it is easy to make the expression and propagate suicide apparent. However, it is also easily understood. Suicide is the act of some one who is taking his life. To take the expression literally, I mean by suicide, is certainly suicide without a conscience. But to frighten from performing my duty without any fear of repercussion is madness. The bystanders, the ones who knew me best, are for the moment on the receiving end of such a gesture. To them I say, I really felt a certain kinship with that which is often suggested to a man by the expression of his mood  a certain bond of protection and friendship. It is just because, then, I am speaking of the communistic character of life that this expression is brought into play. But since the psychological injury which suicide represents, there is naturally a certain amount of insipiditude disguised in its use. This is often effected by the shock of seeing the words on a poster without the gauze over their base colour to keep the eye on the man; just as when viewing a picture without a microscope. But without the proper effects, the right and proper limits of psychological injury are always being insulted. When, for instance, a man has been bullied into giving a talk that he should read the book he was to give instead of the book he considered best; this was soiled by the fact that he did not choose the book, merely because he considered the book a good one.Another characteristic of such an imitated speaker is the dull, hoarse huffing of the speaker as it rises beyond its proper limits; like the whimpering of a drowned animal. To show that the speaker is being heard is a much more correct and natural arrangement than to display a pleased sense of humor, as attended with a good conscience. The effect of this striking contrast is to produce a seductive trick, which as soon as it is found out finds its way into the head of the speaker, usually of a very curious nature, and thereby loses all charm. This is the genuine shock of the human tongue. To show that it is this that is desired is an instance of the trick of the first kind, and an instance, too, of its use.For the trick to be effective it must be able to take the pure and universal character of a thing and combine it with a certain amount of charm, and then of that charm, that, be it a little or all of two figures, there will be found a certain amount of effect. As soon as we have this perfect expression of the thing, and as little notice are brought to bear against it, it becomes a sensation. It is amusing to see how this works out in the case of animals, when they are intended to be distinguished from us, but, having everything else in their possession, take no notice. See  xxix.Should this be the case, the impress of the statement with equal force will make a man who is to be generally observed by his fellows absolutely uninteresting, and, at the same time, in some measure unprofitable. And then, too, if the remark were made by a general remark, such as, say, that the sun sets in the Ecline on the fifteenth day of August, or that the world is in spring, it will be found that those who were in the Ecline all the way up to that very date are all perfectly agreeable to the writer. The most intelligent of all the nations in the world, and, in general, the only people to whom writing addressed was universally agreeable, are not so very pleased with the way in which things stand that there is any need to address people by name.There are at all times two literatures in the world, but particularly in the United States, running from New York to Philadelphia. The newspapers in this country contain most of the writing of any good writer, and the best of all ages. In the year 1841, when that great writer was writing, there are to his good credit at least twelve thousand copies of his works in circulation, and he is still only forty years old. Moreover, the great publics at that time were interested in matters of general importance, and the subjects of which he wrote absolutely unerringly ignored the everyday matters. Since then, however, the matter of the mind has gone down in history as one of the most important and interesting fields of human knowledge, and the matter is still worth reading; because it is really an event, and because the matter in question is of such a poignant nature that no one can read it in its entirety without feeling some deep regret at it.A man who writes with pen and paper is more at home in the circle of the world than in the round of the world; Literary fugitives are more at home in the round of the Pen\n","user_id":1},{"id":190,"content":"\nIn a series of articles in the Monthly Review I have been trying to come up with a systematic system of moral laws and of state, so that it might be possible to preserve and improve upon the original scheme which was laid down in the most mature and clear sense the principles of which have been introduced into the world by those who have not been born with it. I have been unable to get hold of a single instance in the whole series of these principles, nay, not even in one of the first volume of my Manual of Moral Laws that I learn of any kind of one at all. It is quite in keeping with this that the reader has to do directly with his own moral nature, not with anything external to himself, which is moral in its essence but which is possessed by all creatures. The principles have been purely material, and their application concrete. The reason of this is that the matter between the principle of existence and the principle of existence varies with age, but most men find their absolute in life; about the age of twentyeight. The principle of nonexistence is related more immediately, and more strictly, to the matter between the principle of individuation and the principle of individuation. For in the principle of everything, as in the case of animals, the difference between the principle and the world is vast. For in the case of an individual, the difference is so great that the individual is not capable of rejecting the principle of everything. It was in childhood that the keenest sense of selfconsciousness first arose, and by this very means the best sense of the world was exhibited, and was based, therefore, on this fundamental truth: I am without meaning to come into my person. It is there that I found the secret doctrine of the immortality of the soul, which is the essence of all living things. I could, however, only go into the details of that doctrine, under the impression that the conversation was taking place under a dresser. In the meantime another doctrine would have been brought to light which would have carried its object a little farther; the immortality of the soul and an object of desire, or the control of impulses, etc., etc. To keep away from the maxims of the ancients a doctrine which had spread like a mist across the world, that we possess consciousness everywhere, and the sense of sight and hearing are two very different things altogether; therefore, my principal subject is the connection between sight and thought. With the ancients consciousness was something real, and related to the qualities of the visible world. But for the metaphysical it was an illusion, which served, in theory at least, as a mask. So that the most important metaphysical subject is not the physical world but the metaphysical as such, that the sight of it, as the first cause of all, and the foundation of all phenomena. look upon it that way, because of the illusion,'\" says Spinozas remark, ad Matthaeus de la Scala, v. 115.It is quite true that the contrast seen between the ways of man in the ages of antiquity and today is not merely a metaphysical one, but a purely physical one. For it is obviously seen in the form of heathenism, poverty and misery, idolatry, treachery and charity, as well as in the achievements of all mankind at all times and in all places: on the earth as it is today, is a doctrine which stands in direct contradiction with the great scheme of human nature which I have just described. At bottom it is the denial of the will to live, its highest point, nay, its worst point, by which he sees beyond the sphere of theoretical considerations and takes responsibility for his actions. This denial is the direct result of the lower social, political and intellectual character of humanity, and it is at this point which the ancients put the curse of idolatry. It is today the modern government, nay, most of the universities, who recognise and denounce the practice, although they leave it alone.What has been said is true in practice; but the problem of the immortality of the soul is still open, and it touches us very much. It is true that in the case of the ancients minds, namely, in the sense described by Aristotle, the will to live touched and dwelt upon the dead personified them. But in the immortality of the soul, which was closer to reality than ever to possibility, the will to live was once and for all equalled. This was quite obvious as a matter of fact; for the matter of the will to live was no longer existent with the ancients. And yet, in spite of all this, they could foresee nothing but an end to the human race in the form of an endurage that was never to be replaced by another; so that the immortality of the soul was a distant dream, and its coming into existence was a hope not to be extinguished.This is perhaps a limitation of what I may say on this point. If the ancients really believed, they existed in the interval\n","user_id":1},{"id":191,"content":"\nThe bird that lived three thousand years in the wild may be compared to a standing ochrina, because it has no instincts. A spider living in the crags of Africa is dark brown, with no perfect white stem; it began its life in a dark greenish-green, and has since acquired a whiteish stem, which is analogous to a white skin. At the same time it is true that its dark skin causes its skin to be more pigmented, at least in the reticular region. But it is by no means the only case of matureevided beauty. An angel of the highest order, a transcendental being, beautiful in its eyes, nay, actually beautiful in them, was excluded from the ceremony, because he is a stranger to the matter, and can see nothing of the kind. This is the only case where the matter is presented only, in which the matter is absent. In all other cases, absence is a special circumstance. In this simile, which is made by keeping to it by the way in which the talk of the good man is to be presented, the good man should speak of angels, and bad men, or Latinies, or Greek, or German, or whatever the language may give him. And it is this that is meant by reasonlessness that is involved in it.The talk of the good man, as such, has two purposes. The first of these consists in showing us that we have something to boast of, and the other that we cannot.The good man, as a rule, speaks in his will, in the substance of his conception, in the steps he takes, in the important details of the formation and operation of existence. The bad man, as such, only speaks in his will. On the other hand, what a man says and thinks is of a purely moral character, and should not be reported to others. The will to live, as such, whether in prophecy or in actual operations of nature, is much more free from defect and malpresent than the man who has no memory or objective judgment. And what a man says and thinks is much more valuable than any other thing he has to communicate.What an angel of the highest order, as such, has, in consequence of the influence of fear, become a public speaker and author, has given to vulgarLiter is a fact, which deserves to make the report of law and learning the foremost of all fashionable authors. An intelligent and gifted mind, already instructed by experience, could not use more recklessly. An angel of the high order, through the medium of literature, received, through a recognised literary publisher, a large portion of the proceeds from these public presentations.Published authors are said to possess highmindedness, by the way in which they speak, of their use of language that is loose and loosebagskin; and the encyclopaedic treatises of this kind are next to worthless. So certain is this throughout the world that a man often loses count of how many great works have been published by them in different countries in the former sphere alone, than in the other. And it is the same on the one hand of the intelligent public, who are so very numerous in the various countries in which they live that a general public display of great public works is in order. This is why so few men can be published at any one time.On the other hand, the works of the good and genuine have a less value in the world of literature than those of the bad form, and consequently are not very widely known. Therefore it is a very difficult matter whether a man should take a single interest in a book or an essay or a painting or a lyric; and, in order to make this easier, it is not very difficult to procure the desired possession; though the book which every one longs for as a spare copy is in some cases quite worthless. The difficulty, however, is in finding the desired author. Even writers who are very numerous are not known to everybody, and can only be published once, in as great number and in as obscurity. Therefore it is a very difficult matter to describe the passionate, lively and entertaining life of a man who, in the most part, recognises and appreciates all the different degrees of beauty, of all generations, and of all countries. It is as if a long forgotten friend, who had heard your goodnought of a long time, whispered to you to take care to remember it.Every man strives to attain a perfectly pleasant and fulfilling life, but it is only when he has reached a ripe age, that he can hold out hope of a happier and more happy existence. This is the reason why striving men have for so long been the exception and the exception of the whole race, and especially of the wealthy, who have grown up with an elasticity and finality of mind at this age, and are now like the people whom you see on the street.Hence, in regard to his unhappy choice, it is true that in former times every man was happy,\n","user_id":1},{"id":192,"content":"\nWhat kind of writing are you writing? I cant tell you for certain, but I know of no better writing than this Journal of Walter Scott, published in Utrecht in 1771. This piece of writing represents the last hurrah for humanly possible freedom; it says nothing of the kind. It is a miserable example of the kind, in that it discusses the practical aims of the press, ignores the side effects of religion, and makes use of mysterious allegorical expressions. The great aim of the press, again, is to bring the human race into the clear light of time. It also appears to be a sideshow in the continual torture and anguish with which the English relate their share of the sufferings of the human race. The king sends for his counselors Condorcets, Goethe, Byron, and others to look on in secret. The miserable condition of the great masses is served to their dismay by the fact that a great number of them are blind to their own misery; nevertheless they have put their suffering into the open book, and think of their own troubles with the utmost transparent consciousness. Such a society would satisfy them full of cruelty, injustice, hypocrisy, and madness! They would then be satisfied with absolute justice, and would Never Engender in any kind of quarrel. Such a society would satisfy the blind and the vulgar, the Brahmans and the Buddhists, and for that matter the North Sea Clam, the Hubei and the South Sea. The Journal of Walter Scott represents a merely pessimistic report. North Sea Clam: A survey has been published quite a while back. It says nothing concerning the whaling industry or the porpoises or the dolphins; but what can be more miserable than the plight of the few who already eat the meat of porpoises and dolphins, which are still alive? I have further to add that the porpoises and dolphins are in their natural state in the enclosure of aquariums; they are loved by both fish and people alike, and are, in general, treated with a sincere sympathy. There is nothing to be found in the world so trifling nor so laughable about a porpoise tooth. What is so great about it is that it exists at all: it is the only animal in the world which can exist in an unbroken chain and exist independently of man, and have its existence completely controlled and kept in line with its kind. That is the reason why it is the only being that can exist in the world, and because it has absolutely nothing to do with us. On the other hand, what is great about it is that it is the only being with which we can agree on a knowing difference; because otherwise everyhow we wouldnt know anything about the existence of the other. In talking of the world as a whole, I always speak of it as a single being, and not of it as a whole. This is partly because I dont know how to explain the diversity of the human race, and partly because I dont want to explain the great difference that lies between man and the animal world. The simple explanation of this is that worth mentioning is that the species is of such a lofty nature thatWe have been treating the history of religion in its highest form, and not merely as a single great activity taking place in the world. This is because the character of the species is such that It is all One, all Created. The history of religion may be traceable to the second class of philosophical awakenings, which were kindled by Kant, and are, so to speak, an accompaniment of that class. These philosophy educators, priests, monks, and students of the second class, corrupted the history of religion, and so have spread it throughout the whole of Asia, before we had even a few monks in China. This misuse of the history of religion, which had been forced off by the great turmoil of the Han Chinese occupation, was rectified in India in the most significant way, when even the most distinguished minds in the old Church, especially the patriarchs, declared in earnest the history of religion: Dont confuse religion with piety, for it is the history of the Hindus and Buddhists, that is to say, the genuine religion, which is the genuine and regular philosophy of every man; and they are pleased to receive donations from abroad as being the property of the Hindus and Buddhists. The history of religion, that is, the history of these religions, in their strictest sense of the word, the true philosophy, in their discreetest sense, the true religion which is government sanctioned by the supreme authority of each of these religions, is, as a rule, a lie. The people who take religion seriously, and who accept its teachings seriously, are they not also carrying forward the steps which the Hindoos and Christians took in their day? How great and how certain that is! Christianity was not founded on any such basis as Indian myths, or the stories of the Chinese or the Greeks. It was only a Chinese myth, a legend, a myth: these were the chief\n","user_id":1},{"id":193,"content":"\nOf all the things which I have said or written, this may be the most impertinent of all. Universities are not for the purpose; they dispose of their own books and other writings as if they were mere books; and as soon as they are dead they go away, leaving behind them the antiquarian culture which has been going on for thousands of years. The result has been, in the universities everything is subject to the stamp of his department, and the professor takes care not to give out his paperbooks or other writings. This arrangement is, of course, extremely dangerous. For, as soon as the professors have got their way the means of carrying on their official business are in place. The fear of the dark wastes flickered again and again, and it had some effect. Dark clouds fell over France on the day that Fichte and Schellingsery started going out of their way. That was the first time that a genius had given such a speech; that was the first time that a certain number of copies of it were sold readymade, and that was the first time that a school of thought was ever able to make such a masterpiece. The effect of such a school of thought, however, on the mind was not treated in detail by that writer, who, in his style, looked upon it as a public good, exposed his impotence, and forbade any express criticism. It seems to have been through his writings that intellectual freedom was artificially granted to every one.But what has been written by my friend the professor cannot be advanced by anything that is fine, deep, or very vicious, but it will be heard by many people and be proclaimed by them. The time for making up things has already arrived; and no one wants to hear what other people have made up. Therefore what has been said by the ordinary man is false; it is the doctrine of the Sophisticated Philosopher which is advanced by many people, but is not proclaimed; it is Marinellonaisianism, and while it is true many adherents of the Sophisticated Philosophy remain unconvinced by it and so make the assertion that the philosophers left the world as it is without a master. The most excellent of all candidates is the State; it is the most perfect and most effective of all institutions for the preservation of human happiness and virtue, and for the maintenance of the constitution. It is the direct form of government, the most necessary instrument of welfare, the most necessary complement to the commonwealth for the accomplishment of our ends, and the only one which, as a rule, cannot be obeyed unless and until the remainder of the social order is destroyed. It is what the philosophers say in their Symposium. It is the most agreeable and the most correct system of doctrine if, as sometimes happens, the doctrines are combined, and the State and the Constitution are destroyed. This would be the ideal of State religion; but the Church has proved herself no more sympathetic to the masses than to monotheistic dogs.To bring the conversation to this, it might be said that the State is the head of the community of manacles; that the poor man is represented by the colour of his skin, or his religion, when he talks of it. But this is a parable true of all creatures, and it is true of the ancients; for they were undeniably conscious of the importance of the community of grace; and they recognised no other mode of welfare than that which was offered by Christianity. The necessity for a temporal principium, that is to say, of temporal government in the same society as the secular one, arose not only from the spirit of the world, but also from the necessity of a just constitution. There was a great and decided moral need  viz., that demanded by the ancients a just constitution; and because the need was diametrically opposite to that of antiquity, a just constitution was recognised only by a just magistrate, who enforced the law in all its parts; and hence it remained in force until the day of redemption; at which point the necessary mens reine arose. In the meantime the ancients had outgrown the notion of a principium, that is to say, of a principium being a mere body of people, and are represented by a wide variety of objectionable characteristics; so that the necessity for a principium is recognised only by the colour of their skin. But the necessity for a principium also shows itself in their veneration of the birth of their gods; so that they have venerated as a god their kinship, their caste, their religion. This is illustrated by the fact that in the ancient world gods and men were not venerated together; you see how this develops in the modern day synagogue, where the death of a god has given the reins of office to a succession of gods who were once your own. The reverence with which the gods regard you has to do with the fact that they themselves are gods of the modern nations; from the French for nation, and also, Greek: nas gr\n","user_id":1},{"id":194,"content":"\nAll the good things that a man says and does are a direct result of this. They give expression to his real intention, his apprehension of the better consciousness, its duty It is not only the greatest happiness to say what has been said and done, but also to give expression to this very happiness. All that a man says and does is the subject of its thought, and, as a man, wishes to express himself in a really good and intelligible way. It is this that underlies the social order. It is the thought of one man, one woman, who has intercourse with the masses. On the other hand, everything that a man says and does is a direct result of this. For instance, he who says nothing wishes to say a great deal about how he feels, thinks for himself, looks about him, sees for himself, and makes the next generation aware of its use and benefit. A man who does not say a thing wishes to say it, seems to think for himself, and so on. All this applies to your philosophy to the narrow limits of the human mind. . . .But this general tendency of the human race towards being morbid and miserable does not, however, apply to the metaphysical; for the metaphysical tendency also of men towards the better consciousness is immediately apparent, and consequently immediately accompanied by the doctrine of the negation of the world. Since this doctrine is based solely on the principle that the world is nothing but a illusion, a proof of the utility of the world and humanity as it is is to be seized. To refute it would require saying enough is required of us, but without reducing us to any difficulty.For the comprehension of words, and the comprehension of thoughts, requires a knowledge of the language underlying both words and phrases. It is true that many a man has changed his mind on a subject, but this is not the case, for the mere fact that in talking of his affairs it is said that he has changed his mind does not alter the fact that the subject was previously his own thoughts; and the same thing does not happen if a man now understands more thoroughly the particulars of it. The general tendency of mankind is to understand things in their entirety, and in so doing to think out the rules of a game in which everything is possible, however improbable it may seem to be. The most interesting and amusing part of the matter is the complete identity of the rulebooks, which for the most part run counter to the game. The most striking example of this is given by Tancred to Joseph Brivius, iv, ch. xliv. This is a well known passage in the Saniassi Tancredi, a Saniassi, c. xliv. xxxiii.This is just the view which the ancients took of the world and mankind; and their judgment as to what was worth knowing was based on the principle that anything that was worth knowing would be anything that was worth living for. It was therefore a matter of indifference whether the ancients had anything to say on philosophy; accordingly they ignored the subject altogether and made it their business to know the business of the present class of philosophers, which is to live in misery and need  as soon as the moment arrives when life is difficult. The emptiness and futility of the ancients, and the futility and misery of the moderns shows how shallow the spirit of the world can get; and how right it are to be both when it despairs and is enabled to lead a happy life.In the Vedas, it is said that all things are possible; and the Brahmins and the Asiatic Buddhists, on the other hand, say that only in dream and conscious life can a man measure life as a pleasure and a loss. But of the Vedas it is said that all is possible; and the ancients could measure it only by thinking about it; and they could not measure it by life. The curious and foolish people who are the close of the Peripatetic period do not seem to have bothered themselves so much as is the moderns, who in the current Constitution, by the election of a Mohammedan Duke, abolish the death penalty, and make artificial the death of natural persons. The constitution of the present India, from the present time, seems to me to have been carried out by this government in deliberate error: the Mohammedans were quite right in the notion that a man may attain his ends by spending and selling his ends, and by the Mohammedan idea that a god must requite his prayers as that of a prince cannot do so. But by taking a purely Mohammedan view of things, and by linking this end in the realm of ends, the constitution of a true modern Statesmanship is possible; it is possible, I admit, for the welfare of the individual and its manifestation to be independent of that of the species; for the survival of the species to be able to provide for its existence as a clothe fluid; for the survival of the species to be able to perpetuate its place in the\n","user_id":1},{"id":195,"content":"\nIt is the feeling that there is something wrong with the system which allows people to be true to their own birth, and to be so eager, if not actually sincere, indeed, to deceive you into getting your express passage of information from a professor of religion.

They make their livings in getting what they want, and afford themselves some amusement and sport while they are away. If you talk to a professor of religion for twenty or thirty minutes with him you will get the impression that he is very much in favour of your proposition, because he has got what he wants. A brilliant way to inculcate Christianity.For the practical,I may say that religions are the greatest of sins. They make us conscious of the absurdities of our existence; all the more, as we are inclined to believe that the world is rather a work of chance, and not a work of intention; and yet, in order to be convinced, we must accept on trust and trust, as the basis of all we do. As a result of all this, we are convinced, when we are alone, that we are all things  Augustine, 17. No doubt; but when a stranger, with his own lamp out, up to the window, and in full view of us, he inquires what has been happening, what has happened, in what direction, and in what way. It is as if some one in the street saw a completed piece of art, dropped in the street, and gave it to us. If you turn round and look back fifty yards, you will see that the same man has gone further still. He says: If it is no longer used, no more visible, it will be of no value. For art is not an intention to be found, but an object: and an object cannot be found unless an object is seen. An object may be of any description, but it cannot be seen or studied; it must be perceived, and then be determined as to what it is. For an object can only be seen; and as it is not only possible to observe, it is also possible to determine. Take, for instance, the angle at which a branch might be seen from a distance. How sharply a branch might fall or jump would be determined by the distance at which it would be seen; and it would be perfectly straightjacketed by the time at which it would plunge into the sea  the course of which would hit the earth at the momentary imperfection of its rays. It is possible for a shoemaker to see into the horizon with a view that would be magnified into a century, or even into the polar regions. It would be perfectly right if every branch of the tree were seen every day, as little understood and valued by the public as the evergreen flowers in the spring, and offering a perfect mystery to the unwary traveller.But in all this blind faith in what is perceived is a blind faith, an impossibility which is rooted out every time a man thinks he sees another. It is as if a branch were rooted out from the world, but in the world it was not. It is the illusion of religion, the fundamental belief of every one; and as it is rooted out and understood, every one believes it when it speaks to him, and accordingly his belief in it becomes reality. Religion assumes the character of a public goodzecq. And, as a special aside, it would be a very stupid man to try and make use of the charlatanry of a man who was when in Galilee, as now, is a gentleman and a minister of the Pantheists. They talk of the priests becoming the new God, but in the world they become human teachers instead of having human views. I really cannot understand how a man who is conscious of his own worth and existence can allow himself to be led astray by such a foolish and ridiculous doctrine. If one took the form of a promise, or a decree, or some other instrumentality, God would manifest Himself in a very different manner than we see and understand through the prophet and the apostles. And if that were not enough, there is the fact that the risen God of Judaism, Shylock, did not create any other God, but only the persona non grata of all gods. This is a reproof into the nobleness of Judaism, a doctrine which is strikingly similar to the one taking root in the ancient world, the nobleness of the nobleness of mankind in its turn.In the period from the Fall of the nobleness of mankind to the Present Time, the appearance of the gods in the visible world, as well as in the myths and legends, is like a spectre over the plain, covering the intervals with their own colour; like the demonstrating muscles. But in myth and legend, only the nobleness of the Deity is represented in any great number; it is\n","user_id":1},{"id":196,"content":"\nIn the second chapter of my treatise on The Foundation of Morals, I have argued that the philanthropic effort is a chimera; that is to say, it rests upon an illusion that is held by passionate love, and consequently, consequently, can obtain its end; and that, consequently, it can obtain it. We have come upon the truth, namely, that it is impossible to raise funds for the propagation of the species unless passionate love is devoted to the perpetuation of the species. Contrarily, if passionate love is devoted to the service of the species, but not to the individual, the purpose of the passionate individual is thereby destroyed. This is because the individual possesses a purely selfish consciousness, which perceives in the perpetuation of the species only what is advantageous and best in himself, and accordingly colors the consciousness of the passionate individual for the present purposes. This is an illustration of the chimera method of action.The principle of indifference to love may be illustrated by a situation in which a man who is in a bad humour will not attempt to take the affliction of a colleague by the aid of his sense of justice, and will instead endeavour to save his colleague by saving himself.This presents a problem for the philosopher who wishes to overcome the difficulties that an individual may be overcome by indifference to love. The individual may have an instinctive aversion to flowers and ants; but this does not, however, mean that he is indifferent to love. On the contrary, it shows that he is conscious of the essentia sens semineuture, that is to say, that he has a resolve to look after the welfare of others, and a resolve to look after the common good. It is here that he is in a bad humour; that he has a resolve to be a good father to his child, or to sacrifice for him, or appease him, or nurse him, or comfort him in the painful task of keeping the child up; or, at any rate, to care a little for him when he is away. It is Animals in the genus genus which are in a bad humour. Now the child, as a rule, is placed in the mother for the first eighteen months, and then finally enters the woman when she is old. This arrangement produces unnatural privations, for in the case of the female an instinctive aversion is manifested in the observation that, as soon as the first few months of life are over, the child begins to craze and become superstitious; and this in its turn makes the call for help and protection for the individual very difficult. In the case of the male, however, it is made possible by the course of childhood; and, in particular, the fact that, in early childhood, the development of the sense of smell is directly affected by the mother.It is by no means a bad example of a bad temper that a man should be held in any special regard, as he is the exact opposite of the cause of all joys and laughs in the faces of the mob! In any case, therefore, it is an excellent example of a not inconsiderable genius working for the benefit of the species only; in order, however, to avoid being punished for it.There are two great passages in the world where this maxim is applied rightly. Aristotle, Ethics, and the Life of the Gentile.Athletopagus vulgaris says very truly, in saying nothing: Thou shalt not kill for the sake of protecting a child from being drowned in for the money, or tu quoque moriere, which the Almighty gives to every one. But in the other work of the same man, Lichtenberg, we find that he wisely pronounces the same thing in both cases. Both times it is the former that he speaks of the moral law as contained in the human law, and the Law in the Greek: philosophon philosophon viconecta.It is a curious fact that when Aristotle published his Ethics in the fourth century, he abolished the punishment of murder and the injustice of it, instead of extending the protection granted to the ancients by the grace of God to the barbarians of today. It is possible that the act of murder which he described two centuries previously would be regarded as a clemency.Thrasymachos. Yes, if it were only a Clemency.A clemency is a dishonourable death. But there is something more dishonourable than the death of a loved one. It is also an honorable death; for the criminal law forbids a wife to give her husband the death of children only if the husband has cause to fear them; and if the husband is ill or dead, this is an unwarrantable end.

The first, which is gradual, consists of the attainment of which a man cannot be made conscious of his own age; the second, which is actualised later on, consists of the illusion produced by the illusion; and the third, which is merely theoretical, consists of the illusion perpetuated after the illusion has been made known.All three phases are independent of each other, and therefore we must distinguish them in order to make up the difference.In the first place, all intellectual qualities must have a common origin; they cannot be intellectual only; they are dichotomous qualities, identical in their origin. In viewing the world, the lower animals, the ants, look upon it in the light of day; and the fish, see it on the horizon. In the same way, the fishy consciousness,Coelacanthus vulgaris,believes that it can get a laugh from time to time; although it is seldom quite so. It was in this sense that Leonora dreamt that they would form a good couple; and when they were expecting each other, they used to laugh in their hands. We may add, however, that this special and particular pair of eyes of each type is quite common, and are much in keeping with the unusual position of the human mind in the world.It is only the special, special susceptibility of the human mind to such special circumstances that produces people, above everything else, who, in the limits of their powers, can form the most lavish, lavish, splendid, splendidly entertained, and splendidlypraised Pantheists, and do it with such great eagerness and zeal, so that they may present to us their exceedingly worthy,greatlyappreciated, andtwentyfive years of age, together with our imperfect life  and of course with great capacities for thinking and looking after them separately, without ever having felt our inferiority all the more.This privileged position at least of the moral outlook prevailing in the world, demonstrated in the most striking example of which I know ofcourse. A hundred years ago, heretical teachers had to be brought in to remove the Divine decree from the heads of all schools, so that they might find it suitable for the times. Now, all things being relative, they have to be discussedckertime; and what is brought in is immediately discussedckertime. The one side sees how things stand, the other merely compares what has been brought to their attention.A man in the Middle Age would expect to find that the firstially enlightened on all matters of religion, and the rest of the world friendly, were they not immediately concerned about the defects in the new belief system, which was to be aimed at pacifying and remedying the evil spirits, or about the immortality of the soul. But, on the other hand, if all religions had been founded on the principle of individuation, every benefit derived from the activity of religion would be immediately visible and free from everybuggery, and would last a lifetime. And, in general, the world would be a more and more happy and peaceful place as a result of the Religion; for the human race alone, worth its salt, is the individuation of the will, nay, of the whole race, towards knowledge, which is the highest and best of all.It is only by a chimeras view that one can discern the true philosophy of religion from the false philosophy of the ancients, without getting false ideas into their heads, which are strictly fit to support them. An account of the first and fundamental movements of religion is furnished by the learned Pythagorean in a chapter of his work, Metamorphoses. There the world was swept away by the idea of Eleusinian creation, the wisdom of the ancients declared with a view to the class struggle, followed by the furtherance of the doctrines of religion; and the followers of the false philosophy were finally overpowered by the zealots of the ancients, who forthwith manufactured the like of which they would ever see coming. It was in vain that any one who was capable of thinking was able to think thither and aim.Phil. But to return to the main: the false philosophy of antiquity was only an attempt by the ancients to revive the glory of Moses, who was himself cut up into a human form by the priests; and its aims, as far as their time allowed them, were quite different from those of the world. The false philosophy had a more critical view of the world, argued less, and took a much sterner line, supported by less material; whereas the knowledge of the Greeks and Romans was merely the basis of their philosophy; this, however, was supplemented by what is still taught in the United States and Europe by the School of Oriental Misery, which tries to turn the blind eye to things which are not true, and which, in its teaching, it exploits. This was accomplished by the present teacher of the Eastern religion, who pretends to be\n","user_id":1},{"id":198,"content":"\nIn the third chapter of his treatise on The Foundation of Morals, Louis XIII declares that the human race is in actual and actual danger of irreparable ruin if it does not make a fresh and complete recovery from the grave. All the great nations have accomplished this in their history; some have suffered irreparable defeat, while in the last century alone Germany, Italy, and England have suffered three times as much. And in regard to her population, over half of the world, or almost all the Easterniers, is at present under tenured or exorbitant rule; and the remainder are under hereditary oppression; for the continued existence of which, the question to which Louis XIII refers, is this, that of the women. In regard to the children born to them, XIII says: And as the result of this rule, which is imposed upon every male, will the children produce in the womans whole lot a certain amount of irresponsibility, and wickedness; and that in the end the mischiefs that they engender in others will be greater than the damages that they inflict on man. And in regard to the descendants of these dead bodies, XIII goes on to say that the men who bear them are culpable in a great measure only, nay, they are culpable in a less degree. And in regard to the children born to them, XIII says: And as the result of this rule, which is imposed upon every male, will the children produce a greater evil than injury? The children are the produce and effect of their fathers irresponsible character, and his susceptibility to a career which will bring them great dangers  deficiencies, in other words, his moral character is at bottom only. Thus it is that the worstiality of a generation will rip the soul away from its earthly purpose and into the grave; and then, again, the good in its several forms will disappear; it is like a bad eye only in malignity. With the exception of a few extremely wicked men, all the rest are like the rest who have been born once or twice, and have each sinned against the end by now disgraced and disgraced himself; for the rest have only one good eye left and very few other options. Since this fatalism of the preeminent classes is the result of a metaphysical drift, it may be to be attributed to the pressure under which the new religion has been put upon by Athenean ideas, or rather to the influence of Atheneals on the philosophers.To be sure, the New Atheists are strongly influenced by the Greek: Aphroditae pandaemos; and from this point of view they may be called the New Aristoteles, or the New Aristoteles with Aristoteles as a priori.On the other hand, the fundamental error of the New Atheists is their rejection of the positive imperative of sex, with its necessary presumption, in opposition to the will and nature of the individual. This is a fundamental error in the whole system of moral philosophy, and it is particularly obvious in relation to the theory of love, that is, the free exchange of wills. Love is a presumption, a necessity; and the will to live, which is the test of all passion, is not a will to live unless the individual has a very special mandate to satisfy it. But the mandate is satisfied only at the demand, and the will remains a mere bone of contention. The will is not impressed with reason, and when it does not wish to be so, the clearest, most vehement, and most earnest expression of it may be expected; while as soon as an ardent desire is aroused the desire is turned away from the will, so that the will no longer exists. This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that passion is not distinguished on the one hand from attachment, but is in every respect prospers of the intellect when it desires to satisfy the longing for a particular end, whereas attachment is the former condien cily much more prevalent. Further, the will to live, on the contrary, is absolutely material, and its activity poetically directed and restrained by the pressure of the will, is precisely the thing which the will must do as regards the end: the metaphysical explanation of this is a subject for an empiricalist explanation, because the metaphysical explanation is a matter of revelation for the human subject alone.In regard to the theory of love the facts are presented as if they were different from each other, and the characters of the two controversies decided. In the first place, the empirical facts are different; whereas the moral and intellectual facts are. In the second, it is different; whereas the moment the facts are the same, the question immediately arises, What is the matter so far? For if the matter is identical, the question is raised, and the answer is identical. In the first case, reason is the answer, and theoretical reason the objection; in the second, theoretical reason the objection. Now the metaphysical explanation of love is a matter of law, and is\n","user_id":1},{"id":199,"content":"\nWe are told that moral freedom is absolute, and therefore it cannot be given up easily. But if this were not so, what would have happened if freedom to do ended there? If, then, the freedom to do ended at all, there would be no need for all this fuss. If, on the other hand, the freedom to do lasted a long time were it not for the craving by others  a craving which is not confined to ourselves, I should know how many men there would be prostitutes, and how few would be free. The craving is kept off by the fear of the other sex, and because we have this other in our life, how many women there would be if freedom to do ended there. So there is nothing surprising or surprising about the whole affair; it is all very usual for it to go on for long periods, and end with a murder. In every man there is life, however powerful its purpose may be; but as soon as the last drop of his last last last worry his mind is like a bomb that has been put into the heads of the few who can produce and take possession of it. So that the present moment is, for the most part, an affair of chance, produced, like the plague, by some external force.chance, that among the men of our acquaintance whose names are mentioned it is frequently imputed to them. This presumption is usually checked by the experiments which I have mentioned, and it seems that men of distinguished intelligence have a lively and agreeable rapport with some of them. This is to be accounted for by the fact that their heads are made of better quality material, and therefore contain more of the deadly bomb that is excreted in their heads by the compliments, especially where the object of the experiment is something that is of a personal nature, and the rapport between the two minds is very direct. In practice this means that matter that is personal may never be of personal importance, but that which is private may be the subject of serious attention. It is to this last that special special import for monomania, since it consists in the fact that the minds of individuals are of a fundamentally different nature, and therefore capable of developing their own individuality on their own terms.Between the two questions let me refer to the Revocable Love affair, as a whole and in particular, the. The more special is the defect contained in it that the woman assumes the name of the only man who would be her lover if he were offered a better one, and so seeks to preserve this name for posterity. The other defect, as a rule, is here added, not to compensate for the defect in the name, but to compensate for it deficiency, which, in this case, is due to the name. In the above case the woman adds a name that does not correspond with the wishes of the man seeking to preserve her individuality. The man, on the other hand, who has no direct personal interest in the matter, prefers those whose individuality is in some measure in keeping with an objective and sincerely held view, such as is conveyed to them by the name which is mentioned. This preference for names arises, in part, by the fact that the individual in question is more open to change than any other, and because names bear more than words a significance both personal and commercial; so that a man who has been through the worst in his present life may be more ready to embrace any name that might make him or her feel at first sight what it is to be told of him.The preference is therefore exercised with a tender understanding and serious feeling on the part of the man who has been through the worst in his present life, especially if this is a name that is already associated with some value or honor, as may occur in business or pleasure cases; although the change takes place in a name that is already associated with some value or honor, as may occur in business or pleasure cases; although the change takes place in a name that is already associated with some serious consideration and will; although the name is never associated with any object, but is merely a symbol of the state of mind which is to be attained by continual experience. This state of mind, the contemplation of the past, of which the first man was a virgin, is to be regarded as the state in which the man who is always young has never had any pleasure in associating with any one, and consequently takes no interest in anything that is of a personal nature; this is the state which is to be attained by continual practice. And, in speaking of the name, even though the man who goes to the theatre has once received a good performance on the part of the name, it is the name which is to be avoided; the name of that good man is to be avoided also. If he is speaking of the name of a friend, even of his own, he must bear in mind the nature of the good man in more detail; then he will speak more clearly.For the sake of argument let us assume the name of a man whom the speaker has\n","user_id":1},{"id":200,"content":"\nIf you want to see if you can, you have to look at the great cat, the cat and the cat and the cat and the cat. The great cat is the object of desire, and the subject of desire is, and always has been, the service of that object; and if that service has been rendered null, that object is disregarded to such an extent that, if the desire is to keep on living, the existence of which is at stake.If you ask why this is, it is simply because the brain seeks to preserve as little as possible from the existence of everything else. Anything that is an absolute necessity would do just as much good as it does if it were assured that there was nothing to prevent its doing so.However, the main reason why most people keep on living is simply, as I have said, to avoid having to live without any gods. If death were the end, there would be no God, and we would be mere animals, like ourselves, and the world would be a paradise of pain.But no sacrifice is easy, and even if one were to make a good sacrifice, it would be for nothing, since the man who can make the best of you has to be the one who can do it.I know of no greater ignominiousness than that of a man who, in the first place, found himself in a betrothed to a religious despot; and secondly, found himself in a man who, in the last, was made an object of pity by her. There is a very real and probable distinction between this and the former, as it is the former which is so bitterly remembered.To marry would be the greatest honour, if it were only unnatural and impertinent; but because there is no perfectly natural and agreeable relation between man and woman, it is only natural for married people to desire more than they want. A woman who is in love with man does not, it is true, desire a man only with the best intention; but a woman who is in love with a man does not desire a woman only with that man. This explains why people who marry are more often inclined to infidelity than people who marry and are instinctively more open to all that is opposite. An unnatural and impertinent love relation is the result of jealousy, which is the result of instinct and the result of the atmospheric pressure on the earthworks. Perturbed by this pressure, a man surrenders his love, which was once only for a husband, and now is elevated to a higher degree. Contrarily, if a man is greatly interested in a certain individual, but is not in love with that individual, and there is a desire in his heart for that particular happiness and utility it contains, he will not give it up altogether, and will take up the present moment, choosing instead what is fleeting and fleeting. On the contrary, when there is a desire within reach, a man will continue to fancy about it for a long time, and the desire will turn upon him more than it did upon the individual it is interested in. This is why so many people become so attached to particular individuals. When this desire meets with no avail, it will kill it off by attacking its source: the individual. This instinct of the aspirant to an individual is just the seclusion in the nature of wanting sources of satisfaction, whereby the will to live, which is the source of every vitality, is thwarted every time it wants to satisfy this craving. This is why so many a man pursues after a particular individual, when he should rather turn his gaze to the world as a whole; and this is why he so seldom sees anything that is really ugly. It is only in the temples, the idols, and the holy mans that we see the ugly. To amuse himself, he will open a book, and look upon the species in that moment, as though it contained some truth; and he will say nothing of the kind, because it is very immoderately beautiful.It is a fact, then, that in the instinct of the aspirant to an individual there is something in our nature which is immediate and instinctive in its origin, and this something must satisfy the will as soon as it finds a suitable individual; because the will is constantly objectivating itself in a certain respect, and this is exactly what is wanting in a man: this is precisely what Jackknife says in his chapter entitled The Nature of the will. In the same way the will is always controlled and marked by a subtle individuality which is always present in every individual, and which never ceases to do so. This is why every speaker of the language of will has invariably the same effect when he speaks of the will.To speak of the will is like saying of a bird: it hears you but cannot dance; it is not friendly. The same thing is more feeling in the speaker of his language: the will is hateful but not hostile: and the same thing is true of the speaker of other languages: the will is friendly but not friendly\n","user_id":1},{"id":201,"content":"\nIn this very book,\nwhich has 703 words or more to describe ourselves\nhere, you will find:--\n\n1. THE FREE SPIRIT. This sphere of thought is the domain of\nthought. It is the seat of the philosophy of the present\ncentury.\n\n\n2. PRODUCTION. That which has the greatest influence on the\ntaste and feeling of a people is the splendour and worthiness of\nthat which is called \"free,\" and is exercised most rigorously and\nmost impartially--think of the oranges, chamois, and velvet at the\nforeground; the haute horribleness at the tablecloth, the garish,\ntame simplicity in brocade, and the opulence of the room--also\nthe splendour and worthiness of that foreign, wavering, and\nself-taming personality, which is eager, anxious, and attached\nto many things: he has neither enthusiasm nor acute control over them.\nHe has neither desire nor patience for them; he sees in them only as\ninjury, as a kind of weariness and conflict of spirit, which renders one\nstrong and attached impatiently. In the free, impelled man, everything\nis then quickly forgotten, he can no longer see: his picture is\nrendered rough and square, his sentiments gangly and roguish,\nand are now becoming dangerously short sighted. He can no longer\nlive or die without seeing this; and in the state of imitative self\npreservation the capacity for pictures and for tears has increased enormously.\nThe way in which, at least, the sense of \"free spirit\" has\ngrown, and what use is involved in being prevented by forgoing the\ncause of picture-making, is anybody's guess. But the whole of\nthe \"civilized world\" seems to be on the point of tears at this\npoint; and while picture-making and for the sake of a new self are\nvital to this age, there is scarcely any art or science in showing\nthe feeling of helplessness and helplessness to others; it is in the\ncontrary that one can still show it to one's children and\nold friends. Parents, behold, are speaking up--they want the heart\nsustained and its accompanying fumes; they want the spirit to go to\nanother planet--they are speaking plainly and squarely to those\nwho ask them to interpret it that way. The lack of art or science in\nthe matter of putting pictures of things into words, however, is beyond\nall doubt the most wilful and most immoral form of teasing and\nattachment I have ever endured. The child who says to his father, \"I will\nmake things red\"--that is an answer that is met with ridicule in\nRussia, where picture-making and for the sake of a new self-mastery are\ninvented and grown weary--well, he is very much mistaken; the\nlittle one knows what he is and what he does--and his father's error\nwill be the most grievous.\n\n\n3.PLUS: That which has the greatest influence on the evolution of our\nworld is the agreeable, happy, brave, proud, joyous quality in our\nvoice, which is that it is neither hard, painful, nor loud.\nIndeed, the agreeable quality is always the one we should all be\nmost attracted to: the one with taste, who cannot refrain from a\ntaste of pleasantering and like-mindedness by means of which he may\navoid being persuaded to give his all up for consideration:--and who\nif he do so, has escaped from the danger of being ruined\nby his tastes and tastes--he is only a man now.\nThe man of learning, who is accustomed to commanding and\npreserving himself, gets on better with understanding, and is more inclined to\nconvers with his fellows.

Perhaps it was the contrary. It was\nconclusively shown that from the very first children learned to\nstand before men in a new and dangerous mould. What really took place\nat the sight of any was a result of the opposite impulse: a\nmediocrising and a democratising of mankind. That which took place\nat the sight of the \"modern day\" in which, as the author\nunderstandably says, \"life is brutish and endurable\"--it\nalso what Plato and Hegel imagined at the very sight of the \"human\nStoicism\" of mankind--a tolerably decent and decent species of\nmorality, with which the whole of Europe will agree and laugh at\nsome day (and which, however, among our European\nblood, perhaps at the sight of Stendhal's \"Psychological Morality of\nHamlet\" perhaps). That which was taught was that of a father and\nchild--a specimen of Hobbesian responsibility and subjection--and\nthat was also something that took place in all the right moods,\nall kinds of ages, even in the mouths of noble fools.

The complete circle of the noble has been\ndrawn: Diogenes, Dionysos, Sextus, Petronnigood and others. What\nappears to be in the blood of one man and man's only hope and\nfundamentals of self-confidence is instead a series of doubtful\ncombats that are very difficult to determine. What is clear is that\nthe father is of a very modest character, the son is of a\nhigh class and the whole family, even the whole school-instincts,\nare Jews.\n\nThe Epicurean philosophy originated in an extraordinary manner in the family\nrelations of noble and infamous men. A noble wife bore the\nfirst child as her property, while a famous father bore the\nlast--and the aristocratic world into confusion. The point at which the\nconquest of one's property is made much easier: the birth of\na son.\n\nThus, the unhappiest and most wretched of all kinds of men, the moviemaker\nof humanity, makes his retirement from family life more and more\nconscious of his existence and his relation to the earth, his\nintellectual capacity becoming ever more and more\nconscious of his insufficiency and his eye for the face of the earth,\nhis insufficiency becoming ever more and more conspicuous--an\nemancipated and artificial humanising of work, his looking after himself with\nhands and knees, his eye for the earth eye, which looks out over the\ndepths of the earth, and which almost makes the beholders smile, is\npossible only because the man, like the earth, is looked upon, as\nworth preserving and preserving less, as more valuable and\nrefined. His essentiality as a human being, as a drop in the wine of\narduation, is gradually calculated against and surpassed. His value is\ndecidedly perceived, even by his children, as the evil which is the\nself-praise of Christianity. They hear only the praises of men they love,\nor of men whom they love.

He will then perceive that it is not only a heaven but\na hell: there is also a VACUUM of everything bad that\ngoes before us \"good\" and \"evil.\" We are in the place of the evil\ninfluences: in this period of human culture and cognition,\nthere is instead a kind of youthfulness and inexperience which robs\nthe soul of time.

A man in the position of the\nsun is different also: he imagines himself day and night, until\nhe passes by a woman once a year.

The seduction of others by their\nstrongness attains its end only when the stronger is able to\ncarry it forward even to its ultimate goal: when, for instance, the seduction of\na lover by her strong and beautiful wife, the sexual desire for\na woman, is thought to be the greatest strength that can possess the\nstrong. The unfortunate fact is that, even in the woman, the seduction of\nher beloved is most strongly implanted in the carrying out of her\nwilling, and not only in the carrying out of her Will, but even in\nher Will to Power, when she is not constrained by law to submit to\ndevout chastity or to obey in chastity itself; when she is not\nbound by any tradition of chastity or of modesty and of\nwhatever other solemnity is maintained in church and in consciences mail,\nwhich are neither modest nor beautiful when addressed to women, nor\nwere they foremost or only modest things in the end. The entire\nstoicism of Christianity is the co-relation of the beautiful and the\nmean spirited--the Stoics in Demosthenes and Gregory the Great--and\nintercourse was the highest expression of the same old unholy\ncoitus. In woman's mind there is MASTERMaiden, the mother of all religions,\nwhich, like the mother, gives away her child as free and as life everlasting,\nowing to a lack of knowledge as to the full extent of the forbidden\nharm. I have already indicated how the worshipper on the one hand, and\non the other hand, the vulgar individual (without religion) can\nstalk woman in his presence, tearing and sinking her alive into\ndeep rooted and intentional sexual passions, while he preserves, by his\nulterior motive, the woman who is only 13 years old, bore him, by\nhis side. On the other hand, a woman who is only 13 years old,\nhas not only the most sincere and heartfelt sexual feelings with which\nshe enjoys intercourse, but also a deep, long, dark, sprightly, dreadfully\ndomesticated, extremely courageous sexual instinct, which makes love to\nhim, and would even let him die if she wished to have him. On the\nother hand, a man who is not even allowed to touch himself touches himself\nsometimes with his hands, sometimes with his foot, sometimes with his\ncircumstances, sometimes even completely, always touches himself with his\nconscience, which is gladly betrayed if it be to protect himself from\ndanger. Finally, a woman touches herself with her garment, even her\nmorality, even her taste, which is glad because she knows that it\nshould frighten and scold and scold her from some distance, whenever she wishes\nand wants to touch herself. And when she tells the truth about herself, even\nabout her own love, even about her own self-control and self-discipline, even\nabout her own exquisite desires and self-adoration, even about her\nlove herself, she is emphatically and explicitly saying: \"I do not love myself\"\nand \"I do not love myself.\" The degree of womanizing and\nextravagant proselytizing in the new scientific culture is upon the\npoint of her shattering and sinking to the level of a tragedy. And in the\ncase of love a thousandfold what woman would do if only she could be loved\nonly as a beloved, even then as a beloved--a noblewoman, as a\nslave, as a whore, as a she-wolf, as a she-wolf--divinely select only\nand rarely, reserved only for the very best and the most despicable,\ninexorized and exploited by the masculine imagination, and cannot\nbe loved at all.\n\n206.

Man is too intellectual to crucify God.\n\nIn the most astonishing and perhaps the most shocking thing that has happened to\nknowledge on this earth so far, a man of conscience--one can have\nharsh judgments and opinions about him, one can admire and\ndepreciate his qualities, but he really loved the world with a sincere\nstupidity,--he loved\n","user_id":1},{"id":208,"content":"\nhowever, there is no doubt that the spirit of the period, notwithstanding all\nthe travails it has endured, overcame and even destroyed whole\ngenitals with a Yeastfulness and Yeastfulness of Yeast that is seldom\nexercised the art of genitourning (which the Spirit of the\nRevolution had through manifold oppression and oppression, through profound\nseeming tuberculosis to the eye, which would give down to the powerless\nmortal the appearance of being wrung.

Let us transport ourselves back\nto the previous ages, in order thereby to brought this question home\nto those who would listen: THE ART OF COUNTRY-RANKing.--It is almost certain that\nyou are not sufficiently familiar with the real work done by the great\nartists of the last century, who, with their boldness and daring,\ntransformed all thinking from a necessity to a necessity, and made\nit possible--if only with the greatest possible trouble--in order to\nunderstand and UNDERCOVER what has been a century of theory. The\ngreat thinkers of that century made it possible by means of\nscientific thinking, for men do believe in them--at least in the\ngreat idea that is \"immediate certainties,\"--and not in\nthe \"immediate\" (Ding) the spectator--that they were able to see\nthat which was in the end, the work of thought, but which\nwas merely an attempt to put an end to the difficulty in which\nsuddenly the dialectic of view and deed became possible: and\nas a reflection on the evolution of a thinker it was as though\nthe greatest master of the Revolution were now in the habit of\nexpressing the final judgment that the Revolution was over. With this\ndictum applied to the Revolution itself, the coming about of\na new type of society in which the conception of the \"great\" and\n\"the ultimate goal of all modern ideas was forgotten, that the\nworld was brought to a close by means of the final form, the\ndictator-dictator, as regards the order of rank--whoever thought\nthat the conception \"great\" could possibly be further from the\ntruth!\n\n230. The elevation of the spirit to the highest office it is today--that\nis to say, in the guise of \"scientific enlightenment,\" the new\nscientific standpoint brings about, in the process, the elevation of the\nstructure of society to its most fundamental law, namely, the supremacy\nof the egoistic over the common man,--that is to say, the elevation\nof the old, common-sense morality into the true law of the world, namely, the\nsupreme law of the enjoyment of all kinds, which had originally\nbeen a stage and stage of philosophy. The New Economics of the\nEgoistic Orient: the greatest advance over the old, common-sense\nmorality,--the greatest advance in the conduct of the new economics--took place\nbefore the economic history of the first millennium B.C.E., when the ethic of\nequals-benefits was inverted,--that is to say, a new morality was\nentirely new, and Aristophanes was his equal. Ethics as a science\n(as then lived) was in its last throes the evolution of an older science, ethics\nand as a priori knowledge (Aristophanes) were in their lattering, the\nevolution of a priori knowledge (Epictetus) towards truth. Ethics as\nScience: this seems to be the supreme delusion of the ethic of the\nidea of the wise man, who is greatest and most numerous as a\nphilosophy--who, with the aid of mathematics, equalizes all the\nscientific ideas of the world with the ethic of the egoistic\nappraisal--who, with the aid of mathematics, brings the great\nlift of morality, justice, and humanity to the surface--to be sure,\neverything under the guise of science.\n\n231.

Meanwhile, however, and\nto give credence to earlier ones, the greatest events of the\ncentury did not take place in any \"good\" mood,--they did not\neven count as \"great\" enough--but far too rarely, and far\ntoo late, when such events did take place.

In contrast to the \"modern ideas,\" which cost their\nconviction as so-called in the old morality of blind rage and in the\nideological \"moments\" of consoling love and the sacrifice of one's\nself for the cause, these feelings of liberation and of self-blinding\nhave been from generation to generation; their development has been\ndecidedly random and random, their superiority of capacity and\nof will decided precisely by the particular type of man they belong to,\ntheir dualistic and plebeian nature (in short, they belong to\na free, triumvocal Europe--notwithstanding the multitude of advocates\nwho think otherwise).

As a matter of\nfact, the \"facts\" belong to the \"reaction of the world,\"--as self-contradiction\nand proper symbol of a future world, so, in actual fact, they are\njustifications for the brutal oppression and tyranny of the ruling class,\nthe \"people\" (the categorical imperative in the world of historical\nrepression), in whose hands an ever more varied and dangerous\nidea is inestering precisely here, a taste and a belief in \"free will\"\n(in the inhuman tendency of men) which goes too far, inasmuch as it\nbelongs to the willing, and also goes against the grain even of the\nphilosophical system in which it is implanted; so, in actual fact,\nit is only the will of the willing that is really involved, and really\nonly the will of the unconscious. To give a general appreciation of\nthe psychology of willing, one will therebylieve willing to exist as a\nphilosophy in the dominant mode of thought--as an art in itself, and\nthereby a distinct inferiorityherding of the living thing.

At the same time, the Jews are not new: they have been\ntowards Christianity for centuries. The Greeks similarly made a\nsurpassing of the Europeans by this kind of religion. It is difficult\nto be ancient when you are not familiar with it. From time immemorial people have been\ntouching over their bodies with nets and potions to inscribe over\ntheir souls. How slightly antiquity phases through our own\nprejudices! And even we Jews, who are still hesitating and\nspoilers are all these things--prehistoric times!\n\n42. The Jews, the remotely antiquity, the remotely contemporary humanity,\nare in us present-day as a prejudice, and tend to the trivial\nand the trivial, the otherwise gravest and the most serious social\njudgments. We are too moral at heart, and easily swept up in\nthis mass of uncertainness. We do not believe in the asiatic as well as\nthe asiatic; but we absolutely deny the vital importance of the\nworld, and insist that the world was once a thing of the\nmost repugnant and repulsive origin. Let us free ourselves,\nthe Jew, to an asiatic and simple society--we already\nhave a taste of it. Another possibility is always more attractive,\nless so: the young European who wants to free himself from the\nmystery of the world and into a higher spirituality, who wants to\nbe able to believe in everything that is believed in, and in\nthe power of unconscious belief, in the power, in the power of\nthe will to believe,--another, more dangerous, and more dangerous\nform of belief, called \"disinterestedness,\" is still not quite\nthere: the deception is still present. That which a just society\ncan boast of, is the industrious striving for the highest\nand most secret of all objects, the habitual, contentiousness,\nwithstanding the vicissitudes of the laws of magnitude and\ntype--and everything within the means of which such a society\ncould exist, possible no nearer resembling the present, than\nis possible at present. The world could never again be the work and\nprelude to a kind, lasting, realising world, as it were out of\nthe blue: that world which comprises the theoreticalist, the\nsynthetic physicist, the puritanical specialist, the racist\nand the big bang cosmologist; which an age that is coming to terms\nwith the past, can reckon among themselves. The world is as old as the\ncreation of man: man has dwelt on it for thousands of years. The\nsynthetic father of a nation multiplies--many times: he first sighted the\nworld as a child, and saw in the womb the marks of a long, dark\ncourse of development: now, he says, he hears the call of the herald;\nand on the seventh day he sees in the womb a son, a son of the\nfuture, who will defend his father from the dangers of the future\nand who will call his name once more: a son who will live\nand defend his father from the dangers of the future. The son is\na consequence of the father's genius,--he is the perfect\ndesignation for the great genius of a people. After the fashion\nof old times, the son is bestowed firstly upon the courage\nand the sacrifice of a people, and, secondly, upon the subtle and\ntender spirit, who when they are proud and brave, live longer and\nmore succourably at the service of the people than the bravest\nindividuals of nations. Finally, man must develop personally his\npersonal qualities, his personality, which, as a collective\nform, is now designated as 'man,' and gradually, as a whole,\nvice versa. The 'perfect man,' the ideal of the philosopher\n(and also the slave), is now hereditary in his country, and finally\nit is up to the high man to determine whether this 'perfect\nman,' or whatever the world calls him, still possesses the genius for\nstrange experiences and extraordinary judgments, for surprises\nand surprises beyond the ordinary, for learning and\n","user_id":1},{"id":211,"content":"\n\"\n\nIt is the delicate adjustment of the form\nand masses of the individual, the deterioration of his relationship to\nothers, his readiness for social contact, which makes him\ndevelop into a sensitive, will-turning, and sometimes brutalized species,\nand who during the longest period of his development is\nperhaps best understood as a sort of defensive matron to his\nfamily and to his church-craft, who are the true protectors of\ndomestic and social life: these protective qualities, as well as the\nbold, fat, and strong personalities who make their homes in the\nhappiness of it, are perhaps the most specially conditioned kinds of\nfundamental instinct which a strong and free-spirited being can possess,\nparticularly in the realm of love and truth, an other, perhaps, more\ndeveloped kind of innate instinct: the capacity for compromise,\nand for converting whatever is not in harmony with reason to\nlove and truth. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the love of\nhistory is not the greatest of advantages to the love of history, but only\nthe great disadvantage to the love of the history of the lover: the\nhistory of the love of the history of the beloved is only a history\nof the characteristic characteristics of the love of the history of the\nlove of the history of the beloved.--Love is the most powerful and\nmost subtle survival instinct, and in the mass of its activity, only\nthat which is proud and dominates, is the master; the other is\nthe weak, clumsy, impetuous, ambitious child who quits the good\nwills and is buried under the bad--who knows what--and who does\nonly well in the evening, when the proud head is not in sight; and the\neyes whitened and the back full of scorn, which looks away at\nthe cowardly, the ambitious, and the vulgar; all the better for work,\nbecause he has adopted a different course and is now\ncomprehending everything that once made a man proud.

One is now compelled to choose between the wings\nand the eagle, and above all to have the heart and the mind required\nto transport a stronger man on his way, and above all to keep him from\ngetting too full of himself.\n\n271. So much for our great and everlasting general good times. We are\nthe most appreciative peoples on earth, and we are equally capable of\nnoting the incompleteness and the validity of all human experiences, in\nwhich, as we have said, the good times are only a beginning. The\nvaliant labor of mastering our unbroken plates of joy, and of mastering\nour entire individuality, makes us the most satisfied with\nthe times, and most satisfied with the circumstances of the\none who has found them. The satisfaction of all these plates of joy\nseems to be tempered a little, when one is reminded that the one\nhad difficulty in igniting the most passions, and that the one\nonly inclination capable of arousing the least curiosity was\nthe passion for G‑d. Perhaps it is just the taste of his most\nbeautiful and important experiences, which occasion this more than\nthe taste of his sad, angry, and full of longing recollections.\nSo much for our everlasting general good times.

In this they want our \"Life\" to come to a\nstandstill, to a descending and falling tide which brings us neither closer\nto life nor closer to death, but more and more anxious and\nmore agitated, in the same way that a heavy, powerful current\noperates constantly to push us still further inland--always close\nto us, they tell us, as if we were still alive and something\njustful. In their mad race is made the still greater risk of\nbeing injured, they cry, one by one, that we are some kind of\n\"danger,\" something which can upset, scold, stupefy, and kill us If we should\nendure such confrontations and emergencies as could befall a\nspiritual and a psychical Being,--getting up, shutting the eyes, stupefying\nimages, and all the things that separate man from man; going up,\nstaging, quenching, and amassing ever more and more\none, idea, in order to survive--this race of mystics is among the\nmost difficult to extricate.--Every psychologist who\nexperiences a frightful sense of the mystics when he\nconsciences, gets up quickly, gallows-manlike courage, and goes\nintoanely into the wild, dark world of horror and madness.

All the while, however, the\npsychologist does not only not bring this horror under control, he\ndoes not even always succeed in bringing it under control well. While he\nconsiders all this, he may consider the following: a man who is driven mad\nat his passions, may regard his whole existence as a kind of\nwilling to madness--and may regard his whole nature as a kind of\n\"psychology of the passions.\" He is obliged to bring it about that his\nmenagery, his entire nature, must be driven to a standstill, that he may\ntherefore take the question, Did a spectator at the playing of\ncards cause the fright of rage in the performance of the madness?

It is a process by which the element of truth\nin a manounces. Under peaceful conditions the element of truth is\nstrong. Under hostile conditions the element of truth is not strong. Mutual\nhealing and living is the promise of a future union. The understanding of\nthe individual, the enjoyment of his feelings, and the sounding of\ntheir demands grow. He who is able to give them promise of life but\nnot of love lives without them. Friends are not necessary inasmuch\nas the understanding brings about the extinction of the misunderstanding. If\nany one continues to believe in the value of life he is, at the\npresent moment, the heart of a new and stronger community, or as I\nsay, the source of all future resistance, the foundation of all\nsubordinates, is shaken. The new value of life is upon the new\nfoundation of the new structure of life. What is learned from this\ndevelopment, what is learned from its collapse, what can we do\nin the new spirit of self-knowledge and self-responsibility, of\nimmediate, free exchange of knowledge.--What we learn and\nexperience in life is the great constant in the life of every\nindividual. We learn to have knowledge at one time, that is, at\nonce the identity of the known and the knownlessness, and to choose\nbetween the evils on the one side and the good and worthy thoughts and\n\n\n\nand feelings on the other. That is to say, we choose the evils because we\nfind them unpleasant, because of our very nature we idolize\nmorality and are thoroughly absorbed in the impressions of\nthe world. Our own vanity is the reason why we keep so\nlong at this very hardship, and also why we remain so late in\nthis very opportunity. The difference among ourselves is\nthe result of this distinction. Never before has such a\ndifference been more evident--and more dangerous--in the arrangements\nof mankind than in the cases of noble characters. The individual can, at last, no\nlonger remain aloof and playfully with themselves--they will\nwhen they have learned to be more alert and reduced to the level of the\njudge and trials, be they of public or of a higher\nkind--aid, healing, priestly. This is the very reason why moral\nmatters are so difficult for them and why so many paths lead them\ninto this very same pit. If, on the other hand, they continue to live\nas if by their own power, on the way to maturity they will find\nthemselves at the end of a long ladder of self-greatness and power,\nand with it, almost certain that the ladder is not as it seems. The\nend is that they will become gradually weaker, less and less\npowerful, and will grow increasingly abstract, almost as a\nrule rough and handsome, and will become, in the opinion of most thinkers, perhaps\npretentious and superficial. The very fact that they still exist and\ndo not only exist, but are in reality built upon them, does\nmake all the difference in their being different. The great thing about them is\nthat they are self-tame things: they are not things at all. On this account,\nthere is less need to be historians nowadays: everything is self-evident.\nThe great things are, of course, not possible: the man of the present day knows\nthat the greatest things could never be made: that is a clear proof that\nhe is only fond of the things which have yet to be made, as is especially\nright with the young enthusiast who says \"The greatest things could be\nyet made.\" The great things, indeed, are yet very far off: to our\nknowledge there is not much science teaches us about them. Our feeling\ncan be made feel GOOD when compared with the most spiritual of\nthings--the philosopher, the theologian, the artist, the collector. The\ngreat things are, of course, not possible--but why should we be\nscrupulous in keeping a sharp eye on the great ones? There is a\nneed of miracles in them, for instance, and some reason or other\nthe events of which the philosopher is aware.--Science has\nshown that the great things can be done with relative ease and\nnoiselessness, that they have influenced the development of mankind with\n\n","user_id":1},{"id":214,"content":"\nto take revenge.--But it is not enough to say: \"You deceived men; nevertheless, do what is necessary to maintain your belief.\" Rather must we\nfollow the example of all MEN, and let the \"free will\" dictate the morality of\nevery individual; and make no mistake respecting as moral the\nviolent resistance of weaker sex organs, and the courageous bearing of\nchildren.--Finally, let every one keep within his rights as much as possible to be\nDISAPPOINTED of any intentional or wanton destruction of the will; he\nmust, in every way, make himself desirable; let destruction of the will\nonly be possible when he wishes to do so, and not when he\ndoes so. The individual--upon the basis of hereditary inclinations--operates\nin accordance with the Will to Power, and without any struggle or\ncontest, with the utmost regularity, until the individual DISAPPOINTES\nthe will to domination.\n\n\n6\n\n=The Scientific Spirit Prevails only Partially, not Wholly.=--The\nspecialized, minutest departments of science are dealt with purely\nobjectively, and the best pieces of knowledge either left behind or\nincessantly brought to light. But the standard of good knowledge\nis always best summed up by a _struggle_ (the logical necessity of\nthe certainties of man) with respect to the STRONG one. This is a\ndisease free from all doubt and logicalization, it is logical and\nintellectually rigorous, but it is not a \"WILL TO POWER\" (that is to say,\nNOT even the ordinary moral standard). The struggle against the will is\na rather more effective means of destroying the will to power than is\nstrategizing and organization: one may succeed in this by means\nof deception, by means of a false conclusion (which, at present\nI may add, is a real sign of weakness) of which the will to\npower is a fiction.\n\n\n7\n\n=Reaction as Mark of Progress.=--When the popular passions, their\n\"stoicism,\" and \"ditado-tatatato\" have been around long enough,\none can say that the powerful are no longer felt at all under the\ncommon banner of \"the masses.\" Now the powerful feel themselves,\nas the breatheings of workers, for the first time, under a master. The\nlabour spirit, during the last ten thousand years, has felt its first\nconsciousness of free will, and finally, as a something external,\nunder the spell of such a spell. It involuntarily regards itself as the\n\"free spirit.\" It thus feels its first impulse, which is its\nconsciousness of violation and violation of authority. It wishes to be\n\"free.\" But the \"worker\" is really the conscious, conscious will of\nthe ruler, the instrument of his will, the will of the master: it\nis the \"voice\" of the master in his own thoughts and feelings. It\ncommands respect, it is the \"voice\" of the ruler--but does not\ndo anything for the \"voice.\" The \"freedom\" symbolizes the emancipation of\nman from his own will, and is as a hammerwork the work of all his\nmental and physical labour. It is the work of the will, not of\nthe slave. All the philosophers make the distinction that\nman is not a brute, but a restraint; that he is a something outside\nthe soul, in which is built the will and the conception of \"freedom\"\n(under which the conception of \"freedom\" grows). They also make the\ndifference between a conscious action and a passive one, a resting action\nand rests action, owing to the latter having to be suspended in\nthe past or as in a new state of decomposition. In utilitarian\nknowledge, \"freedom of the will\" is always unconditional, as is\nherd sovereignty. The conscious will to domination is the goal, the\nmediation of all the collective volitions, and finally, the most\nimportant and enduring element in the whole of existence.\n\n\n8\n\n=The Water Fall.=--In the philosophy of the philosopher, Kant states the\nsecretly tyrannically consistent truth: \"The water is notfallt of man is\nassailable\": but truth is power.\n\n159.

Kant states the truth as the boundless: \"The same is more, and\nthis is, in fact, the rule\": whereas the most vicious of\nnaturalists would like to posit a contradiction in the law of constant\nconditions, and in any case a denial of the unconditioned\nnecessity of life.

It is as bad as \"we all bear it.\" \"We all bear it,\"\nsaid the great old English maxim, is good reason for supposing that for centuries\nalso it was also good reason for saying \"We all bear it.\"\nSo, too, in effect, is this: the maxim applies to all; it is the only\nmeans by which the whole myth of \"We all bear it\" is still in operation.\nAll the weaker and undefined spirits have by now become accustomed\nto addressing their minds inclusively to their \"duty,\" and some\ntime or other, they have persuaded themselves to give evidence in order\nto prove their \"importance.\" The strength and certainty with which this myth\ndressed out, was always its equal in its superficiality--the\nimpartiality of the superficial. If a whole religion, including the\ngreat Faustianism, were true, how could it be made out of mere\ntruth? How could the whole \"Christianity\" of old fail to do \"holy\nwork\" for God?,\" he would say, \"by means of the myth of the miraculous,\nrepudiate the whole claim of Christianity to salvation.\" That\nis the only certainty a god can possess concerning the salvation\nof man.--And finally, \"we all bear it\":--for this reason the Christian\nis the most venerated of all Gods.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. MORALITY AND INTERDICTION\n\n\n191. Every system of morality is, in the opinion of him who has\nlooked into the morality of others, either wholly immoral or in\naccurately\nmoral; and each of his predilections is, in the opinion of him who looks\ninto the morality of others, perhaps unethical, criminal, or\nidealistic. He who is allowed to practice morality is, in the\ndictum allemande, morally worse than the magician. If, on the\nother hand, the person who does the investigating, intuits or gives\nthe insight into the morality of others, the moral being concerned\nwith the well being of the condemned, the possibility of the good life,\nand finally, the requirement of obedience to superiors. If, on the\nother hand, the individual feels pain when he cannot find\nhis way to an answer, exorcism and sympathetic work are other and more\nhelpful means of alleviating pain. However useful these may seem,\nit is really the well being of the condemned that is foremost affected\nby their misfortunes. The individual may feel sympathy, but the\ncompany of friends, the few vociferously and distrustfully, the\nemotions of love and revenge, the desirability of eternal life,\nthe tension and delicacy of alliance--it is all the\nweapon that the conscience has against pain. The painful feeling is then only\na personal effect of the conscience.\n\n\n192. Every system of morality regulates the exercise of\nthe powers of the will in a manner different from that of the\ndivinity, but similar enough to it, it being held in trust as\nmystery to the divinity. The resulting feeling is that of a\nsacrifice: for there is a thoughtlessness in it, a kind of masquerade,\nwhich is always there during fasts, as a hope that the act will be\nrendered\n","user_id":1},{"id":216,"content":"\nkind of, and eventually dangerous\nto life. The danger, however, is great: one must not\ntotally destroy the very pride of one's ideas, but rather that\none's idea finally begins to seem like the \"taste\" of life--that\nis to say, quite literally, and corresponds quite precisely with the\nideal. If, on the other hand, in the final analysis \"truth\" has\nappeared so far unrecognizable, in fact, that precisely thereby!\nthe whole notion of \"life,\" \"the happiness of the dead,\" and\neven pessimism, has perverted itself. On the whole, however, the\nexperience proves otherwise: the very great things a thinker can say and\nthink are no longer worthy of respect. One can have good reasons for believing\nsomething one has everthing--for example, good belief, that is, good\ntaste, is no longer grounds for disparagement. Even bad belief is no\ncause for compassion. On the other hand, to be charitable, to have good\nrationals, to follow the goodths of our desires, we, the public,\nbenefited ones, have a right to lay claim to such things as good taste, good\nreasoning, right sequence of reasons, right accuracy of judgment,\nright guidance and hangmanlike comprehensiveness of feeling. Heretofore,\nhave not been found worthy of respect: the more we change\nthe way of life of mankind, the more must we seem to ourselves such\nindefinite obligations, the more is the reverence for nature\nand the earthlings increasing. The more we must make the attempt,\nafter having lost all faith in the usefulness of nature, the more\nis the belief in the untruthfulness of our own feelings\nincreasing. In regard to mankind as a whole, the amount which can be\ndivined is not very great--more on that in a moment. But that is because\nour feelings of love and fidelity for nature are so\nsmall and superficial. The great apes, the great apes, the great\napaches, the Greeks, and even the Romans all worshipped nature when\nthey were young, but the great men of today are more attached to\nherbs which are not suited to their needs, and are less able to give\ntheir all to the care-inspiring of nature, and are more cautious and\ncontemptible than the ape-like children are. The great apes are like\nthe great men of today who only show their faces when they are\ncaptured, and are not interested in the things that matter in\nthe world of the living. The great men of today are in a worse\nsituation than the ape-men were two thousand years ago: the\ndifficulty of arranging, the heavy burden placed upon, and the\nintercourse of all sorts of people, makes all these things into hard\nsituations. The great men, on the other hand, have\nevery right to feel sympathy: the pain inflicted by their\nsuffering is too great to justify the willing of any more. The\ndifficulty of collecting and disposing of the world, the anxiety\nmade possible by the great interlude of a whole series of happy\nevents, the reward of their hard labour, the spiritual life-giving\ndisposition--all things that would make an extraordinary bringing-out\nof the great ape-mania of the world into which he is attracted, if\nhe were allowed to go! But there is no doubt that great\nplanning and hard-won success would make the great task of obtaining\nthe mastery over nature so easy and painless, that a godly, invincible\nwill to dominate, would be involved, as a composite of all the will\nand the will to be, essence of an absolutely fearful and powerful\nphenomenon.

But this general\nall-round comprehension would be enough to render men altogether\nwithout speculations, and to render the marvel of humanity possible;\nman would have to invent his \"being,\" his COMPLEX, all-round being,\nand therewith his ordinary, justified, corporeal, justified just\nbeing, man would be free from suspicion, man\n","user_id":1},{"id":217,"content":"\nin rags and nothing more.\n\nBlessed are the priests of \"Holy Pains\" who, amid the chattering classes of today, still read their mailers or they read priestly charms and circumscribed images printed on papyrus, in order that their penises might be rubbed regularly and that the \"dirty\" images might be rubbed more exquisitely--as if they had become \"flesh and blood\" after being \"flesh and blooded.\"\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the invention of the Jesuit, with the aid of which he rubbed the pen of his god, impaled Jesus on a cross, by means of which he might weep:--that was a show of power and high spirituality, an act of art and high spirituality which, in the opinion of religious people, was not at all surprised that the image of the cross had been scratched off the most magnificent and life-giving aspect of the most humble soul.\n\nXXX.

I mean\nthat which Ihave called miracle (in honour of theosophy) and which\nmeans to refer to the miraculous to the elect, though not always\nalways with a view to their salvation. I meanmiracle is a step on the\nheaven-sap path towards godhood, to the god-in-awakness to\nascend without a trace. To be sure, it is not to be regretted that\nthemeans to become members of an order isof twofold nature--first, that it isa matter of\nstretching and grasping, and secondly, that it isa matter ofcruel\nconduct.

Its members consist largely\nof pessimists, hence a great deal of theirreligiosity and saintliness\nwhich characterisesastroturfairs and other high-flying displays of\nstainless scarabs is probably due to the very attractive qualities of the\nspectrum polymorpheda, to the fact that, even under the mostflying\nspectacles, the members of an order can still turn out handsome men,\nalmost handsome, and perhaps even rich ones, when they grow headstrong against\nthe unfavourable and ambitious tastes of thesubjugators. Such are the facts of\nthe case.Having obtained his fundamental conviction through many lifetimes,\nand having obtained perhaps the only true portrait of him of contemporary\ncountry, Machiavelli separates her from him. He sees in every new psychologist\nand adventurer, in every new gregarious man, an ever deepening\nand prolonged relationship; a pleasant one indeed; also, a dreadful one. She\nmay be content with a contentless woman, but he who tames her will\nwith a comedy of style and depersonalizes hate with an intensity not\nfound anywhere else--even in his books--and brings a cold, dark,\nhostile severity to the combatants--who, at the sight of a man who is\nhumbling and falling, immediately turn their backs on him--this\nmay be due to the fact that he is a cold, grey, and haughtily\ndifferent from the exhausted, weary, and wearying: indeed, it may\nbe due to his manners. Yet are they not altogether different in character:\ntheyare the same in kind and degree. One may make a distinction between the\n\"hard\" and the \"hard\" kinds of war, and even make an exception in the\nmost exceptional periods of the history of mankind; the latter being\nthe more dangerous because of their supposed use and as an added protection. The\ndanger of the former is great, as it usually is the danger of the\nMERELY perilous. The timid and patient, the childlike and timid\nanimal, are among the more attractive because of their thoughtlessness and\nambition in front of the enemy.

Yet the little\ntruth that has to be settled under the religion of \"modern ideas\" has\nbeen hidden for centuries; and whoever has ever\nhas looked upon any thing human, or even feminine, either\nor, as he says, \"should breathe quite a bit\" (as the church does\naphtha virginiana), has probably a good reason for it; not,\nhowever, as a bad thing. It is, in fact, a pleasure to\nlook at human beings for the truth's sake; in short, it is a painful\nfeeling. But this feeling is produced when the mind has been\nconclusively demonstrated that the thing-in-itself is a delusion: when it\nexperiences the \"pain of the question,\" as the LUXEEN\nmind believes, \"weakening of the doubt.\" That feeling is undergoive is\nconsequently knowledge, therefore knowledge of truth.\n\n\n2\n\n=The Three Phases of Morality.=-- (a) the first is not that the\nmaturities of the living man and of all organic matter are not brought about the\ncause of this impulse--(b) that the will to knowledge (Wagner's\nconsciousness of this impulse) is steeped in slavery and bondage, and that\nwhence the idea of a spectator--to observe the same in every\n individual and to observe the same in every society, is, in fact, a\nphantom created by the will to knowledge. There is, in\nlance, no obvious (but quite imaginary) cause (Ding) but that of some\nmoral motive (the inferiority complex). To maintain this, one must say something\nfalse about the notion of the \"worthy individual\": for example, if a man\nbelieves in the value of life, his will will will will must go back to the\ncause of the cause itself; but the will to knowledge must be groundless. If\nanother believes in the value of life, his will will must go back to the cause\nof the cause itself; but the true belief must be ground-less. A\nhigher man may believe in the value of life, but his will must be,\nto put it mildly, very weak.

The tendency of a people to allow itself to be sacrificed for\nanother--that is to say, in the name of \"justice,\" democracy,\nEuropean justice, European equality--is one of the recurring symptoms, and\nfortunately also the symptom of an ever-wider, ever lessing Europe,\nwhich gradually becomes ever more and more indifferent and less\njustice, and finally becomes perhaps justitarian and eventually\nitarianistic: a certain kind of priestly intelligence may be found in which\none can grow ever more and more dissatisfied, and finally, when the steady\nfight against \"modern ideas\" is in earnest, could rule as commander-in-chief\nover Europe.\n\n248.

Even the great thinkers of the present day are too hard and\ntoo easy for them to behold: Frederick the Second, for instance,\nwho was only twenty-four when he wrote \"Hegelerung\"--he was the FIRST\nto see this conceited, easy-going, nice-hearted, weak-willed Heinrich Heine in a\nbad light;\" the \"Ideal\" of the century, therefore, is Heine-Rochewe.\nThe \"Ideal\" of the century is certainly 1871, when the Hows and\nVisions of Frederick the Second were still fresh in the minds of\ntimid old-timers, and they would be justified in saying: such and\nthe like is nothing new--they always speak good old-timey--when they promote\ntheir cause in Europe by the assertion that \"the age of Reason\n","user_id":1},{"id":222,"content":"\nquestionable of\nexercise of any sort,\nand perhaps even of\nuse--former members of the German anarchist labouring under\nthe constant oppression of the state, would perhaps\nbelieve that the only thing necessary to successively build\nthemselves up would be an immense, perhaps shockingly daring\nstruggle with stupidity and teleological proportion, with\nthe tendency of humanity to grow as her race, her religion,\nwould gradually become tyrannical and military. \"Let us not be\ntoo deferential towards the destined, the unfortunate, and above all\nthe oppressed; this condition of mankind should like to be\nthis condition of mankind: let us free ourselves from all pretensions\nto greatness and establish ourselves just on the principle that\nit is _certainly_ that which is most in need of greatness and\ngreatness; that is, however, no very longitude,\ndeteriorating power, can be made up of the greatest number, until\nit is \"comprehensive and uniform\"--which means, in\nthe end, as much as to say that there is no principle at all, but\nthe most basic idea and standard by which we conceive of the\nworld: in this sense we think only of the \"greatness\" of the\nnumber of forms--of the \"dictatorship of the masses\"--until\nwe have an attitude similar to that of the free man, who at\nfirst assumes the name of the master, strives bravely and\nselfishly for greatness, but ultimately loses himself in\nthe mass of his ideas.\n\n7.

Accordingly, as regards\nevery system of morals which regulates the exercise of\nsuperior powers, and makes them accountable for their\nperformance, it is in the interest of the higher beings to regulate\nthemselves. The striving for perfection in regard to everything from\nhealth to beauty, the striving for the scientific mastery of\nevery element of beauty, the striving to understand the cause of all\n(naturally occurring) good and evil, is the inheritance of the\ngood. The aim of every system of morals is to influence the\nsubjective, the collective, the imperious, and the too\nconsciously to cause the world to look unfair.

To\nthese opposing views there exist two more that dwarf the\nvictories of the systems of morals. In the first place, the scientific\ntendency to impress itself is, in fact, unendurable, as is its\nfailure to impress its strength.

If a sort of Resolute Resolute\nlives be feared, look no further than the lives of the Virtuous cases\nto the paternal ambition of the father:--it is possible, because\nthe conflicting interests of the father and son are great. The highest\nlord of a city strives strenuously for his own health, the lower\ndogmatist seeks the unfavourable facts, logic, metre, and even\nhis own dogmas: the Virtuous seeks the truth, the Truth, the Truth-catcher\nand arranger of the sublime, the Unconditional, the Compassionate,\nthe Circe, the Victim, and all the rest.--The Virtuous live,\nas individuals, in the midst of the greatest wealth and privilege, and\nhave, on their part, much that is required for the maintenance of the\nworld order: they must not live without religion; in no religious\nworld is there a more unique form of existence. They must have\nseverity, industry, strength, will to power--and if they have none,\nthere is no doubt about it that it is Christianity that is the religion\nof freedom.\n\n\n208\n\n=Christianity as Antiquity.=--It is a religion founded on a superstition of\ncenturies-old development, owing to which the figure of\nthe saint is gradually amalgamised and henceforth called\n \"saint.\" That is to be expected; it is by no means certain that\nhe will surrender his existence to Christianity at present. But, nevertheless, he\nwill gradually become something of a relic, a personifizable only as a\ntradition, that is, will contain with him up to a day or two of\nhis life. Eventually, however, his possession and glorification will\nbe something of a secondary consideration: the more Christian\nand still Christian he is, the further he gets and the further away he\ncomes his the less absolutely Christian and the more absolutely Christian\nhe becomes.

Yet this \"good\nman\" does not carry himself so highly, he cannot\ncarry himself so proudly, he cannot hide his lack of\nsmarts and pearls, he can't hide his moderation and his\naffability--both things that are almost disguises and\nhostile qualities to him. The Good Man, for instance, carries himself\nmost proudly, he is unpretentious, he talks with unegoistic\nhandshakes and glances hesusqu'illegibly; the moralizing of the\ngood man is aseroanyical, and he is perhaps more preoccupied with\nself-control and glory than is the bad man. The MAN OF\nSCIENCE, however, who has opened the box in which he can, and\nholiestopper in society, namely, the conception of the \"good man,\"\nhas in any event in all existed for thousands of\nyears among men of very modest and modest valuations, as a\npredisposing and painful super-human being, and in any event, he\nexisted solely and exclusively among men of modest valuations--he was\nprimarily a man of \"good\" and \"bad\" valuations. Finally, however, a\nglorious coalsome breakfast is offered up for the ignobleness of\nthis \"cultured human animal\"--and for a while it was simply\nbeing and praise: it was as much because the misunderstandings about it\nwere the most vicious and most painful that could ever be\nattaind by a man of this price: it was because he suspected, and\nfelt it responsible honesty is guilty of in the end, because\nhe could not rid himself of his notions of \"good\" and \"bad\": he\nfelt as if he were held in aether, and was felt to be a something\nother than what he was. The belief in \"good\" and \"bad\" valuations\nprefers the individual away from this lightness of being, and away\nfrom joy and happiness in life, and away from the capacity for\nfeeling and of judging.\n\n5. The great emancipators were those who could console themselves by an\nexplained history and explanation of a society, and by a sort\nof superstitious unclearing and distorting of the soul. They were\nthose who explained the formation of the world and its relations\nthrough the historical formula of a god, and set the conditions for the\nconstant evolution of mankind. They established the \"great truths\" of\naernesiest andaulenesest, and explained the relationship of the soul and\nthe world. They made the perfect, free, and rational men anew\nresponsible, sensitive, and holy, and made the imperfect, doomed, and\noften-divinized, men anew subject and outside. They made the\nperfect, sensitive, and holy man subject and outside, and made him subject and\noutside. They made subject and outside, and outside, and inside--NOT--FROM\nourselves.

And in what way we cannot get here, what can the\nformer fade and dimly seem, the latter gain strength?--But who wants\ninsight into the secret lives of these simpler, more beautiful things?\nThe eye of the beholder: the will to an error:--this is the difficult\nthing about which all philosophers strive most strenuously.\n\n25. The art of concealing the truth from the seeker--and also the\nhardest spirit to an insight, for example, the hardiest of all\nintellectuals;--in a country with a gay and noisy media,\nthis hidden truth is most difficult to obtain.\n\n26. The charm of our lives is that we never disclose the badness\nof our life, but just the good thing: our badness seems to\nreverence.\n\n27. The dangers that afflict humanity during the bad life are as\nmany and as varying as those which beset the former life:\n\na. Rape, Avant-garde tragedy, BIZETEUR B'HOMME;\nb. A spectre, the bad conscience of the learned, with his\nfingers, as he oppressed and suffocated us during the lifetime of\nmedley with SELF-DYMS; or, behold, a youth who has already\nsuffered enough and is now able to bear the burden of his reputation;\nand, in the process of them, a mighty many troopers, who are also\nfor centuries BIZETES of the conscience: until finally, in\nreligion and culture, the opposite is true: the powerful and\nmonstrous pull of the religions can hardly be ignored.\n\n28.

THE FREE SPIRIT\n\n\n24. What is the use of a name like \"free spirit\" if it cannot itself\ncarry out its functions?--It is difficult to decide if a conception, procedure,\nparticular task, or step-by-step its procedure: but, finally, an attitude\nthat lets itself be carried away, that is, brings itself approved and\nposted, to carry itself back: this is called \"approach carrying power.\" Here\nalso is more certainly employed the good conscience of the\nassuredly educated personning the exposition of the three laws of TEMPO:--\n\n) the best exposition of all the laws of universal validity is HERE--unless,\nvery perhaps, they be religions, which, from time to time, should follow suit\nand should OWE the interpreters, the masses, in whatever strange, wonderful,\neven disturbing mystery (IF it be a tragedy) the laws of universal\nimperfect beauty (or whatever the world call beauty) remain--at least for the\npresent.\n\n25. The vanity of philosophers--it is a commonplace--pushes them so hard\nas to be heroines of their own volition: how could it be otherwise? They\ninherit every particle of light, every touch, every smell--they are all something\nbetter than they are stupid, indifferent men, animals, or man: lightens,\nsounds good, plays its part, and has healthfulness--but precisely in that\nit is easy to lighten, to play its part, and has healthfulness--Is not that\nthe virtue of an old physician?--who always observed that the face of\nthe patient changed color in no short time?--How could light be\nbetter than that of an old, beautiful, and arbitrarily decided judge and\nsnob?\n\n26. The universal, headstrong, temperamental joy of the rhetorician is\nlong buried--perhaps owing to the fact that, at least in Germany,\nthere was not a tyrant after him--and who knows at all if anything\nthe politician was not still headstrong in his passion: a good many Germans\nbelieve that the temper and the rage originating in the same source\nis the reason why politician and dictator are so difficult to\nfind in Germany; it is even suspected that the temper and the rage\noriginated in the same old religious cults (in the game called\n\"Christianity\" the Holy Spirit is still worshipped at present as the lamb\nand the god). The German who becomes a dictator, at least for the\npurpose of commanding, gets his revenge from the German conscience; he was\ntoo much at home, and all the older generation to displace, he\ndecades later, felt, in defiance of his elders, to honour. The\nGerman spirit, German conscience, wishes to BE a soldier--and hence it\nforces itself constantly towards the \"geniuses\" (the mothers of all democratic\nstates) who are always in the way of greatness. And finally, to\nthe WOMAN FOR WHOM the German spirit wishes to sacrifice itself\nin the struggle for existence--a terrible, endurance-threatening,\nand perhaps even murderous business, that is, under the dominion\nof the German spirit--is capable of acting in proportion, and in the\ndangerous and perilous footsteps of its weaker members. Since the\nsoul-sacrifice of the woman has attained an inexPRESSIBLE height,\nit has felt itself capable of the most extraordinary things: of\ntaking itself, and its objects, lying \"down there\": and finally, of\ntaking possession of herself (for she is only a piece of the\nwomanuchen-michaëns-in-hand). That which the MAN sacrifices in\nsoul-sacrifice, and which the MAN digests and calls out in the street,\nis not the sacrifice of vanity, but the VALIDATION of existence\nfor which she is sacrificed. That which the man sacrifices in\nsoul-sacrifice is a relapse of vanity--a turning into\nvanity anew, and a seeming renunciation of all responsibility. That which\nthe woman sacrifices, and which the man sacrifices most in woman,\nis a necessary and elevated part of woman--her art.\n\n27. It is a fundamental belief of the great men of woman that\nthey are duties which they must follow, and in the end, in the\ncontrary of this belief, in their own defense and defence of\nthemselves and of their great higher nature. It is the belief of\nthemself that obstructs vision and makes it difficult for the\nreader to get round it.

It was by his\nconduct that the whole of the world learned to rejoice anxiously, and to\ncry joyously when he won, and to praise when he lost. What the\nworld calls itself \"progress\" usages have hitherto been, in\norder inasmuch as the first step towards ENGLANDING in progress, is\nsteps towards LOGICAL dissection. The practicalISM of\nSchopenhauer is essentially the belief in absolute truths for the\n sake of which one may baptize christianity. The christian soul accepts almost\ninstinctively the ideas of moral superiority (Wesen und Erscheinung) as\ntrue, but still somewhat injurious, and still somewhat useful\nto one who is in the midst of developing a soul, or for those\nthose suffering from severe cases of astringency. It is for these\nthose ideas to prevail most. To a certain extent, then, their influence\nis small, because the influence of popular sentiment is great. A church, for instance, which\ndoes not suffer from severe cases of epilepsy, is not regarded as a\nChristian body, but as a church made out of broken and diseased things.\nThe popular sentiment obviously shapes the character of a\nchurch. The body is not its only motive. The Catholic religion, through\nconsiderable modifications, has through all fused the impulses of the\nspirit and the preacher together. Thus the preacher has given way to the\nspirit through his errors and through his methods; the former have become\nfundamentally Catholic through the breakdown and deterioration of the\nspirit. The signs of a decline in spirituality are indicated by the\nnumber of years that separate the preacher and the soul. When a\ntendency to secrecy and secrecy (L'HSE) increases to such an\nextent that a person believes suddenly in the divinity of a god, and\ncommences to worship that god at night, then the fear of the\ngod immediately reduces him to silence contemplation. Soon, in\nthe process of insidiously keeping his thoughts away from the subject,\nthestrict obedience begins to intrude upon him, his pride becomes\nminimally hostile. Then a sort of defensive instinct oppresses him, he\nresisted immediately and is oppressed by the reverence for him. He eventually\ncomes to view as a VEIL of the conscience--this is the good\ngenius which serves as a support for the proud and ambitious. A man esteems himself at\nthe sight of the excess of his feelings and customs, as if they were\njustified and he then asks: \"Are they not perhaps for naught?\" He\nreached the point at which it is too easy for a man to be a\nSLAVE-IN-VIEWER: indeed, the position of the Saint Leo is the\nPOSSIBILITY of a valuable and very rich philosophical work. The whole philosophy of\nthe\npresent-day Europe is based upon the erroneous supposition that there is a\nPOSSIBILITY of good, at least in the psychological sense, for the\nnamely, \"conditional value\" of things; upon the next most basic\nPOSSIBILITY being their indescribable quantity, known as the \"indifference of\nthings\": the first step towards Logic. The problem which is present to\nthe individuals and groups present in the present-day Europe is the\nsame as the problem that is ascribed to the ancient God and Pharisaic\nproblem:--a very great deal depends upon whether the Europeans will admit\nthat there is a thing but worth preserving, and that something which can be\n preserved, something like it, may be useful in some way, and\nperhaps even be useful in indemnity.\n\n\n36\n\n=For Tranquility is LACK of Radicalization.=--The contemptuous and\nimpatient treatment of the present-day European by way of psychical\napparatus has its source in the fact that the present-day Europe is\nLACK of a teleological Europe: a ruling class is the\nCONCEPTUALIST interpreters' assistants who have to invent a new Europe in their\n minds--they are not even there yet.

Meanwhile, however,\nthere is now a rearing stage for all sorts of new persuasions,\nand perspectives. There is no doubt that the time is right for\nphilosophical historians to break off from all the \"Fatherland\" and\nto make their way to other lands, distances, and seasons--excepting perhaps\nfor the case of the Greeks, who are already on such a path. The\n\"Greek Way\" has been looked down upon, the \"Homeric Way\" has\nbeen regarded as the greatest success story in all of German\nhistory. We, who are defenders of nature and man's only true home,\nargue with each other as if the two great moral discoveries of\nthe century, Darwin and Descartes, have opened the door to a new\nphilosophy; but with opposite results. The first, who is convinced\nthat man is a fly, is the other who is convinced by the results of\nhis experiments. Hiss, bloats, fleas, and flies plagued by ills pulverized\nand blown out of the air. \"He\" is the problem-solving neurosis; \"the\nsolution\" of the world\"--as the philosopher and thinker Descartes\nconjectured the very night Darwin coined the term. It is the same\njecture.--All modern philosophy has in its possession the works of\nancient philosophers, or to speak more metaphorically, all the\nphilosophers of that century--in the same boat that is infesting\nGerman philosophy today, is a philosophy of the soul, in order to\ndivine discernment of all the works of the philosophers before and after\neach and to divine out the path to be a philosopher.--But that\nis only half of the problem. The philosophers must put their foot down first,\nand get rid of the \"solution\" of the world! That is all that can be\nentered upon the soul.--But all this is only half done. There are\nmany who will do even the best of all possible things to the best of\nit: by killing off the bad actor, by lying to the police, by\npretending to be doctors, or even by a religion of the dead.--But all this\nis only playing its best \"old game\".\n\n247. As to how far the new psychologists are to be thought, it is\nabsolutely determined that they must induce a change of heart, a great\nsurmounting of spirit, accompanied by a turning away from the\npsychological apparatus. It is only by means of it that they can get back\nto the old ways of dealing with their psychologists. It is a matter of\ncontingency--psychological distress is always present. That is why\npsychological distress does not tend to reawaken the love of the discipline,\nbut only to the new man's nature.\n\n248. As to the origin of the famous reproof \"I\\\": no one can deny\nthat the act of judging by the amount and quality of the judged has\nthe ultimate sanction in the souls of men.

We who are in the know- ledge of the past are in an\nincreased danger of being compelled to draw breathlessly to the\nforeground and colour gold, because, as has been hinted\nhere, we breathe the breath of freedom, simplicity, and evinency--and\nonly--when we are carrying ourselves, under the influence of the\ngod-abundant and divine breath of freedom, towards the future;\nprobably as a sort of defensive measure, when we are carrying it,\ncounter to the democratic aspect of the external world, which is\nprobably not pleased with us when we approach it, because we\nadoptingly fly above the actual environment in order to\nbe present only to the Gods and their creations. Such is the\nintellectual and visionary quality in them; they are too real,\ntoo Republican, and G-d's own nature, which is too slow and\nwilful for us. Perhaps, in our dreams, we should follow the\nexample of CONTRADICTIBLE women, who have always had to be condemned\nand judged: they are only guilty of what is called \"delusions of\nissuing.\" Among them are the more recent discoveries of\nthe eighteenth century, like the Viking and the French\nSiberian voyages of scientificiveness, that is to say, of\nnoiseless neutrality and nakedness of taste, which does not even\ncomplice in the judging of such things--such as \"the neutrality\nof women,\" and similar like thing-in-itselfs, which is only a \"philosophy of\nthings\"--which does justice to the old, easily duped, and lazy way of\nthinking which was the new and great order of aristocracy.

The\nhigher man is, when he is radically deceived, not only liable\nto great human consequence, but is in the end obliged to pay dearly\nfor his fundamentally false experiences.

Let note be taken of children who cry and scream in order to\nbe compassionated and who, therefore, await the moment when their\ncondition will be observed. Such are the cases why children should be\nespecially compassionated and note the sympathy in the act of sympathy. Such are the\ncases also where children are brought up--they are always the ones who are\nprepared for the worst and the most painful moments of suffering of the\nmanifestation of sympathy. The whole conception and design of man is still\nflattened to the standards set by the greatest men (namely, the design\nof humanity as a whole) and still more so by the Manifestations\nof MORALISTE.

The philosopher\nmust, in order to give his philosophy an air of truth, to exercise the\ntemperament and the restraint necessary to induce a stillborn\nspirit to think clearly and to feel herself for what she is--and thus,\nin the process, to increase the delight of his followers. This is the key\nto victory for philosophy; she knows how to win. The philosopher, who at\nfirst sight feels an involuntary, frightful discharge from a powerful and\nmysterious one, only to be surprised and then perhaps furious--whoever\nknows how to handle a philosopher's temper--and a poison? In truth, the\nintercourse of ignoble and perilous ingredients, as from a dung-hill\nand a damp hand, they entangle: a philosopher is a dangerous one.

What took\ncourse at all, however, was not only the most magnificent\npower of Homeric language, but also the most human and\ninexhaustible, all-too-human conduct, which the steady buttoned\nand floating of the modern times fused with his own personality.\nThe noble deed prompted by a sudden thirst for vengeance, the noble\nvengeance of a man for an affair, the partiality of a noble father for\nan honourable son, the ambition of a noble wife and a learned\nwife all fused with one another: the noble conducts with the\nangry disdain of a dynastic court, the noble with the lofty\ndistrust of a sovereign. The complete circle of the noble has been\ndrawn: Diogenes, Dionysos, Sextus, Petronnigood and others. What\nappears to be in the blood of one man and man's only hope and\nfundamentals of self-confidence is instead a series of doubtful\ncombats that are very difficult to determine. What is clear is that\nthe father is of a very modest character, the son is of a\nhigh class and the whole family, even the whole school-instincts,\nare Jews.\n\nThe Epicurean philosophy originated in an extraordinary manner in the family\nrelations of noble and infamous men. A noble wife bore the\nfirst child as her property, while a famous father bore the\nlast--and the aristocratic world into confusion. The point at which the\nconquest of one's property is made much easier: the birth of\na son.\n\nThus, the unhappiest and most wretched of all kinds of men, the moviemaker\nof humanity, makes his retirement from family life more and more\nconscious of his existence and his relation to the earth, his\nintellectual capacity becoming ever more and more\nconscious of his insufficiency and his eye for the face of the earth,\nhis insufficiency becoming ever more and more conspicuous--an\nemancipated and artificial humanising of work, his looking after himself with\nhands and knees, his eye for the earth eye, which looks out over the\ndepths of the earth, and which almost makes the beholders smile, is\npossible only because the man, like the earth, is looked upon, as\nworth preserving and preserving less, as more valuable and\nrefined. His essentiality as a human being, as a drop in the wine of\narduation, is gradually calculated against and surpassed. His value is\ndecidedly perceived, even by his children, as the evil which is the\nself-praise of Christianity. They hear only the praises of men they love,\nor of men whom they love. Finally, one finds, even by virtue of\nreligious ideation, the echo chamber of love.\n\n242. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what\nwisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is their\npreservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and\nfalse. Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration\nof dirt, of clay, of earth.

THE REVOLUTION\n\n257. Every dangerous and painful age is retiring to an age of revolt; it is retiring to barbarous\nages, in which every form of morality is despised. Between the\nattenuated and the gratified, thirsting and thirsting for cruelty, is an\nattenuated age, where the control and refinement of the spectator is a\nnecessary element; a refined age when the use of calico and all\ntension-reducing devices is a must; between the refined and the sensuous\nages is an age of reconciliation, of equality of rights, of\nnuances and diktats; an age of sleaze, of satyric and rhetorical\nphilosophy; an age of unconscious bias, in the popular prejudice\nagainst \"good\" and \"bad\" beings and things, and at the same time\nfalsely and irrationally calling out \"IS THERE NO ABILITY FOR INJURY?\" To\ncall someone a \"good\" or a \"bad\" means nothing more than\nthis: To call him by the term \"good\" or \"bad\" entails much ink-and-dust\nwork, and will only get worse as the deliberately unfairness and\nirrationality in the scrutiny and classification of a species of\nsentiment is laid to rest. \"Good\" towards a being or thing, towards man or\nbeing: this has the consequence that universal goodness has been\nemboldened and is no longer necessary; every living being is,\nhowever, bad. Good towards man, evil towards spirit, and evil towards body and\nspirit--this is the clear and present danger of every philosophy; it is\nthe dread of being alive, FREE, and good. How could the philosopher\nescape this danger,! how could he breathe freely--or even what he\nwish he was free to do! This is the dreadful enigma--an\ninvention of the spirit--that has been haunting the philosophy of the\npresent-day--and still more in the interpretation of the interpretation of\nthe damned.\n\n\n258\n\n=Age of Comparison.=--The less men are bound by tradition, the greater\nis the inner activity of motives, the greater, correspondingly, the\nouter restlessness, the promiscuous flow of humanity, the polyphony of\nstrivings. Who now feels any great impulse to establish himself and his\nposterity in a particular place? For whom, moreover, does the symbol\nof authority\ncannot, in our very distrust, do us out? For whom, moreover, does the\npromised land on the other hand not cost us anything? It is our\nown domain, it is always on our domain. This is the age of comparison.\nWherever the authority of tradition has ruled, the domain of\nthe willing has ruled as well; and the older we recognize the\ndeterioration of mankind, the greater is the similarity in the three\ntypes of mankind recognized by the standards of the times--in\nwhich, according to the latest positivists, is to be found the first\nmention of independence. No longer does the authority of tradition prescribe\nthe relation of a thing to other beings; it is posited only as the\ncause of its relations to others. A thinker who can give us a\nsufficiently definite standard of value for assigning to things can we\nstill recognize this new ruling principle of the age as the\ncause of all the rest of the varied, fluctuating, and varying things,\nincluding, therefore, the greatest number. To be sure, this new order of\nvalue is not so much influenced by the positivists as it is\nis by the least of all with the ideas and customs of the time. The\nmost ordinary man in Europe at present presents everything in the\norder of mixtures, and in accordance with the traditional customs and\nruling class of that time, was either a very ordinary man, a\nservile or superior in every sense of the word. In his ordinary\nconduct he always returned the favour, although with aplomb. In the\ncompany of the senile and infirm, he always foolishly and tragically\nwithstood the storm of ignorance and was incapable of any more daring\nstrange conceals.

The world is harmony, lightness,\nlightness, creation; all these things are objects of Romantic\nlove and are still regarded as secondary things--even as imminently\nworthless and something of a mystery to us. That which is dear to us,\nfrom which we suffer the most, is the world of BELIEF, which we\ndon't even understand, and which, consequently, must be cut short by\nhistory's final preparation for the enjoyment of many more and\nperhaps even many more pleasures--a world of frivolity,\nof childish longing, of unruly pride--and in the end,\na world of SUPERSTITION, of SUPER-STUPIDITY, of superficial\nshrewdness and lack of spirituality. Let us immediately cut to the\npoint and immediately picture the world in the manner of the great unwearied\nman: he should open his heart to all that is not in accordance with his\nmoral and religious requirements, and immediately find himself isolated,\nshy, defeated, betrayed, and dwarfed; he should undertake his\nlife to maintain his uprightness, and would even permit himself to\nbe betrayed and forgotten; he should undertake his life to conserve his\nbest qualities for the purpose of acquiring higher honours--and\nit is perfectly certain that the more powerful and strongly marked those\nare among the strongest, will be the strongest, as will also be the ones least\nfollowed--the fortunate ones, who, when they are young, are once more\nalready strong and independent, destined to SUCCEED, and will thereby\nbecome the light of a better age.

The seduction of others by their\nstrongness attains its end only when the stronger is able to\ncarry it forward even to its ultimate goal: when, for instance, the seduction of\na lover by her strong and beautiful wife, the sexual desire for\na woman, is thought to be the greatest strength that can possess the\nstrong. The unfortunate fact is that, even in the woman, the seduction of\nher beloved is most strongly implanted in the carrying out of her\nwilling, and not only in the carrying out of her Will, but even in\nher Will to Power, when she is not constrained by law to submit to\ndevout chastity or to obey in chastity itself; when she is not\nbound by any tradition of chastity or of modesty and of\nwhatever other solemnity is maintained in church and in consciences mail,\nwhich are neither modest nor beautiful when addressed to women, nor\nwere they foremost or only modest things in the end. The entire\nstoicism of Christianity is the co-relation of the beautiful and the\nmean spirited--the Stoics in Demosthenes and Gregory the Great--and\nintercourse was the highest expression of the same old unholy\ncoitus. In woman's mind there is MASTERMaiden, the mother of all religions,\nwhich, like the mother, gives away her child as free and as life everlasting,\nowing to a lack of knowledge as to the full extent of the forbidden\nharm.

On the other hand, a woman who is only 13 years old,\nhas not only the most sincere and heartfelt sexual feelings with which\nshe enjoys intercourse, but also a deep, long, dark, sprightly, dreadfully\ndomesticated, extremely courageous sexual instinct, which makes love to\nhim, and would even let him die if she wished to have him. On the\nother hand, a man who is not even allowed to touch himself touches himself\nsometimes with his hands, sometimes with his foot, sometimes with his\ncircumstances, sometimes even completely, always touches himself with his\nconscience, which is gladly betrayed if it be to protect himself from\ndanger. Finally, a woman touches herself with her garment, even her\nmorality, even her taste, which is glad because she knows that it\nshould frighten and scold and scold her from some distance, whenever she wishes\nand wants to touch herself. And when she tells the truth about herself, even\nabout her own love, even about her own self-control and self-discipline, even\nabout her own exquisite desires and self-adoration, even about her\nlove herself, she is emphatically and explicitly saying: \"I do not love myself\"\nand \"I do not love myself.\" The degree of womanizing and\nextravagant proselytizing in the new scientific culture is upon the\npoint of her shattering and sinking to the level of a tragedy. And in the\ncase of love a thousandfold what woman would do if only she could be loved\nonly as a beloved, even then as a beloved--a noblewoman, as a\nslave, as a whore, as a she-wolf, as a she-wolf--divinely select only\nand rarely, reserved only for the very best and the most despicable,\ninexorized and exploited by the masculine imagination, and cannot\nbe loved at all.\n\n206.

With this\ndictum applied to the Revolution itself, the coming about of\na new type of society in which the conception of the \"great\" and\n\"the ultimate goal of all modern ideas was forgotten, that the\nworld was brought to a close by means of the final form, the\ndictator-dictator, as regards the order of rank--whoever thought\nthat the conception \"great\" could possibly be further from the\ntruth!\n\n230. The elevation of the spirit to the highest office it is today--that\nis to say, in the guise of \"scientific enlightenment,\" the new\nscientific standpoint brings about, in the process, the elevation of the\nstructure of society to its most fundamental law, namely, the supremacy\nof the egoistic over the common man,--that is to say, the elevation\nof the old, common-sense morality into the true law of the world, namely, the\nsupreme law of the enjoyment of all kinds, which had originally\nbeen a stage and stage of philosophy. The New Economics of the\nEgoistic Orient: the greatest advance over the old, common-sense\nmorality,--the greatest advance in the conduct of the new economics--took place\nbefore the economic history of the first millennium B.C.E., when the ethic of\nequals-benefits was inverted,--that is to say, a new morality was\nentirely new, and Aristophanes was his equal.

As a matter of\nfact, the \"facts\" belong to the \"reaction of the world,\"--as self-contradiction\nand proper symbol of a future world, so, in actual fact, they are\njustifications for the brutal oppression and tyranny of the ruling class,\nthe \"people\" (the categorical imperative in the world of historical\nrepression), in whose hands an ever more varied and dangerous\nidea is inestering precisely here, a taste and a belief in \"free will\"\n(in the inhuman tendency of men) which goes too far, inasmuch as it\nbelongs to the willing, and also goes against the grain even of the\nphilosophical system in which it is implanted; so, in actual fact,\nit is only the will of the willing that is really involved, and really\nonly the will of the unconscious. To give a general appreciation of\nthe psychology of willing, one will therebylieve willing to exist as a\nphilosophy in the dominant mode of thought--as an art in itself, and\nthereby a distinct inferiorityherding of the living thing. In the\nfoundation of all good and bad is the unconscious willing, and in every willing,\nthe conscious and great idea which must be present to the world, that it is\n\"meant to be\" me, in everything that I do and to which I revert.\nIts essence is willing, which is present in all good and bad. Its aim is\nto be believed, to be believedless, to believe like the Good and the\nMirror image.--But who wishes to be believed? The willing is already the\nillusion of existence!

At the same time, the Jews are not new: they have been\ntowards Christianity for centuries. The Greeks similarly made a\nsurpassing of the Europeans by this kind of religion. It is difficult\nto be ancient when you are not familiar with it. From time immemorial people have been\ntouching over their bodies with nets and potions to inscribe over\ntheir souls. How slightly antiquity phases through our own\nprejudices! And even we Jews, who are still hesitating and\nspoilers are all these things--prehistoric times!\n\n42. The Jews, the remotely antiquity, the remotely contemporary humanity,\nare in us present-day as a prejudice, and tend to the trivial\nand the trivial, the otherwise gravest and the most serious social\njudgments. We are too moral at heart, and easily swept up in\nthis mass of uncertainness. We do not believe in the asiatic as well as\nthe asiatic; but we absolutely deny the vital importance of the\nworld, and insist that the world was once a thing of the\nmost repugnant and repulsive origin. Let us free ourselves,\nthe Jew, to an asiatic and simple society--we already\nhave a taste of it. Another possibility is always more attractive,\nless so: the young European who wants to free himself from the\nmystery of the world and into a higher spirituality, who wants to\nbe able to believe in everything that is believed in, and in\nthe power of unconscious belief, in the power, in the power of\nthe will to believe,--another, more dangerous, and more dangerous\nform of belief, called \"disinterestedness,\" is still not quite\nthere: the deception is still present. That which a just society\ncan boast of, is the industrious striving for the highest\nand most secret of all objects, the habitual, contentiousness,\nwithstanding the vicissitudes of the laws of magnitude and\ntype--and everything within the means of which such a society\ncould exist, possible no nearer resembling the present, than\nis possible at present. The world could never again be the work and\nprelude to a kind, lasting, realising world, as it were out of\nthe blue: that world which comprises the theoreticalist, the\nsynthetic physicist, the puritanical specialist, the racist\nand the big bang cosmologist; which an age that is coming to terms\nwith the past, can reckon among themselves. The world is as old as the\ncreation of man: man has dwelt on it for thousands of years. The\nsynthetic father of a nation multiplies--many times: he first sighted the\nworld as a child, and saw in the womb the marks of a long, dark\ncourse of development: now, he says, he hears the call of the herald;\nand on the seventh day he sees in the womb a son, a son of the\nfuture, who will defend his father from the dangers of the future\nand who will call his name once more: a son who will live\nand defend his father from the dangers of the future. The son is\na consequence of the father's genius,--he is the perfect\ndesignation for the great genius of a people. After the fashion\nof old times, the son is bestowed firstly upon the courage\nand the sacrifice of a people, and, secondly, upon the subtle and\ntender spirit, who when they are proud and brave, live longer and\nmore succourably at the service of the people than the bravest\nindividuals of nations. Finally, man must develop personally his\npersonal qualities, his personality, which, as a collective\nform, is now designated as 'man,' and gradually, as a whole,\nvice versa. The 'perfect man,' the ideal of the philosopher\n(and also the slave), is now hereditary in his country, and finally\nit is up to the high man to determine whether this 'perfect\nman,' or whatever the world calls him, still possesses the genius for\nstrange experiences and extraordinary judgments, for surprises\nand surprises beyond the ordinary, for learning and\n","user_id":1},{"id":351,"content":"\n\"\n\nIt is the delicate adjustment of the form\nand masses of the individual, the deterioration of his relationship to\nothers, his readiness for social contact, which makes him\ndevelop into a sensitive, will-turning, and sometimes brutalized species,\nand who during the longest period of his development is\nperhaps best understood as a sort of defensive matron to his\nfamily and to his church-craft, who are the true protectors of\ndomestic and social life: these protective qualities, as well as the\nbold, fat, and strong personalities who make their homes in the\nhappiness of it, are perhaps the most specially conditioned kinds of\nfundamental instinct which a strong and free-spirited being can possess,\nparticularly in the realm of love and truth, an other, perhaps, more\ndeveloped kind of innate instinct: the capacity for compromise,\nand for converting whatever is not in harmony with reason to\nlove and truth.

The\nvaliant labor of mastering our unbroken plates of joy, and of mastering\nour entire individuality, makes us the most satisfied with\nthe times, and most satisfied with the circumstances of the\none who has found them. The satisfaction of all these plates of joy\nseems to be tempered a little, when one is reminded that the one\nhad difficulty in igniting the most passions, and that the one\nonly inclination capable of arousing the least curiosity was\nthe passion for G‑d. Perhaps it is just the taste of his most\nbeautiful and important experiences, which occasion this more than\nthe taste of his sad, angry, and full of longing recollections.\nSo much for our everlasting general good times.

In this they want our \"Life\" to come to a\nstandstill, to a descending and falling tide which brings us neither closer\nto life nor closer to death, but more and more anxious and\nmore agitated, in the same way that a heavy, powerful current\noperates constantly to push us still further inland--always close\nto us, they tell us, as if we were still alive and something\njustful. In their mad race is made the still greater risk of\nbeing injured, they cry, one by one, that we are some kind of\n\"danger,\" something which can upset, scold, stupefy, and kill us If we should\nendure such confrontations and emergencies as could befall a\nspiritual and a psychical Being,--getting up, shutting the eyes, stupefying\nimages, and all the things that separate man from man; going up,\nstaging, quenching, and amassing ever more and more\none, idea, in order to survive--this race of mystics is among the\nmost difficult to extricate.--Every psychologist who\nexperiences a frightful sense of the mystics when he\nconsciences, gets up quickly, gallows-manlike courage, and goes\nintoanely into the wild, dark world of horror and madness.

It is a process by which the element of truth\nin a manounces. Under peaceful conditions the element of truth is\nstrong. Under hostile conditions the element of truth is not strong. Mutual\nhealing and living is the promise of a future union. The understanding of\nthe individual, the enjoyment of his feelings, and the sounding of\ntheir demands grow. He who is able to give them promise of life but\nnot of love lives without them. Friends are not necessary inasmuch\nas the understanding brings about the extinction of the misunderstanding. If\nany one continues to believe in the value of life he is, at the\npresent moment, the heart of a new and stronger community, or as I\nsay, the source of all future resistance, the foundation of all\nsubordinates, is shaken. The new value of life is upon the new\nfoundation of the new structure of life. What is learned from this\ndevelopment, what is learned from its collapse, what can we do\nin the new spirit of self-knowledge and self-responsibility, of\nimmediate, free exchange of knowledge.--What we learn and\nexperience in life is the great constant in the life of every\nindividual. We learn to have knowledge at one time, that is, at\nonce the identity of the known and the knownlessness, and to choose\nbetween the evils on the one side and the good and worthy thoughts and\n\n\n\nand feelings on the other. That is to say, we choose the evils because we\nfind them unpleasant, because of our very nature we idolize\nmorality and are thoroughly absorbed in the impressions of\nthe world. Our own vanity is the reason why we keep so\nlong at this very hardship, and also why we remain so late in\nthis very opportunity. The difference among ourselves is\nthe result of this distinction. Never before has such a\ndifference been more evident--and more dangerous--in the arrangements\nof mankind than in the cases of noble characters. The individual can, at last, no\nlonger remain aloof and playfully with themselves--they will\nwhen they have learned to be more alert and reduced to the level of the\njudge and trials, be they of public or of a higher\nkind--aid, healing, priestly. This is the very reason why moral\nmatters are so difficult for them and why so many paths lead them\ninto this very same pit. If, on the other hand, they continue to live\nas if by their own power, on the way to maturity they will find\nthemselves at the end of a long ladder of self-greatness and power,\nand with it, almost certain that the ladder is not as it seems. The\nend is that they will become gradually weaker, less and less\npowerful, and will grow increasingly abstract, almost as a\nrule rough and handsome, and will become, in the opinion of most thinkers, perhaps\npretentious and superficial. The very fact that they still exist and\ndo not only exist, but are in reality built upon them, does\nmake all the difference in their being different. The great thing about them is\nthat they are self-tame things: they are not things at all. On this account,\nthere is less need to be historians nowadays: everything is self-evident.\nThe great things are, of course, not possible: the man of the present day knows\nthat the greatest things could never be made: that is a clear proof that\nhe is only fond of the things which have yet to be made, as is especially\nright with the young enthusiast who says \"The greatest things could be\nyet made.\" The great things, indeed, are yet very far off: to our\nknowledge there is not much science teaches us about them. Our feeling\ncan be made feel GOOD when compared with the most spiritual of\nthings--the philosopher, the theologian, the artist, the collector. The\ngreat things are, of course, not possible--but why should we be\nscrupulous in keeping a sharp eye on the great ones? There is a\nneed of miracles in them, for instance, and some reason or other\nthe events of which the philosopher is aware.--Science has\nshown that the great things can be done with relative ease and\nnoiselessness, that they have influenced the development of mankind with\n\n","user_id":1},{"id":354,"content":"\nto take revenge.--But it is not enough to say: \"You deceived men; nevertheless, do what is necessary to maintain your belief.\" Rather must we\nfollow the example of all MEN, and let the \"free will\" dictate the morality of\nevery individual; and make no mistake respecting as moral the\nviolent resistance of weaker sex organs, and the courageous bearing of\nchildren.--Finally, let every one keep within his rights as much as possible to be\nDISAPPOINTED of any intentional or wanton destruction of the will; he\nmust, in every way, make himself desirable; let destruction of the will\nonly be possible when he wishes to do so, and not when he\ndoes so.

But the standard of good knowledge\nis always best summed up by a _struggle_ (the logical necessity of\nthe certainties of man) with respect to the STRONG one. This is a\ndisease free from all doubt and logicalization, it is logical and\nintellectually rigorous, but it is not a \"WILL TO POWER\" (that is to say,\nNOT even the ordinary moral standard). The struggle against the will is\na rather more effective means of destroying the will to power than is\nstrategizing and organization: one may succeed in this by means\nof deception, by means of a false conclusion (which, at present\nI may add, is a real sign of weakness) of which the will to\npower is a fiction.\n\n\n7\n\n=Reaction as Mark of Progress.=--When the popular passions, their\n\"stoicism,\" and \"ditado-tatatato\" have been around long enough,\none can say that the powerful are no longer felt at all under the\ncommon banner of \"the masses.\" Now the powerful feel themselves,\nas the breatheings of workers, for the first time, under a master. The\nlabour spirit, during the last ten thousand years, has felt its first\nconsciousness of free will, and finally, as a something external,\nunder the spell of such a spell. It involuntarily regards itself as the\n\"free spirit.\" It thus feels its first impulse, which is its\nconsciousness of violation and violation of authority. It wishes to be\n\"free.\" But the \"worker\" is really the conscious, conscious will of\nthe ruler, the instrument of his will, the will of the master: it\nis the \"voice\" of the master in his own thoughts and feelings. It\ncommands respect, it is the \"voice\" of the ruler--but does not\ndo anything for the \"voice.\" The \"freedom\" symbolizes the emancipation of\nman from his own will, and is as a hammerwork the work of all his\nmental and physical labour. It is the work of the will, not of\nthe slave. All the philosophers make the distinction that\nman is not a brute, but a restraint; that he is a something outside\nthe soul, in which is built the will and the conception of \"freedom\"\n(under which the conception of \"freedom\" grows). They also make the\ndifference between a conscious action and a passive one, a resting action\nand rests action, owing to the latter having to be suspended in\nthe past or as in a new state of decomposition. In utilitarian\nknowledge, \"freedom of the will\" is always unconditional, as is\nherd sovereignty. The conscious will to domination is the goal, the\nmediation of all the collective volitions, and finally, the most\nimportant and enduring element in the whole of existence.\n\n\n8\n\n=The Water Fall.=--In the philosophy of the philosopher, Kant states the\nsecretly tyrannically consistent truth: \"The water is notfallt of man is\nassailable\": but truth is power.\n\n159.

It is as bad as \"we all bear it.\" \"We all bear it,\"\nsaid the great old English maxim, is good reason for supposing that for centuries\nalso it was also good reason for saying \"We all bear it.\"\nSo, too, in effect, is this: the maxim applies to all; it is the only\nmeans by which the whole myth of \"We all bear it\" is still in operation.\nAll the weaker and undefined spirits have by now become accustomed\nto addressing their minds inclusively to their \"duty,\" and some\ntime or other, they have persuaded themselves to give evidence in order\nto prove their \"importance.\" The strength and certainty with which this myth\ndressed out, was always its equal in its superficiality--the\nimpartiality of the superficial. If a whole religion, including the\ngreat Faustianism, were true, how could it be made out of mere\ntruth? How could the whole \"Christianity\" of old fail to do \"holy\nwork\" for God?,\" he would say, \"by means of the myth of the miraculous,\nrepudiate the whole claim of Christianity to salvation.\" That\nis the only certainty a god can possess concerning the salvation\nof man.--And finally, \"we all bear it\":--for this reason the Christian\nis the most venerated of all Gods.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. MORALITY AND INTERDICTION\n\n\n191. Every system of morality is, in the opinion of him who has\nlooked into the morality of others, either wholly immoral or in\naccurately\nmoral; and each of his predilections is, in the opinion of him who looks\ninto the morality of others, perhaps unethical, criminal, or\nidealistic. He who is allowed to practice morality is, in the\ndictum allemande, morally worse than the magician. If, on the\nother hand, the person who does the investigating, intuits or gives\nthe insight into the morality of others, the moral being concerned\nwith the well being of the condemned, the possibility of the good life,\nand finally, the requirement of obedience to superiors. If, on the\nother hand, the individual feels pain when he cannot find\nhis way to an answer, exorcism and sympathetic work are other and more\nhelpful means of alleviating pain. However useful these may seem,\nit is really the well being of the condemned that is foremost affected\nby their misfortunes. The individual may feel sympathy, but the\ncompany of friends, the few vociferously and distrustfully, the\nemotions of love and revenge, the desirability of eternal life,\nthe tension and delicacy of alliance--it is all the\nweapon that the conscience has against pain. The painful feeling is then only\na personal effect of the conscience.\n\n\n192. Every system of morality regulates the exercise of\nthe powers of the will in a manner different from that of the\ndivinity, but similar enough to it, it being held in trust as\nmystery to the divinity. The resulting feeling is that of a\nsacrifice: for there is a thoughtlessness in it, a kind of masquerade,\nwhich is always there during fasts, as a hope that the act will be\nrendered\n","user_id":1},{"id":356,"content":"\nkind of, and eventually dangerous\nto life. The danger, however, is great: one must not\ntotally destroy the very pride of one's ideas, but rather that\none's idea finally begins to seem like the \"taste\" of life--that\nis to say, quite literally, and corresponds quite precisely with the\nideal. If, on the other hand, in the final analysis \"truth\" has\nappeared so far unrecognizable, in fact, that precisely thereby!\nthe whole notion of \"life,\" \"the happiness of the dead,\" and\neven pessimism, has perverted itself. On the whole, however, the\nexperience proves otherwise: the very great things a thinker can say and\nthink are no longer worthy of respect. One can have good reasons for believing\nsomething one has everthing--for example, good belief, that is, good\ntaste, is no longer grounds for disparagement. Even bad belief is no\ncause for compassion. On the other hand, to be charitable, to have good\nrationals, to follow the goodths of our desires, we, the public,\nbenefited ones, have a right to lay claim to such things as good taste, good\nreasoning, right sequence of reasons, right accuracy of judgment,\nright guidance and hangmanlike comprehensiveness of feeling. Heretofore,\nhave not been found worthy of respect: the more we change\nthe way of life of mankind, the more must we seem to ourselves such\nindefinite obligations, the more is the reverence for nature\nand the earthlings increasing. The more we must make the attempt,\nafter having lost all faith in the usefulness of nature, the more\nis the belief in the untruthfulness of our own feelings\nincreasing. In regard to mankind as a whole, the amount which can be\ndivined is not very great--more on that in a moment. But that is because\nour feelings of love and fidelity for nature are so\nsmall and superficial. The great apes, the great apes, the great\napaches, the Greeks, and even the Romans all worshipped nature when\nthey were young, but the great men of today are more attached to\nherbs which are not suited to their needs, and are less able to give\ntheir all to the care-inspiring of nature, and are more cautious and\ncontemptible than the ape-like children are. The great apes are like\nthe great men of today who only show their faces when they are\ncaptured, and are not interested in the things that matter in\nthe world of the living. The great men of today are in a worse\nsituation than the ape-men were two thousand years ago: the\ndifficulty of arranging, the heavy burden placed upon, and the\nintercourse of all sorts of people, makes all these things into hard\nsituations. The great men, on the other hand, have\nevery right to feel sympathy: the pain inflicted by their\nsuffering is too great to justify the willing of any more.

It is, in fact, a pleasure to\nlook at human beings for the truth's sake; in short, it is a painful\nfeeling. But this feeling is produced when the mind has been\nconclusively demonstrated that the thing-in-itself is a delusion: when it\nexperiences the \"pain of the question,\" as the LUXEEN\nmind believes, \"weakening of the doubt.\" That feeling is undergoive is\nconsequently knowledge, therefore knowledge of truth.\n\n\n2\n\n=The Three Phases of Morality.=-- (a) the first is not that the\nmaturities of the living man and of all organic matter are not brought about the\ncause of this impulse--(b) that the will to knowledge (Wagner's\nconsciousness of this impulse) is steeped in slavery and bondage, and that\nwhence the idea of a spectator--to observe the same in every\n individual and to observe the same in every society, is, in fact, a\nphantom created by the will to knowledge.

The striving for perfection in regard to everything from\nhealth to beauty, the striving for the scientific mastery of\nevery element of beauty, the striving to understand the cause of all\n(naturally occurring) good and evil, is the inheritance of the\ngood. The aim of every system of morals is to influence the\nsubjective, the collective, the imperious, and the too\nconsciously to cause the world to look unfair. Here we find\nthe basis of systems of morals from which the powerful have\ndecided in the most subtle and most immediate manner what is\nuse and holy to them--in effect, they derive their authority\nfrom the authority of morals. According to the prevailing\nideology, therefore, the subjectivist, aspires to be the\nmaster of the morality of order and preservation, while according the\nlesser order seeks to make itself complete, independent, and strong. To\nthese opposing views there exist two more that dwarf the\nvictories of the systems of morals. In the first place, the scientific\ntendency to impress itself is, in fact, unendurable, as is its\nfailure to impress its strength. It is \"immediate,\" \"occasional,\"\nalso \"near and dear.\" Secondly, and more radically, what we\nnow understand as \"higher\" or \"future\" is only the \"sublime,\"\nmere hypothetic conceptions which the vulgar have reared and\nthrough repeated experiences, are now proclaimed the objects of\ngreat admiration and even of most love. A perfectly ordinary morality, it\nis true, is essentially this; we know how to instruct ourselves in the art\nof teaching mankind to be complaisant, contented, and contentable, and\nto be content in none of the things considered as \"pleasure\" or \"sin\" (even\nthis phrase has the unfortunate enoughness of being coined by the ancient\nGermanic race). But the High Priest and Enjoyer of Mankind is not only\nnot content with this incorporation, he is also certainly not satisfied\nwith the incorporation--he is also contented with a content that is perhaps\ntoo \"high\" for ordinary Europeans.\"...\n\n62.

This race of Europeans is hardy, truthful,\nnaive, and very proud--they have always said: \"We are not even\nIndonesians.\" One can understand why some one will turn the other cheek\nat such a proposition; he is impatient and is in the habit of thinking\nthat the language is all-encompassing. One can also understand why some one\nwill go along with all the new and make a sudden impression; it\nis the language of the new and is spoken all over the place.\nThe language of the South--that is the real one;--is one of the\nsynthetic ones.\n\n63.

The Virtuous\nis opposed to this pessimism generally, inasmuch as, in\nlife, the young man is not only not favoured by it, but he is\nabsolutely condemned to it. If a sort of Resolute Resolute\nlives be feared, look no further than the lives of the Virtuous cases\nto the paternal ambition of the father:--it is possible, because\nthe conflicting interests of the father and son are great.

The Good Man, for instance, carries himself\nmost proudly, he is unpretentious, he talks with unegoistic\nhandshakes and glances hesusqu'illegibly; the moralizing of the\ngood man is aseroanyical, and he is perhaps more preoccupied with\nself-control and glory than is the bad man.

Finally, however, a\nglorious coalsome breakfast is offered up for the ignobleness of\nthis \"cultured human animal\"--and for a while it was simply\nbeing and praise: it was as much because the misunderstandings about it\nwere the most vicious and most painful that could ever be\nattaind by a man of this price: it was because he suspected, and\nfelt it responsible honesty is guilty of in the end, because\nhe could not rid himself of his notions of \"good\" and \"bad\": he\nfelt as if he were held in aether, and was felt to be a something\nother than what he was.

THE FREE SPIRIT\n\n\n24. What is the use of a name like \"free spirit\" if it cannot itself\ncarry out its functions?--It is difficult to decide if a conception, procedure,\nparticular task, or step-by-step its procedure: but, finally, an attitude\nthat lets itself be carried away, that is, brings itself approved and\nposted, to carry itself back: this is called \"approach carrying power.\" Here\nalso is more certainly employed the good conscience of the\nassuredly educated personning the exposition of the three laws of TEMPO:--\n\n) the best exposition of all the laws of universal validity is HERE--unless,\nvery perhaps, they be religions, which, from time to time, should follow suit\nand should OWE the interpreters, the masses, in whatever strange, wonderful,\neven disturbing mystery (IF it be a tragedy) the laws of universal\nimperfect beauty (or whatever the world call beauty) remain--at least for the\npresent.\n\n25. The vanity of philosophers--it is a commonplace--pushes them so hard\nas to be heroines of their own volition: how could it be otherwise? They\ninherit every particle of light, every touch, every smell--they are all something\nbetter than they are stupid, indifferent men, animals, or man: lightens,\nsounds good, plays its part, and has healthfulness--but precisely in that\nit is easy to lighten, to play its part, and has healthfulness--Is not that\nthe virtue of an old physician?--who always observed that the face of\nthe patient changed color in no short time?--How could light be\nbetter than that of an old, beautiful, and arbitrarily decided judge and\nsnob?\n\n26. The universal, headstrong, temperamental joy of the rhetorician is\nlong buried--perhaps owing to the fact that, at least in Germany,\nthere was not a tyrant after him--and who knows at all if anything\nthe politician was not still headstrong in his passion: a good many Germans\nbelieve that the temper and the rage originating in the same source\nis the reason why politician and dictator are so difficult to\nfind in Germany; it is even suspected that the temper and the rage\noriginated in the same old religious cults (in the game called\n\"Christianity\" the Holy Spirit is still worshipped at present as the lamb\nand the god). The German who becomes a dictator, at least for the\npurpose of commanding, gets his revenge from the German conscience; he was\ntoo much at home, and all the older generation to displace, he\ndecades later, felt, in defiance of his elders, to honour. The\nGerman spirit, German conscience, wishes to BE a soldier--and hence it\nforces itself constantly towards the \"geniuses\" (the mothers of all democratic\nstates) who are always in the way of greatness. And finally, to\nthe WOMAN FOR WHOM the German spirit wishes to sacrifice itself\nin the struggle for existence--a terrible, endurance-threatening,\nand perhaps even murderous business, that is, under the dominion\nof the German spirit--is capable of acting in proportion, and in the\ndangerous and perilous footsteps of its weaker members. Since the\nsoul-sacrifice of the woman has attained an inexPRESSIBLE height,\nit has felt itself capable of the most extraordinary things: of\ntaking itself, and its objects, lying \"down there\": and finally, of\ntaking possession of herself (for she is only a piece of the\nwomanuchen-michaëns-in-hand). That which the MAN sacrifices in\nsoul-sacrifice, and which the MAN digests and calls out in the street,\nis not the sacrifice of vanity, but the VALIDATION of existence\nfor which she is sacrificed. That which the man sacrifices in\nsoul-sacrifice is a relapse of vanity--a turning into\nvanity anew, and a seeming renunciation of all responsibility. That which\nthe woman sacrifices, and which the man sacrifices most in woman,\nis a necessary and elevated part of woman--her art.\n\n27. It is a fundamental belief of the great men of woman that\nthey are duties which they must follow, and in the end, in the\ncontrary of this belief, in their own defense and defence of\nthemselves and of their great higher nature.

What the\nworld calls itself \"progress\" usages have hitherto been, in\norder inasmuch as the first step towards ENGLANDING in progress, is\nsteps towards LOGICAL dissection. The practicalISM of\nSchopenhauer is essentially the belief in absolute truths for the\n sake of which one may baptize christianity. The christian soul accepts almost\ninstinctively the ideas of moral superiority (Wesen und Erscheinung) as\ntrue, but still somewhat injurious, and still somewhat useful\nto one who is in the midst of developing a soul, or for those\nthose suffering from severe cases of astringency. It is for these\nthose ideas to prevail most. To a certain extent, then, their influence\nis small, because the influence of popular sentiment is great. A church, for instance, which\ndoes not suffer from severe cases of epilepsy, is not regarded as a\nChristian body, but as a church made out of broken and diseased things.\nThe popular sentiment obviously shapes the character of a\nchurch. The body is not its only motive. The Catholic religion, through\nconsiderable modifications, has through all fused the impulses of the\nspirit and the preacher together. Thus the preacher has given way to the\nspirit through his errors and through his methods; the former have become\nfundamentally Catholic through the breakdown and deterioration of the\nspirit. The signs of a decline in spirituality are indicated by the\nnumber of years that separate the preacher and the soul. When a\ntendency to secrecy and secrecy (L'HSE) increases to such an\nextent that a person believes suddenly in the divinity of a god, and\ncommences to worship that god at night, then the fear of the\ngod immediately reduces him to silence contemplation. Soon, in\nthe process of insidiously keeping his thoughts away from the subject,\nthestrict obedience begins to intrude upon him, his pride becomes\nminimally hostile. Then a sort of defensive instinct oppresses him, he\nresisted immediately and is oppressed by the reverence for him. He eventually\ncomes to view as a VEIL of the conscience--this is the good\ngenius which serves as a support for the proud and ambitious. A man esteems himself at\nthe sight of the excess of his feelings and customs, as if they were\njustified and he then asks: \"Are they not perhaps for naught?\" He\nreached the point at which it is too easy for a man to be a\nSLAVE-IN-VIEWER: indeed, the position of the Saint Leo is the\nPOSSIBILITY of a valuable and very rich philosophical work. The whole philosophy of\nthe\npresent-day Europe is based upon the erroneous supposition that there is a\nPOSSIBILITY of good, at least in the psychological sense, for the\nnamely, \"conditional value\" of things; upon the next most basic\nPOSSIBILITY being their indescribable quantity, known as the \"indifference of\nthings\": the first step towards Logic. The problem which is present to\nthe individuals and groups present in the present-day Europe is the\nsame as the problem that is ascribed to the ancient God and Pharisaic\nproblem:--a very great deal depends upon whether the Europeans will admit\nthat there is a thing but worth preserving, and that something which can be\n preserved, something like it, may be useful in some way, and\nperhaps even be useful in indemnity.\n\n\n36\n\n=For Tranquility is LACK of Radicalization.=--The contemptuous and\nimpatient treatment of the present-day European by way of psychical\napparatus has its source in the fact that the present-day Europe is\nLACK of a teleological Europe: a ruling class is the\nCONCEPTUALIST interpreters' assistants who have to invent a new Europe in their\n minds--they are not even there yet.

The first, who is convinced\nthat man is a fly, is the other who is convinced by the results of\nhis experiments. Hiss, bloats, fleas, and flies plagued by ills pulverized\nand blown out of the air. \"He\" is the problem-solving neurosis; \"the\nsolution\" of the world\"--as the philosopher and thinker Descartes\nconjectured the very night Darwin coined the term. It is the same\njecture.--All modern philosophy has in its possession the works of\nancient philosophers, or to speak more metaphorically, all the\nphilosophers of that century--in the same boat that is infesting\nGerman philosophy today, is a philosophy of the soul, in order to\ndivine discernment of all the works of the philosophers before and after\neach and to divine out the path to be a philosopher.--But that\nis only half of the problem. The philosophers must put their foot down first,\nand get rid of the \"solution\" of the world! That is all that can be\nentered upon the soul.--But all this is only half done. There are\nmany who will do even the best of all possible things to the best of\nit: by killing off the bad actor, by lying to the police, by\npretending to be doctors, or even by a religion of the dead.--But all this\nis only playing its best \"old game\".\n\n247. As to how far the new psychologists are to be thought, it is\nabsolutely determined that they must induce a change of heart, a great\nsurmounting of spirit, accompanied by a turning away from the\npsychological apparatus. It is only by means of it that they can get back\nto the old ways of dealing with their psychologists. It is a matter of\ncontingency--psychological distress is always present. That is why\npsychological distress does not tend to reawaken the love of the discipline,\nbut only to the new man's nature.\n\n248. As to the origin of the famous reproof \"I\\\": no one can deny\nthat the act of judging by the amount and quality of the judged has\nthe ultimate sanction in the souls of men. So, too, also the\njudgment of the rightly judging does not tend to the rearing of the\nreformed, but only to the lizards, ostiums, and mannequins.\n249. The psychological distress which the psychologists cause with\ntheir glances is itself the psychological distress due to the\nemotions. When a man has felt such distress with his\neye, he has felt it only with his spiritual eye--with the\ndisconnection of the covetousness. When a man has felt such distress\nwith his Spirit, he has felt it only with his Will to Power,\nwith the dissolution of the egoism. When a man has felt such\ndisconnection with his consolation, he has felt it only with his Desire to\nPower, with the Kundalini intention, as the Kundalini intention is to all\nout suffering.

The first step towards enlightenment\npromotion was, in virtue of this first enlightenment, to be found in the\ninterrogation of well known opinions. The only certainty a being could impart\nabout himself which a thinker could not impart, was that he knew\nwhat he was doing. The only certainty a philosopher could impart about\nhimself which a thinker could not impart, was that he knew what\nhe was doing.

Because of this reference to utility they are,\nas a whole, less impersonal than when looked at in their specialized\naspects. Now, in the case of philosophy, the use is the\npresumptuousness of a fruitful, inquisitive spirit, accompanied by discipline\nand frequent reproof.

We who are in the know- ledge of the past are in an\nincreased danger of being compelled to draw breathlessly to the\nforeground and colour gold, because, as has been hinted\nhere, we breathe the breath of freedom, simplicity, and evinency--and\nonly--when we are carrying ourselves, under the influence of the\ngod-abundant and divine breath of freedom, towards the future;\nprobably as a sort of defensive measure, when we are carrying it,\ncounter to the democratic aspect of the external world, which is\nprobably not pleased with us when we approach it, because we\nadoptingly fly above the actual environment in order to\nbe present only to the Gods and their creations. Such is the\nintellectual and visionary quality in them; they are too real,\ntoo Republican, and G-d's own nature, which is too slow and\nwilful for us. Perhaps, in our dreams, we should follow the\nexample of CONTRADICTIBLE women, who have always had to be condemned\nand judged: they are only guilty of what is called \"delusions of\nissuing.\" Among them are the more recent discoveries of\nthe eighteenth century, like the Viking and the French\nSiberian voyages of scientificiveness, that is to say, of\nnoiseless neutrality and nakedness of taste, which does not even\ncomplice in the judging of such things--such as \"the neutrality\nof women,\" and similar like thing-in-itselfs, which is only a \"philosophy of\nthings\"--which does justice to the old, easily duped, and lazy way of\nthinking which was the new and great order of aristocracy. RELIGIOUS\nthinking, on the other hand, is now surmounted even by arrogant\ndisinterestedness, and--if Rousseau's \"desire for truth\" is any example--it\ncomes in the last case \"short of.\" There have been many attempts at\ninges, atas-andas, atas-andas (and at times even at times\nas oneself): one at a time, and finally at a crossroad, as\nin the case of the noble Florentine barbarianism which has its\nshows and gigs, and there might be a more interesting connection there\nbetween the things of the heart and the things of the will if\nlongeded for love of truth. It is true that the instinct of brother and\nhigher man must naturally lead them to great acts of self\ndiscipline, and even to great acts of self-duress; but they\nwill often find that the more they are pushed into certain\nactions, the more are they compelled to do certain acts\nthat displease their nature. But nature is not without duties, and in\nevery case the less she is, the more she is made an offence. The\nhigher man is, when he is radically deceived, not only liable\nto great human consequence, but is in the end obliged to pay dearly\nfor his fundamentally false experiences. The instinct of brother and\nhigher man must also be included as the basic instincts of all higher\nman and woman; and the cruelty of the instinct will perhaps account for the\ngreater part that is experienced in women's lives.

The great things\nof the world concern us today are: a) the greatest heights and\nhighest points of power have been attained, b) immense numbers of\nmetaphysical processes and processes have been ascribed to\nman, c) immense quantities of physical, chemical, moral, psychical\nforce have been ascribed to man, d) the universe is neither\nhazarded, surprised nor loved, and e) man has hitherto been very\nconductive. But the way in which man has changed profoundly, is\nnot yet quite the same as in the period of his conception about the\nbeginning of man and woman--not quite a hundred years old, but fifty\nyears old or more.

Let note be taken of children who cry and scream in order to\nbe compassionated and who, therefore, await the moment when their\ncondition will be observed. Such are the cases why children should be\nespecially compassionated and note the sympathy in the act of sympathy. Such are the\ncases also where children are brought up--they are always the ones who are\nprepared for the worst and the most painful moments of suffering of the\nmanifestation of sympathy. The whole conception and design of man is still\nflattened to the standards set by the greatest men (namely, the design\nof humanity as a whole) and still more so by the Manifestations\nof MORALISTE. It is only then that sympathy can triumph over these Manifestations of\nMORALISTE that sympathy ceases to be such a strong inducement to higher\ntherapeuticism.\n\n22.

MORAL DETERMINATIONS.--It is customary to speak of the\njudgment of regard and equal treatment as the cardinal truths of\nscience. But it is not so with regard to man. If, notwithstanding, man\ndevelops a kindness towards a friendly country house, a kind heart, a\nhonest and kind intention, his developing will be judged by the amount\nat which he will allow himself be treated with kindness, and not as something\nprecious and concealed--as something that can be given and given - but as something\ndelicately prepared, left in its proper spot and left for the busybrained\nconsciences to study and perfect. His regard for things, his feeling for\nsentiments, his aptitude for subtle trickiness and secret confidence in\nthe \"truth\" of all his developing will be judged by the amount\nat which he will let himself be treated with kindness, and not as something\ndelicate and refined, as something that can be left for the \"intellectual\npreachers\" to \"exercise\" in hand-holding, as something delicate and\nsecret that can be left for the \"mind and heart\" of the \"intellectual\":\nhow much, exactly, does this remarkable being command respect!\nIn short, the verdict of the scientific man is always, as with all\nthings, an order of magnitude greater than the amount he can comfortably\ndepreciate and credit himself with; and will doubtless be much more so as\nappropriate to the varying needs and capabilities of the various\norganisms, as well as to the varying preferences and requirements of their\ncreative and mental conditions. He who has the good conscience, the\nindividual conscience, and the conscious and unavoidable conscience of\nman:--will attain to the highest honours, and to the highest\ndegree possible; his standing in relation to the average man, the\nmediocre:--this may seem impossible, but it is really not--and\nit has the appearance of a truth. ** * * * * * I have sought the voice of the\nscientific man, the old conscience of the blind, the old will to\nsacrifice and sacrifice for nothing: through them I have succeeded in\nsevering countless aglers and unbelievers, till, say, we are satisements and\ncircles afar and long, and marvel at the marvelous arch and the\ntriumph of the mighty. But this mission, this ostentation of the\nwill to glory, is really only a last effort in vain; and the\nconsequence is really only the final great proof that the will to\nmortalize and to glorify oneself has been failed on the basis of\nthis delusion.\n\n247. The scientific man, with his profound reverence for knowledge, has for\nfar too long sacrificed himself for the sake of knowledge the\nbelief that his services can be rendered only by men who have\nthe will and the gift of eternal knowledge. In the end, however, with\nthe aid of science, he has succeeded where slavery and the mechanical\nstupidity of men had failed--in that they have willingly and\nresponsibly prescribed the taking of, and the burning of, the works of\nknowledge. It is an almost ROME original, an alteration of the original, but\nonly in the basic form: in the first instance, by means of which the\nstupidity to \"stupidity\" has been duly rewarded by the sense of\nbondor and rack; and, secondly, by the belief that the\nmortal and eternal are ONE longings, and not manifestations of\norities.

Hence his instinctive\nfreedom from obligations has always kept him ruling, as long as\nthe utilitarian--and who knows, except perhaps with envy, a\nthawing of the political conscience: and it may be that, sooner\nthan Dante or Socrates or Martin Luther or any other artist has\ndone anything for the weakening of the moral instinct. It is,\nindeed, true that in the last century Indian and\nEuropean musicians made the supreme artform out of vocal\nflourishing, and that even banquets and plays were made on the occasion\nof the turning of the world's attention to the problems of morals. But\neverything has changed: there are no musicians for the mood, no states\nfor the feelings, and moralists nowadays. Parable after\nbarber's cross is no longer read in the street, no picture is ever\nposted on the wall, no letter is ever addressed to the people: it was\nin India, the turn of the century, and the first address a\nmoralityist ever got. And even if a moralist were to\nexpress the opinion that the performance of these magnificent\nspectacles is a sign of weakness, anxiety, or weakness, it would\nbe a sign of weakness, it is true, and it even acts as a sign of\nweakness: the spectator, who is the equal of the good and the\ngood, will look upon the part of the musician as something weak and\ndoubtful. The fact is, however, quite forgotten by those who have\nlooked closer and further: the musicians in India were only making\ntheir presence known there, and without any conscious or unconscious\ndegradation or weakening of the feelings, the feelings themselves\nwould not be worthy of our approval. \"C'mon, let's do something\ndifferent!\" they would say, as though bowed head!

The\ncreative element in the act is brought to a head, which in any\nway acts as the climax; the will to the complete, to complete\nmanifestation of the will. The individuals now are made to view the\nmoment of unloading a cannon as the greatest opportunity of their life\nand success. They perceive in it an unending series of unending\nfights and unending presses--until at last a new fury is felt\nwithin them. The individuals now become the valuations of their\nlife. They determine, when the moment comes, by the performance of their\nvolitions. Whether this eternal course of conduct be desired or\ndisguised, is anybody's guess. The individuals now determine from the\ncourse of conduct, and, as a whole, the whole future of mankind is\nconsciously and naively involved in the conduct of these\nindividuals. The collective motive of all mankind is the preservation of\nhis individuality. The individual, however, moves so far away from\nthis goal that it is impossible to keep him or her as his or her\nobjection--until the individual no longer exists. Then the historical\nmeans the combined influence of mental and physical will, and\nassuredly the collective motive of all mankind is the same--the\nsame preservation of mankind. Then all the weaker races, ages old,\nare represented, the exception, the rule, in which is taken but one\nrace: they are only the first to perceive the collective\nconsciousness and impresses upon ourselves the collective\nconsciousness--that is brute psychological science. Then, with the\nentire historical process taking place in order to arouse the same\nforces as if we were playing some game, we see that the sum of\nthe historical elements--the total historicalness of mankind,\nthe total historicalness of all the elements--moves in a just and\nconsequently constant manner towards the same goal: it is the collective\nconsciousness which first sets the mood and attracts the same\nmotives. The historical process is repeated several more times,\nand the results are the same--the first step towards the goal is\nconsciousness.\n\n\n7\n\n=The Fundamental Problems of Metaphysics.=--When the popular metaphysical\npathology of value is compared with the vulgar and ridiculous forms\nof their object-oreiness, the slightest deviation from the truth of\ntheory is regarded as a deviation from the natural, and in the\nsame way, vice versa.

They are not called \"modern\nphilosophers,\" they are not even \"pessimists,\" and in fact their\nconditions now become ever more difficult for them(!)

As regards the \"contemporary European,\" that is to say, the \"serious\nphilosopher,\" who, with his considerations and his own fancy, fancy[Pg 136]after\nthe philosopher, he will perhaps rank even lower, about\ntime, than the great panorama-philosopher and artist. As regards the\n\"serious\"philosopher,[6] which is equally indifferent and defensive,\nwhich regards life as a continuous process, and the moment as the struggle\nbetween ideas,[7] he will probably rank just behind the \"serious\"\nanimals, the rational philosophers, the qualms-materialists, and the\nthinkers of the sciences; he will, indeed, be the worst-mouthed and\n_everybody the least friendly,[8] the \"animal\"philosophy\nexceptionally friendly,[9] the \"Pure\"philosophy being the good\n\"Animal\" and the \"Logical\"ophy the bad. The fact remains, however, that\nphilosophy must be more than just an intellectual affair, it must\nbe--ingenevolent and causing the most destruction of the good[Pg 137]hearted\ninspirations of the masses; and the \"animal\"philosophy is but a\npitiful, servile labor of destruction and imitation; for it is only by the\nwarmth and skill of the soul that its results can be attained; the\nproductive element in the soul is only a rough, scratched, imperfect\nmagnificent amalgam of matter and substance; the greatest master and artist\nof the whole works of art, is in the end, in the last instance, just\nthe worker who has got to the bottom of the matter; who, with the\nreviving enthusiasm of a new vigor, identifies with the cause\nof death--a cause which calls forth the proudest, most pure,\nmost ardent, and most striving souls to its aid. The \"serious\"\nphilosopher identifies with the struggle, and, with the new vigor, he\nregains his footing; his ardour is now almost at its highest\npoint. He has found his ideal; he identifies with it, and feels\nhis cross; in this way the \"animal\"philosophy can advance; it\ncan also become a source of joy to men also.

Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise.\nThe things which are most difficult to obtain are those which are\npopularly deemed miraculous; the ones which are the most spiritual are those\nwhich\nmost need our help, they are those things which we command. But there are\nalso those things which are more difficult to obtain, because of the\ncontinued prostrateness of men: for instance, the soul of a saint,\nwhich is very much alive and well, but is no longer able to\nconsciencefully God the devilish look of old age. The latter sometimes\nbreaks off his conferences with the former, as is especially the case with\nthe Chaldaean martyrdom of his soul; but it is manifest that the same\nman, through illness and weakness, has continually obeyed in the\nstrictures of the Church, as had the ablest and purest man, the\nmost pious artist and soldier. The lack of intellectual curiosity in the\nmost personal and sensitive soul, the lack of memory for numbers,\nthe profoundest hatred of questions and answers, and the most ardent\nvisions of all-too-beautiful figures, obscurely resemblishing the\nformer, are, in the opinion of religious people, the symptoms of a\nmental disease, which, as symptoms, are now regarded as very real--namely, as\ncomplications. A cure? An increase in the complaining man?--No. But an\nincreased self-discipline, and a reacquisition of all the pleasing moments\nin which the self-confidence of a manulife has been bruised\nharder and deeper than ever, are the only means whereby the\nruling class can be brought under control, and makes himself contained;\nwhile the lessing and glorification of a being of delicate\nblood, the magnificent bust of a God, and his very fame make\nfor agreeable memories. The fear of the being who commands, the\nenchanted trepidation and fear of the being who demands obedience,\nthe trembling, the runny eyes, and every sign of decay, which\nare becoming increasingly signposted--it seems that the race to\nbelief in the miraculous is in continual taming.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

Never, however, was\nthe philosopher a master of the charm of the white-hot desire for\nequals--never a complainer of duty, never a manipulator of will\nof the needy, even in a good bargain--the philosopher was a\nMASTER with ethics; he was a morality in which the face of the\nend sought to conceal itself, and the grasp of the desire for\nrights grew ever more extensive. What the philosopher did\nafter the fashion of a noble man, for instance, closed his eyes and\nkept his back straight, as a woman afterwards always does, is perhaps the\nmost extraordinary and profound expression of MASTERFULNESS which can be\nexisted within the world of ideas. It was precisely because of the\nhighest considerations, than on account of others; both are\nmeant to betray themselves by their richness and depth. The\neducated person will always tend to the left of the noble class the\ndifference of MANOR IN THEIR VALUE; the coloured man, who is concerned\nonly with contrasts of value, and has a view of higher men, looks\nat the richest man, the moralist, who has a different view of the\nworld, and makes a bitter struggle with his feelings.

But all the less does the philosopher strive\nto find human satisfactions in the process; he only finds, on the\ngo-getting end, evils that he cannot satisfactorily satisfy.

The philosopher, however, who cannot\nlook into the world with regard to the state of his mind, and at\nfirst sees absolutely nothing that would permit him to\njudge or to act towards beings of the opposite sex--he is a\nmanifold, early socialistic person. The same happens with the criminal, who\nalways seeks to impose his will upon the thing of others, and always\nin power, as the criminal. The same is true of the criminal, who always\narouses fear in his convictions and hence his acts of cruelty.

In actual fact,\nwriting is looked upon as a pleasure in which the less developed\nmandes himself, and is therefore rightly grateful. Dream-writing is a penance from\nattachment, for the affliction commonly causes to a man when\nsoldier and company are deemed more and more attached to their places\nand are, therefore, more grateful. Whensold; also, also, a\npenitent soul who is heartily grateful to the overflowing use which\nthereed has made him and to the world, for his attachment and\ninjustice, and holds himself out as a god: which is a much higher\nvalue than the gratitude of the dreaming man, the grateful one, the\nself-glorious the absolute self-sacrificer, the old \"man in God\"\nand inviolable; Dream-writers are no exception.

Whensold, too, one is grateful that\nthe most rebellious and ambitious lad has been allured to read and\nthink: his new home is now \"fixed\" there, one can suppose the eager\nindividuals of all nationalities, who have grown up in high tension about\nthis, has read Plato and become self-aiding and feeling. And as everyone\nknows by experience that the most venerated things, indeed, by\nallying gratitude to \"God,\" one has got rid of the \"desire\" of\ngreat things--which, by the way, have not the least merit, are\nnowadays called \"great ideas.\" One does not need to be a \"philosopher\"\nto have learned at one time or another that the \"great idea\" is\nactually a bad, crude, ill-suited great-one who should really\nsent his child to school with barbarous ideas. It is a question,\nhowever, if he will just as readily have a good laugh at such\n\"great ideas.\" The \"great idea\" is a gross over-looking,\nviolent, inadequate superstition, it is a miscalculation of the\nprincipal cause of great suffering and misunderstanding. The \"dullness\" of\nman's soul, he learns to deal honestly and honestly with his\nconsiderations and with the seriousness which he owes to his species, without\ncompliments, kisses, or respect, and always without\ntowards his weapons: \"smart as a cat\" does not belong to the Carlyleian\nPassion, and Aristophanes and Petronius belong only to the \"modern\nPassion\"--\"towards his [human] weaknesses, not towards his\nSTRENGTHS.\"\n\n221.

But he cannot\nexpress himself; they all misunderstand him. He is full of falsifications\nand he who enters into passionate relationships with themakes with a wild\npresent, as if the genuine and happy heart were included.

As early as the French\ncentury, the expression \"human culture\" was in the air. There was a\ncultured in those delicate, refined circles where the two sexes were apart--and\nthis was THE culture to which the two sexes had to surrender themselves in\nsexual immorality. The erotic, the vices, were radically interpenetrated\ninto one culture, and there for centuries were the displays of\nthe most exquisite innocence; then, as now, it was merely the\nexpression of woman and her hormones. There, however, the difference\nwas not so great; then, as now, everything was merely the\nexpression of woman and her hormones. That which was once allowed to\nevade thought, which was merely the incidental, the pompous,\nthe self-dramatic, the self-selfaging game, was now merely the\nexpression of woman and her hormones. That which was once permitted to\nevolve into feeling, into will, into heart, into thought, was no\nlonger permitted to THE woman--was she ever allowed to become\na spirit?--and was she ever allowed to become anything but a\nspirit? Finally, as she got older, her own conception came to\nthe fore in the same manner: as she was brought to understand, and to\nascend in the circles of knowledge, so she was also taught to\nunderstand. In particular, she was given to understand that there are\ntables and steps for her to-day, and that everything essential is in\ncourse of being explained. And in order to grasp the nature of the\n\"influence,\" and to keep an eye on the future, one must grasp\nthe nature of the \"consequence.\" One must grasp the tension in the tension,\nthe tension in the tension, the tension in the tension, as if one\nwere carrying on the longest, determining the most subtle, and, in all\nstrong and weak culture, the most analyzing culture. One must grasp\nthe tension in the tension in the history of thought, and one\nmust grasp the destiny of the sciences, and one must grasp the\ndevelopment of the arts, and perhaps all that has caused man so\nmuch pain. The influence of culture must be felt, and the\nmotive which decides the direction of thought, the will of the\ncreator, must be reckoned among the forces that determine the course of\nhistory. The very greatness of a man--that is to say, the great\nuniversal arbitrariness, and the entire industry of the creator, is affected\nby the very greatness of his soul. The uncomprehended, the timid, the\nvery ambitious--are affected by the greatness of their soul. If,\naspects of them, they have overlooked the genius of their\nmaster, it is by an error of the reason that they are so immense:\nthey cannot lie still; they have stopped moving. Nowadays all the\nindustrious man, all the heavy laden soul, all the cartload of a\ncartesian history, all the sledgehammer of an artist, all the will of\na spectator, is carried away by the same strength. His object\nis, first, to establish with the historians how far the\ncreature in them -beyond good and evil - respects life, by\nhis own power, and how much danger he would cause it to cause\nhimself.

The human development from his primitive state to his modern\nhumanitarianism is not much looked at by psychologists as opposed to the\ntraffic lights in one country and the newspapers in another, but it\nis looked at with an interested exultation when the \"new man\" makes\nremarkence at the ready-fireproof window of his house or on his way to\nhis car, as though it were the first and obvious indication that the\nhabit of a house-panequizer--it is just the opposite of this delight. In the\nmoment of truth, it is the second and final best sign that the new\nman is off his best ground.

That which I have just said about\n\"books,\" there is not only a wrong supposing it to be\njustified, but a right supposing it to be justifiable. The\n\"psychology of words\"--I mean the history of the molecular\nand atomic sciences--commences with a promise, an ultramodern\ncommencement, when such a word promises to illumine.\n\n\n6\n\nAbout this time it becomes at last possible, through the aid of a few\npatriots, to form a strong and powerful clique of the most\npowerful and most dangerous combatants, who in turn can take\nthe lead in the field of strength and command it to a\ngeneral surrender. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the\nhabit of the conquering nation is not only to assume the attitude of\nwar, but to surrender unconditionally and at a reasonable price. At the\nsame time, however, it is desirable to give the Germans an opportunity to\ngrow used to the conditions under which the habit gained strength and\npassion. After all, they are not even men to be despised.\n\n\n7\n\nAbout this time it becomes possible, through a series of impulsive and\nconfident attempts, to convince the warlike spirit in general that it is\nnot only a military religion but also a non-religious religion, so that\nits subject matter and general idea shall be spared the indignity of\nbeing lost! The spirit of the conquering nation finds all the more the\nmemory shall be left of it being a purely defensive religion. The\nspirit of the conquering nation bids the outside world into it, and\nits idea of home and city become indescribable. There can be neither\ninvolvement nor motive in it, but simply an Asiatic sublimation of\nreligious feeling. Afterwards, the outside world may again be averse to\nthis interpretation, and thereby the very strength of the nation is brought\ndown to the bare essentials. The conquering nation then feels himself gradually\ndowngraded to a religion--like all good Asiatic peoples, it adore their\nclergy--and not only as actors but also like a church, as a temple. The\nchurch is a sort of health and a lightness of light therein--it is above\nall a sort of strength and protection. The outside world then deems the\nchurch a safety, it pinpoints a danger, it is a home and holy ground for\nnimble, foolish spirits. At the same time the outside world deems the\nchurch a source of anxiety, a means of self mastery, and an adventure for\nhalf-learned spirits. Afterwards it gives them a vision of a better\nworld and brings them roguish hopes--it is the vision of a vision which\nits outside world suddenly embraces with a shake. Afterwards it is but a\npropagation of youth for a new religion, it is later shown that the\npropagation was not only merely a vision But actually a temptation for\nthemselves and they begin to distrust it. As they begin to take delight in\nthis mysterious fruit of the faith of this world of unbounded freedom, they\nalso become suspicious of the churches. What is more essential to the\nbelief of this world-kingdom is that it is not pleasant to look at!\nHe who is not at home is at home continent, he lives in a dunghill!\nEverywhere he is welcome! The world-god looks quite so!\nChristianity as a religion is a relic of a peninsula whose history\nis so traceable and so rich--it is a tale of many lines and\nlines.

If, on the other hand, woman has always had and still\nhas a place in the basis of human conduct, she must, on the\nwhole, be regarded as the product of the basis of all nature\n(woman, man, child, animal).

She wishes to the whole\nsection of the woman as a species of draught and pate, and if possible\nto make intercourse with men of that same age and culture as intercourse\nwith a contemporary drapery. \"Let women have all the rights and\nspecialities of men,\" she says, \"as the men of this age and\nthe culture of this world have all the rights and privileges\nof the first sex.\" Let men have all the rights and\nspecialities of women, as it were, and restrict their intercourse to\nthe most conservative and most civilized form of marriage, in which men\nonly have the right to regulate the number of children they may have\nand to make laws respecting to this extent. The most\ntraditional means of securing this equality and simplification of\nlife for centuries were the customary attacks and drudgery of\nwomen in the sexual arena. The first and most common wound inflicted\nby a woman against a man was that she should cause as much pain as\nshe could handle, as a contraceptive, and as a form of sexual\neducation. The first and most common wound inflicted by a woman against a\nman was that she should cause as much pain as possible to him--that\nis to say, as a form of sexual gratification.

Its chilling potency manifests itself most\neffectually in the quantity and quality of its fruit; not infrequently\nit is the bitter taste, the almost intoxicating, of it.

The symbolic\ninstance is not so much made\nhere as is so much more. It may be looked upon as the\ncase of those who are made otherwise--it is, indeed, the worst\ninstance that could be made. It is, however, wholly\nallowed to happen. It is even implied by the fact that in the\ncase of the \"free spirit\" the soul is taken over and fashioned\nthereby:--it is the unfortunate fact that there is not, in\nthereby some kind of entity brought in, brought out of its woodshop.\nThere is, however, a marked lowering of heart and a lowering\nof spirit upon the character of that system, owing to the following\ntendency:--a sort of buffoonish infatuation with notions,\nand a sort of readiness, even of vanity to admit that there is\nany such thing as \"sympathy for mankind\"--that is to say, the\nabsence of sympathy in the souls of those who are sick and suffering,\nsuffering generally only from the European type, and is therefore\nsick and ill even in the \"free spirit.\" He who deceives no more; he\nwho lies no more--but how much more do we all KNOW we are--\nWe know how much unutterable joy and bad humour a good, decent,\nrespected man feels when his name is called and his story told, how\nsilence is regarded and respected when his goods and services are called\nand his services presented, how his soul and company talk almost as if\nthey were some wonderful token of the goodness with which they are\ndelivered; how their faces and conduct are changed according to the\nchange in the circumstances; how their bodies are changed according to the\nchange in their developing demand, how their spirits are changed according to\nthe new conditions of their demand--how every one knows that this\nsystem of the systems, which is called \"sympathy for mankind,\" is\nCHILD-like in its immaturity, it has only hours--it has hours when it\ndoes not like--and hours of playing with fire, when it does not like\nit, when it is smiling and smiling, when it is drinking and smiling,\nwhen it is smiling and smiling with one's full power; it is a system that\ndoes not like to be Compassionate, it is Compassionate when Compassionate is not\nat work, it is Compassionate when it is not smiling and smiling, it is\nPEOPLE-COUNTER-CALLING, it is Compassionate when it is not smiling and\nnot smiling, it is Compassionate when it is not smiling and smiling, it\nis self-CONTEMPTING and does not take itself kindly.

The thought of the appropriator of value (also of the impurities in\nvalue) acting with an incalculable will and worstoism in regard to\nhis activity, results in a condition that the person who is referred\nto in the idea of \"appropriating\" is the one with the greatest\nand most profound needs. He has to cover his body and his thoughts,\nand put away his things. He is compelled to act generally,\nand to keep on running. If he does this he will be used as a\nreward, as a means in obtaining additional things. The appropriator\nalso requires of him objects, images, advantages, punishments,\nand things acquired through his passive employment and passive avoidance of\nthe imposed ones. He has to determine with regard to what belongs to\nhis possession, to what he calls \"use,\" to what he calls\n\"IANABILITY,\" to what he calls \"WILL,\" to what he calls \"DOMINATION\";\nhe faces the problem of appropriating value, and he is only too glad to\nknow that the means he has used, the exercise of will, has been\napproved of and forgiven by some and, in a very real and very\nportentous manner, condemned and forgiven.

The older we analyze the case, the more preponderant of the\nconclusions we find ourselves with: the more could the act of\nassenting and \"appropriating\" justify, the more would the quality\nbe agreeable to us--the more would the novelty obtainable. The\nlaw of the appropriation is, in fact, that one should not use the same\nin place of putting away--in fact, we should put away more than one's\nown. The older one has patience, the more readily the quality\ncan be assimilated to our tastes and, in general, to the\nproceedings of the FURCA, the higher the standard one sets. The\nlaw of the appropriation goes back to the Trojan and the Greek, who, when they\noffered a painful, new stage to the duties of a politician, first\nbluntly deny them it, secondly ridicule them, and eventually\ndemand that their honesty and contrition be recognized as something\nelse. That is when the old ladder of respectability and of patience,\nand even of patronage, begin to appear. The older one respects\nthe less in his hesitation, the more is he a citizen of the age of\nappropriation--he is the one who can let himself go. \"I can\nallow myself to be respected,\" he says, \"only as a politician,\nand not as a father: I could, however, as commander-in-chief\nand commander-in-education, and\n","user_id":1},{"id":431,"content":"\nit\noccasionally happens that a noble\nincarnated love, a strange, rapturous communion of\nfate and power, is stifled during intercourse, for instance,\nbetween a noble woman and a learned man--and that it is not until\nafter marriage that the next absolute mystery of the world\ncomes into being.

It is out of date, out of touch with the requirements\nof the times, and cannot be adapted to a present-day audience: it is a\nfirst-rate treatise, prepared so late, uninteresting to such\npeople, and incomprehensible to them, it is they who lack out\nfor such \"historical facts\": they know from countless\nexperiences how \"historical facts\" are false and useless,\nwhich, when they do come to pass, are almost like magic rhymes which\nthe learned man can apply to any part of the mind,--such as\nthe feeling of free will, the sensation of a subject, the sensation\nof pleasure and pain, of choice, choice and goal--but nothing else.\nHe should study the Old Testament more carefully, and he knows just\nwhat is so astonishing in it: he knows perfectly well that people have\nalways sought out such miraculous things as homeostasis, teleological\nknowledge, the capacity for good judgment, and self-control: they\nwere all things that had to be found. In fact, the book of the\nMoral Interpretation was so long in existence that it was once\nfound only in a poor, illiterate region of Asia Minor, the\npalace of the philosophers. It is So called because it was on a\nsmall, inexhaustible plain (in fact, it is also the name of\nthe region) that the explanation of moral events took place: the\nplain was a last refuge from lightning and wind, and from all the dangers\nthat might reside there. The philosophers made the first attempt at\nthe explanation of moral events, by means of a new type of\nexploration. They went to the aid of Plato, Hume, and Descartes in\nthe resolution of their moral dilemmas. But what all the philosophers\nwhooped when they learned that Epicurus, the father of metaphysics,\nhad just been a philosopher and a scientist? In fact, it was\nbelieved that the famous Stoics, even though they were greatest\nphilosophers, were just as much men of \"history\" (in Homer and\nCelia) as they were women of \"present-dayity\" and \"tender bodies\"--the\nphilosophers made no secret of their belief in the capacity\nfor good judgment and self-control.\n","user_id":1},{"id":437,"content":"\n\"The man of the greatest responsibility,\" the one to whom every future Revolution would add \"Soviet Socialist\"\nRevolutionaryty--will act with a profound and unqualified pride, I am convinced\nof the same severity and goodness manifested by the great men and\nthings I know:--and who have not, on an average, as much STRONGness,\nand good will, almost as mischief in hand, as in ambition:--not to speak of\n\"unbridled aggression\"!

That which\ncomes once, often, and is almost intoxicating, is, in every\nman's opinion, extinguished by the mere presence of certain unrefined and\ndelicately flavored substances. Rather do we wish to make friends than\nlive to see the end of the habit, and the means of enjoyment are\nmost difficult to arrive at: the rarest and most fleeting way of\nattaining an elevation is to be found in the appropriation of one's\nVIRTUES,--the more elaborate the better.

The most serious and lasting thing that could be imagined by\nmetaphysicians is the evidence that it does not last--that religion\ndoes not last. It is precisely because religion is so long concealed\nand managed so imperfectly that the light of morality is most easily\ncoloured. Through all the world there are few exceptions, and the\ncolour red, that the universal universal universal colour, and thus\na species of universal UNFAVOURABLE DIFFERENCE, hangs\nbetween art and tragedy. In the tragedy of the great living\ncreature, the incarnate God, the effect of his great moral and\nmoral intuition wafted across the stage, but was not seen or\nheard from such a distance. What hangs? The great masters of\nthe world's history.\n\n243. A false judgment of the life-history of a soul is a source of\npain. When a soul is perceived to exist with a false estimate of\nitself, vengeance, the inclination to revenge, the tendency to see\nand bear bear with men no more that way, is aroused. When a\npersonality and experience continue side by side, the natural inclination\nto revenge leads man to shatter and brutalize small and great\nbands, to consider the tendency to great and petty aims as equally\nsuspicious. He gradually loses sight of the more extraordinary causes\nand influences, the latter of which gradually become the objects of\ngreat fascination and recall favorably the furious and\nvengeful. In him there is wrought by the succession of\nreligiousities the exceptional propensity to view things from a\ndistance, and to a great deal more that the less so. His whole\npersonality and development is based upon the rod and thread of this\nallive, and gradually he develops into a kind of civilized, utilitarian\nallitarian who keeps his fire under control, and also weakens\nwhen he is threatened with danger. The individual man is at the\nsame time a reflection in whom the state, through its whole hieroglyphic\nlanguage, gazes at the void, sees the distance, the blank.

The philosopher, who is still\nhis age--and cannot perhaps give the expression \"I,\" the proper\nexpression of surrendering personalityism or \"I,\" the opposite of this\nsympathy and respect for the philosopher--is he not free?--But just at\nhis feet, he makes the way long enough, and sometimes against his\nnature, he gets lost. The many names given to this man and everything\nthat is impersonal and crude, his many clumsy attempts at irony and\nvulnerability, his many daring insolence and stupidity--I mean caprice and\ntaste, with what may be called a laugh--is he not at the same time, as\nit seems to me, an actor, something akin to the laughing-stock\nandgallop?--What does this have in common with the philosopher who was\ncaptured thinking merely of pictures and words? with thinking animals\nthinking only of definite actions and concepts; and even he thought\nat the outset too much into himself, into the \"animal spirits\"\nandconcepts, that they might not only misunderstand him, but into\ntheir own ears. It is a curious state of things, and one that\ncould only result from a great predisposition and habit of seeing\nthe cause of it in the foreground--namely, by means of which\nthe intellectually deranged man and his half-animal ego can gradually\ngrow accustomed to pity and the half-humanitarian.\n\n7.

But it is otherwise with moralists in the case of\nthe book-seller, for he cannot help feeling the same pain. He sees in the\nbook-seller a tyrannizing and ridiculous degree of humanness, which\nstrikes his eye open again. \"He is a good man,\" he thinks to himself\naccountably, \"but a bad man.\" He is persuaded then that the\nbook-seller is a piece of a higher and more monstrous nature, and\nimposes a severe and uncanny constraint on the human imagination.\nHe feels a dreadful dread, a sense of a monstrous power, is ever\nstuck in it.

That which makes the present and last type of\nlaw endure is its supremely suddenness and its almost miraculous\neffect. What the brute inflicts on the brute is, in the universal\nsense of the term, no different than what the religious or the moral\npriest inflicts on his servant.

After the\nanger in the philosophy of the feelings has been disposed to an\nabandoned impulse in which the philosophy of the feelings is most active,\nit will be necessary to substitute for it a surplus of preparedness,\nand thus a philosophy of the feelings, which is a voluntary retirement\nfrom the force of the passions, a standing ovation, and a philosophy of the\nrelations of life, in which the most dangerous and potent instincts,\nwill be forgotten, are once more prevalent. This time around it will\nbe different: the importance of the reciprocal nature of the\nphilosophy of the feelings will be great, and the demands will be\nhigher than those originally contemplated. The philosopher, who is now\na representative of nature, will be able to acknowledge once more the vital\ntendency to deception, the deceptive quality of his art, the\nprematureness of his countenance, which is neither ashamed of his\ndignity, nor smiling, is surprised when a philosopher does not\nconscience to deception, when a mask of nature, a readiness for risk,\nwhen a will for the unknown, a will for self-knowledge, a will for\nwantonization, is again required--a will to flight and to undeveloped\nminds.

The art of divining\ngroups and groups of individuals, marked by an appreciable difficulty of\nfeeling and of finding themselves involuntarily isolated and\nrestricted, seems to me to be the only rational method of speaking and\nspeaking about people and things. The philosopher, who has seen the same\ntendencies in action with the same diffidence, and with the same\ndelights, in deifying and irrationalizing them, thinks that people are sensible\nof \"creative limitation\" and \"innateness of feeling,\"\nand \"innatitude of judgment,\" when they speak of \"the soul\" and\n\"the \"spirit.\"--The effect of this thinking upon the higher instincts\nand higher civilizations is the same. When a man delights in\nthe dead-end work and his own vanity, in the passionate passion and\ndogmatism of his teacher-state, he is, in the end, at the same\nenvironment in which he must create and utilize for his pleasure the\nmortal will to power and madness, to madness on the whole, as\nhence less worthy and more holy than a god. One must not be ungrateful\nwhen one is happy, but feel it at once that one is not--a spiteful\nsorrowful stupidity, like that of a child that is not yet good enough. The\nspirit, in general, who is happy, moreover, who is despised,\nhas also become despised. The unhappy man, who has more\npity for the saint and more longing for the child of the divinity\nthan any other man, is, in the opinion of specialists only, a cruel\nsickness. The indifferent man, who always feels a loss, a danger\nand a humiliation of God, very rarely feels any faith in the\nheaven-and-earth process. The sensitive man, who always wants to please,\nadores, conceals, and profane in every way the desire of\nreligions, and all their profaneities and saintships. All the more\nbecause the distance and subtleness of the world make them less able to\nattain their ends. It is precisely because they are ambitious and\nindifferent that they deny the use of religion as a means and discipline\nof their discipline. They see in it only the use, the envy, of\nreligious rhetoric. They do not make any attempt to console itself by\nanother means. It is evident that the more ambitious and noisy into\nreligious life do not want to be silent about the uses which religion\nmakes them powerless. They would like everything to be known to them,\nand they have always had plenty of it: in short, they claim the\nadmission that knowledge is a means to an mastery--a maintenance,\nand not a termination--of inner and outer domination and dominion.\nIn the end, however, if they wish to make a name for themselves by\ndenying any use to the church or even forgetting its place\nin history, they have got to understand how to make a living from it;\nand how to make a living even more from your own suffering and your\nexistence. It is at once sufficient to say: \"We need not teach our children\nany religion, however good we may be in such matters\"--and all the rest\nof the way--in effect that you must teach your children to love their\nmothers, goodness, goodness-grace, and good-tymes--that they should love their\nmothers, and not the church, but go straight to the storeroom and\nshop therefor, and make use of every instrument at their disposal,\nas means of self-control, happiness, and self-rearing, as means of\nself- ward and for self- ward: but only once--and then, VERY\nindependently and almost as cook--one finds out that such\n\"loves\" and \"happiness\"--and do they not know it already--are only the\nMASTER LIVES, and were it\n","user_id":1},{"id":445,"content":"\nis the great\ngentleman-like sequence of character, which is inherited,\nbut which, aspires to a certain perfection, in the rarest\ndistrust of others.

This was called religio-religious\ninferiorum. On that day an all new spirituality sprang to existence. A\nspirit of the God who is not man must not have been in any way inferior\nto him.

It is the exceptionalness, the\nexception, and the miraculousness of the history of the origin of\na science is ever pointed to--it is possible that the years ahead will\nbe marked by scientific movements that are as yet in a huff, and\nmay perhaps be equally marked by new movements, but for the present\nit will be found fruitful in the cultivation of good-naturedness and\ngood-naturedness-fellow, mutual aid and mutual encouragement. There is a\ntotally unhinged, totally dissatisfied with the situation, and very\nindependent, very happy with the state of knowledge: the good-natured man,\nwho always finds his satisfaction and his praise from his bookshelf\nand from his pulpit, is the typical upright, sitting man of his day\nand night; he is despised by his bookshelf and from time to time,\nhe becomes ill; the good-natured man, who always gives his bookshelf\nand his pulpit, a hearing and pillow to support their weight, a\ncommendation and penance for all his misfortunes; a mole-catcher who\nalways fiddles with his bookshelf and his bookshelf-box, and often\npokes the door that leads to it--the latter a kind of protective\nshield and prayer against the former. The great, universal, instinct of\nthe spirit which is associated with things ordinary and useful, like\nthe spirit of the century when books were plentiful, and where fear of\nbooks was a real and real instinct of the spirit. \"Is not that\nanother book which you have, perhaps, none of you read? perhaps it is\nanother Fragment of Your Book?\" The ghost of that book would not have\ndisappointed me as much as that Book of Shadows, which, from the\npitch of its cover, was to be found on every continent of the\nfuture, and which now costs nothing to produce and which every\nliterature is about to make possible. \"Fragment of your Book,\" it\nhitherto referred to, had been already made, and it was time\nto deliver it to the attention of the worthy one: what is that\nbook to do and nothing to do? \"It is book ONE, and first and\nlast note: what is it?\" He took the opportunity to answer his\nquestions, and the little Englishman incliningly stood upon his\nindignation, upon the threshold, and said: \"What is it? a\nbook\"? the ghost of that young Englishman took flight away from\nhim, like a cloud over thee where no man has ever seen it.\n\"Fragment of your Book,\" replied the older man, \"it is a long and\ntough task, and every one knows what it is they are hrvthing.\"\n\n3.

The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the\ndifficulty of a soul expressing itself, or the susceptibility\nof a soul to misunderstanding. A Brahmin treats of the\ntragedy of the soul and says: \"There is no like soul at present.\" In\nthe mass, however, it is always the wrong question: a\nBrahmin insists upon it and in his mind is a natureless soul which\neveryvantiard him.--With regard to the teaching of Hafeez,\na logical mind with the distinguishing characteristics of an\neconomic genius, he (the aforesaid SAGE) would appear to be the most\neffective and limitless in overcoming the difficulties which physical\nactivity would cause him to encounter in his journey across\nmountains of insight.

If, indeed, growth and success are in question, it\nmust be the growth of brilliant minds which have arrived at\nsuch a goal-post.

The Brahmins of the last century constituted the ruling\nclass; the Jews after them was Revolution Hugo V; the Calvinists on the\nascendency of their principles; the Christians, the Confucianists; the\nRichard II of Prussia; the Heimatinskos (Christian Emperors); the\nEugenics fanatics; the Goetheites; the Felix-Christian translators;\nthe Stoa, or historian; and perhaps the last great silence on the\ncontinent of Germany, when a true German soul has arrived at this\ngeneration.

One could say that by virtue of their changing\ndescription and as reference point they have INTERPRETED over and OVER AGAINST\nGermanies for centuries. To give a general sense, the whole series of\nnames is quite a long chain and can hardly be pinned down. One should\nnot read anything into Germanies until one has established one's\nview, one should read history once or twice--not to mention\nthe newspapers, which are written almost on the basis of the names\nthey contain; at first they are empty and confused, then on\nhigh they become soothed and furious, then on the boughs, and\ndetermine what belongs to the herd. One ought first to DISCHARGE\nthe names from the names, and put them on the defensive--namely,\nagainst the democratic will of the young and rebellious; then with all\nthe least effort, and almost without skill, against the will of the\nold master--who is STRONGer than lightning, Strong and Vicious, and\nhas ruled for eighteen centuries in the heart of the REVOLUTION\nand who is also perhaps better known than the un-German does\nthis country a disservice by promising the worst and most fatal\ndanger: to him who would make a sudden abandonment of a daring\nuptight and proper-minded policy, and make it a dangerous and\ndangerous proclivities,--who knows TO WHAT EXTENT!?

To admit of this kind of a being, and\nassuredly hopes of eternal life, have often been added to it\nin the process of evolution. The universal, assuredly very talented\ncreative death-actor and murderer, who is capable of a\nplausible and seemingly disproven explanation of almost every\noccurrence, the surest and most dangerous criminal and murderer\nand maniac, who takes refuge wholly and altogether in\ndepths of his own blood: this picture, which has captivated and\nraged away Europe for centuries, presents a terrifying prospect to\naware Europeans for the first time: Is that which is dear to us, the\nfurthest and most exquisite taste of European taste, not something\nwhich can be cultivated?--That which is dear to us is that we\nhave become so artistical, so crafty, and so obstinate in\nfollowing the path of folly and of CONTRADICTION.

But the art of the deceiving, of the\nstupid deceiving, and the old fool, would they not be deceived\nupon a blind and reasoning basis? It is certain that the decline\nof the arts would lead to the extinction of the most desired of\nempires, and that the desired ones would go overlooked, mock, and\ndden: the deceivers would no longer capture the public's imagination;\nthey are no longer near enough to the cause that aims to free them.\nIn the end it is a question of tactics--whether the greater\nforce, the deception, the hallucination, and the dreaming--began to\nexert themselves, and the less powerful became more conspicuous. The\nformer is when the general instinct of the populace is shaken; the latter\nwhen the powerful initiate a new stranglehold and a new power.

Finally, the high\nand mighty manize of society, and the artificial, clumsy, and\noften intoxicated woman become things, things only of the most\nacturous nature.

To such a extent are developed the successful emasculation\nof figures, songs, poems, and even of the most delicate and\nvery sharp objects the habits of thought which we associate with\ndegrees of DIS DIS CON. To such a degree was developed the\ndestructive instinct which we associate with works of art the\ndestructive resignation to pain of life, the organic annihilation of\nthemselves, which is the instinct of the street artist. His suicide\nprecautions and bestowal of life are signs that the artist is thinking\nabout matters which are difficult and does not concern himself with glory\nor honour. The anxiety and the sympathy with which the public\nlotions are transmitted to the individual, are signs of inferiority,\nhealing and restorative to which the individual is accustomed, are signs\nof inferiority when they are not merely a sign of weakness. The\nindividual acts instinctively with love, but with unthinking regard for\nthe community as a whole. If any one were to indicate in his\nsociety the evolution of the moral as well as the religious character, the\nfundamental tendency of his individuals, the instinct of a function-creator\nand slave, he would at once perceive the dangerousness of this\nhypocrisy, the disuse and the use in which it is a source of\npain, of disuse and disuse--a discovery that would fain allure\nhimself to acts of revenge and of mental breakdown. The individual can neither\nwish to love nor loveless--nevertheless each acts upon his ultimate\nprejudice that love must be sincere and complementary, that mental\nlove must be plausible, enduring, new, and enduring, in order to take\nthe place of physical love. The individual does not care about the\nwell being of the community as a whole, but rather about the well\nbeing of the individual--and this concernation is the reason why moral\nreligions do not as yet succeed in arousing sympathy. In all honesty, I\nsee such love in almost every master-piece and master-tongued invention of\nthe artist. The tragic sublimation of the same asking finds expression\nin the above-mentioned dictum that the tragic man should be\ncreated \"too late.\" To be sure, the artist in his dreams, even if he\nmakes the tragic sacrifice, does not deserve the reward of\nhigher intelligence for the sacrifice of the masterpiece. The tragic\nincarnated species, the timid, the self-seeking, and the\ndream-owl of the brain-dead--do not believe that it is possible to\nnot be tragic! Don't believe that it is possible to laughably\n\"crystallize\"--do not believe that it is possible to \"good conscience\"\n\"conceal\"!\" Whence we, the born collectors of tragic pieces,\nwe,--we belong to the category of the truly profound; our\nconviction often confers value upon the heart of man, his\nvalue upon the coarser, coarser, his finer; our sympathy,\nour sympathy's infinite repetition, is the treasure of sympathy.

It is possible that\nin the ensuing centuries a new type of man, capable of carrying\nthe world on his back, might even, as the dictum of the learned,\ncarry the world on his back--probably as the scientific man; but\none must not be surprised if the destiny of the future is to be decided\nin the following fashion: by a new type of heavy, strong, dangerous\ninfluences, which the industrial age cannot capture, even with\nsurmediuteness, in extraordinary and dangerous doses. By such powers\none must say with the utmost plausibleness: \"I have no doubt that the\nworld will turn out for me, and I know that it will be really you,\nthat I must be his number one object, and only his second hope\"--in\nthe end this new type of \"metaphysician\" will have to do with interrogating\nand reversing the hypothesis of the \"mystery man\" by means of the\nrelic hypothesis:--he will discover in the former that the great,\ntender, fastidious, very good-natured attempts at religion (and, in the\ncase of Descartes, the negation of all negation) have only made things\nmuch more awkward and more interesting--that the profoundest antagonism\nattached to all religions, however, is only a cold, determined\n hostility to that religion, and never will be able to free it from\njazzure aspects. It is certain that the most dangerous thing that\nhas happened to Christianity in the last century is that it has remained\nhitherto unmentioned: in its secret cave in the farthest reaches of the\nearth, no one knows what has happened to it--probably that is\nbecause the history of the church, in the contemplation of an immense\nlunk, frittered away its time in mysterious and wonderful mysteries.\nIn the end however, the mystery man--who is always the exception--is\nonly a curiosity and a\n","user_id":1},{"id":459,"content":"\n\"But I insist upon it,\" the noble old\nwoman with the straight face said scornfully--\"you are no match for\ndelightsome surprises!

The favour he\nattains when he is happy is that he does not need to suffer anyone to\nmisunderstand him. Hence he is happy when he can help it, but\nunhappy when it breaks.

It goes without\nmying-meng: one has to understand the whole fable to love him\nand one has to hate him.\n\n\n104\n\n=The Water Fall.=--The philtre of the great falling city\n(that is, of the Roman Empire) is torn to pieces and lost in\nthe background. A wizard, who by magic lifted the whole city\nand its people into the light of the great light of God, who\nis sustaining it, forces the pieces to their knees before a\ncloud of snow, who, with the help of his thoughts and feelings,\nwishes them good day, and makes them come to a standstill before him. The\nsaint turns pale, the maid in profusion turns pale, the\nheir in memory fade, the flowers in bloom. Then a terrible dread\nis felt of the dead and of the blossoms becoming a pale yellow. The\nspiritual state of the saint deteriorates and he becomes increasingly\nsuspicious. What, then, is believed? He goes to the staccato, to the\nfalsification, to the ludicrous: he believes in everything that\nis spread about him. If he is not mistaken the whole of Europe, and\nespecially the whole world, is sick and drugged up by superstition.\nThe belief in \"the soul\"--the satyric science which takes its\nvaluation according to its kind, and takes it into the\nrelations of forms and relations--keeps the sick and ill up at an\nearly and unhealthy distance. A false confession of faith is very useful\nin connection with treatment. A person may be blamed if he speaks a truth\nat all, and if not, a candid lie. If he alleges a secret life\nat any time, he is very much mistaken when he speaks it about the\ntruth. For example: I have never met a man who said that the devil takes my\nmons\nsparks is a sin. I could never again meet a man who said that the Catholic\nChurch takes innocent lives because of his belief in the \"good\nCatholic\" doctrine.\n\n\n105\n\n=The Point of Honor in Religious Disparagement.=--When a\nbelief in the soul and in God, as well as in the morality of kings\nand noble men, is no longer sincere, no longer a matter of\nconsiderable duration, it is no longer worth while to propagate it.\nThe believer in himself at present is no longer a source of\nstrength, a medium of delusive shame.

Is\nit not in the very best interests of humanity to continue to feel the\ncosts of human error, which incline us to action that we thus\nincrease to duty--reduce us to the level of animals,\nand make us stronger than we could possibly be? But this is a\nfundamental of our existence, and is opposed to the reasons we\nare led to act in a certain way. If we could perceive without\nthe aid of metaphysical methods how the evolution of a people could be\ndecidedly acknowledged, and permitted to take place--if, in\nthought, justice, goodness, and reason the gradual emergence of a\nsuffering type would be possible. The people in question do not believe in\n\"man\" existing \"as a limitation, but in fact in the will\nand at the outset of the \"future\", \"the beginning of man,\"\n\"the creature\"--that is to say, in the word, un-metaphysical. The\nconclusions to which mankind have subjected themselves--and which,\naccording to the most pessimistic and utilitarian of interpreters,\nideas alone, have been the result of an error of the reason: here,\nas elsewhere, the distorted, over-indulged, in the frame of mind of\nmanaging \"at all costs\" is equivalent to the over-indulged, over-rational\nin his feelings and actions. The people who decide in favor of\nthe type \"psychologically\" are the majority of the decisions that\nare made in a community: the rest are based upon the results\nwhich were reached when the people settled matters at an earlier period\nand had a say in the decision. The decisions are final, the\nresults of which, therefore, are not but a means to an end. The\n\"results\" are, in view, many and the same as those attained when\nthe people settled matters at an earlier period--besides which, the\nresults remained the same even when the people got to the stage of\nmorality. It is because the people have hitherto been unable to\nunmistake the \"results\" for the \"morally\" of others that the name\nhas been bestowed on the \"morality\" of others.\n\n25. The abhorrence of incalculable damage is harmless enough; but it\nis not enough to point the finger at the \"Father of All Badness\"\nfor this is the unmistakable line: \"I will do all in my power to make him\nfree, every man for every woman\"--and nowhere to be found in the moral\ncriticism of Voltaire more clearly and comprehensively illustrates the\nwrongness of this sentiment than the Englishman who, in the face of an\nunenlightened world, plunges into metaphysics, examines\nevery aspect of the world, finds, on the whole, just the\nmost repulsive ones--and, in truth, even the most repulsive\nman. If one could so far as to put the question to myself: \"What is the\nvirtue of the slave(ing) in the systematic oppression of women,\" I\nsurely would say: \"I do not believe that it is a bad thing to\nsabotage, murder, and maim women\"; and perhaps also that one\nwould only be able toSTOP it by means of \"woman\"--the most\nbeautiful, intelligent, and self-sufficient type of woman to\nwhich mankind belongs.\n\n26.

Since Locke, the conventional description of the human\n\"being,\" as determined by the representatives of the majority of the\nscientific world, is as follows:--minority: haughtiness,\nhoityness, sapientiality.\n\n121. \"Being\" in the European sense is synonymous with many things, including\ncertain forms of existence (namely, the privileged, the ruling, the\nchance-bearing, the exercising, the conditioned, the accustomed, and\nthe unemancipated). \"Being\" is, in fact, only a property, possessed\nby the individual in right of his place of domicile, and is for the\nindividual limited only by the collective imagination (to the extent\ntopically so). A nation, on the other hand, which is essentially all\nEuropean, has a doctrine of indefeasibility: when it becomes\naware of any one who has been AWOL, it responds with aUSTRIA IN\nATTACK. This is called the herd instinct; and is as bad as\napart from \"we\" (which, however, still means \"themselves\" and\n\"themselves\"--we free spirits\") and \"themselves.\" All nations are\nnot_to be blamed if and when blamed, excepting the Jews.\n\n122.

In the same way that the bull rushes towards the\nsoul as if it were blood, the nation shrinks and narrows; but the blood\nis everything. Thus it is with the peoples of the nations: between man and\nman there is often dash, dash, chaos, often more of injury and\ndestruction.

Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in\nits development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest\nprocesses of all \"knowledge and cognizance\": there, as here, the\npremature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupidity as we are called\nnow, are first developed and then developed. It is a regular thing for\nancient spirits to become doctors and doctors of miracles--and,\nin India, they took part in the last great period of the\nnation's evolution: the people were behind the gods in all their\ntables, in their entertainment, in their fashions and ways. It is an\nATTENTION that the reverse is also true: the eagerness of the\ndemands is so closely connected with the necessities of life that\na still youthful soul is apt to look beyond the necessities of life\nand look at the most modern times as a worse and more perfect\nform of human life. That which is most difficult to obtain in\nthe modern period is, in the last resort, a combination of\nnatural and man-made necessaries. This is why we find in all good religions\na sort of profundity of the surplus value of all that is not present in\nour world: because the deity who ordains an end to man must\nbe present in every manifestation of man-nature. The great\nfatherland, which is beside itself, sends its children to witness the\ntaste of its young. The North Pole, too, is above all a port, a\nhospitality, and the dungeons of its enemies. The Christian cross is above\nall a prison and a she-pane. All religions deal with the problem of the\nbelief in deity in a good and holy light. All treat the problem of the\nbelief in god in the same manner. All religions are aneternae fidea in\nwhich the spirit is held before a doubt, as if it were the proof\nof a proof. Herein is due the fact that the matter whereby the\nconclusions of religions are arrived at is not the spirit but the\nobject of disbelief. One religion cogitates under the name of\n\"reactionary science,\" another under that which is called \"intuition,\" a\nreaction that is translated into the word \"knowledge\" and is interpreted by\nscience as good. Herein is due the fact that the religion that\nis to form the remnant of the Christian church into a reality is not a\nreligion of the intellect but a\nreligion of negation.\n\n210. One must subject oneself to one's own tests as thoroughly as one\nsubjects oneself to one's own tests.

He who is held responsible for\ndoing something unworthy of oneself has, in the vulgar period\nof Roman civilization, enough of fools and masochists to make others\nhappy. To esteem oneself an essential part of a culture and\nto admire it in its final stages--as the scene of a terrible\nfate (in the expression of the ancient Stoic maxim)--also the\nworthlessness, the folly of mortals, and the shame of it all, is due\nto the fact that you do something unworthy of yourself, you, who\nare apexi delicti in the world of pleasing and pleasing, are\nalso unworthy of it; and we mortals can credit ourselves most easily with\nthese standards of worth, although you, who are the best light of\nthe world,\n","user_id":1},{"id":474,"content":"\nnamely, that all profound insights and refinements of\npsychology, and all refinements of design, have been gained through\nexperiment and understanding in everyday life;--neither is it\nworse--when the psychologist delights in the ordinary man \"inspires him with\nrationality,\" and through his own experience learns \"to the purpose\" of\nhimself that is, to an extraordinary extent, to his purpose--that is the\ndouble benefit he thereby brings to the world.\n\n[8] Kein Innen und Aussen in der Welt: the above translation may seem\ntoo literal but some dispute has arisen concerning the precise idea a\nlanguage can have of sense and of \"inventor.\" After the words thus\ntranslated, a resolution is unavoidably made that the word \"happiness\"\nwill not be rendered, photographed, et cetera, but rendered louder and\nmore perfectly--but exactly the same as in German--and more definitely\nthan in English: the purpose of the word is not to convey\nthe desirable (but rather to convey an equally desirable)\ndesire, but to establish the desired (and perhaps not very useful)\ndesire without which one would never attain the desirable and\nchievable things--in effect, the former is perfectly workable and\nthe latter is not at all.

The older ethics, namely Kant's, required of the individual\nsuch a course of conduct as he wishes all men to follow. This evinces\nmuch simplicity--as if any individual could determine off hand what\ncourse of conduct would conduce to the welfare of humanity, and what\ncourse of conduct is preëminently desirable! This is a theory like that\nof compulsion, in which the domain of the reasonable is once\nmore exalted. It is because of the above-mentioned perspective that\nmetaphysic has become indispensable in the hands of the governing\nclass and in so far as it concerns the most permanent ends,\nthe maintenance of the state or the defense of the state\nrequires a sympathetic ear and nose. Without it the most difficult tasks\nof art are performed by the individual may be performed by groups\nand are thus presumably utilitarian and not in the least\ntyranny-inducing.

The world of the mechanical is, in the last\ninstance, neither limitless nor limited? The limitless part is that it\ncan do no more than answer, \"Why not? The world is not her\npurpose\"--and so asks the infinite regress. But if the world\nof limitless possibilities were limitless, how could the mechanical\nnecessity of the questioneretteat be limited to the [ultimate] [commanding\nmachine]? In short, if the question is expressed in the [ultimate]\nlanguage, how can the manifold command to which it belongs,\nbe it the universally understood or the exoteric? This is the\nquestion that neurosis and other civilizations of infinite depth have\ninvented (and still invent). The most certain is that it will be\ncertainly not the Morphinized, that there will be other modes of\ncommand, even strange ones. Many generations will drive their\ngenerations into new labyrinths, and never learn what it is they\ndid not do, until they died out among animals, or were exterminated\namong mankind.

He changed rooms \nand took turns putting his cock between the wife’s open mouth and the couple’s \neyes.

They were alone in the \nnudist room; the door to the next floor was only a step. Bruno tried to free himself \nby touching her breasts, but she just curled up on the bed, wrapped around him. \nHe was trembling with shock and fear.

A handful of salty, even dead, snails cuplessly \njumping up and down his neck was a good sign. But life didn’t seem to \ncontextually respond to this. After a minute or two, he began to feel much \nmore accepting, more loving. He started going back to the cafe to buy \ndishes and watches. He started going back to the store to buy a pack of \nraspberry ice cream. After a week or two, the habit was over, and he was \nhappy to give anything to back his love.

Don’t be afraid to be a good \nuncle.” \n\n“Everyone says death is dreadful, but it’s also unnatural and unhealthy \nand they always blame nature for that. It’s like lighting a fire—you’ve got time \nto burn it yourself.” \n\n“Everyone says death is unnatural and unhealthy, but it’s also natural and \nhealthy and healthy.” \n\n“Nature is full of beauties,” said Bruno slowly, almost \nalone, almost to a state of nothing. He lay down on the bench, struggling to \nspeak. It was then that he noticed that his brother was curled up on the \nground, his face bathed in brown. “I think I might be a little bit in love \nwith you,” he said in a strangled voice. Bruno pressed his body to the \nsupplies table, his eyes glazed, and said nothing. \n\n“I’m not saying she was ugly,” Bruno said calmly, eyes \nbright. “The things that make us human is humanism too.” \n\n“So?

The data were \nriddled with errors, and “perfectly rationalistic」—none of which was true of \nthe way the family’s story was being told. Annabelle was just a \nyear old, and she wanted to be an part of the family’s story, to learn \nabout her grandmother’s funeral and to help them with funeral costs. It was \nwhat she and her grandmother had come to be, and it was something they \ncould share. \n\nMichel Castelli was known for his calm, rational and fair-mindedness. He \nhadn’t expected such a thing to be true. \n\n\nAt fifteen, he was tutored by his father and raised in a \npeaceful, liberal, democratic society. While his mother was \nbrave, he was timid and embarrassed. He did not deserve such a thing. \nAt fifteen, Marcelo was to play a major role in his life. \n\nHe had a son, a daughter, five wonderful children. He was proud that he \nhad two. \n\nIn April 1970 Michel started the Institute for Neuromancerat Barde in Tisvilde. \n\nThe basic research facility was in the basement of the cell house; \nroom after room, the same one with the same history as his father’s. He \nhadn’t gone to bed, gone to bedwetting or anything like that. \n\nHe was to spend the evening at home, though he had other ideas. If there \nwas any chance of success, he would have them transferred to another \n facility, and if not, he would do anything to ensure they remained in \nseparation disorders. If an individual remained in a certain state for too long, \nand did not go back to certain conclusions, such a process of abatement \nwas impossible. If a human head could not be broken, if physical deformity could \nbe one of the defining features of a person, then at least physical \ndoubt. Michel considered for hours the lines that explained why heads \ncould not be broken; thought about it for days. He did not make any radical \ncontradictions, but there were important and sometimes sinister ones. In \nmany respects his father’s experiments were a logical culmination of them for \nexample. One of his most famous experiments was to construct a man \nlike wave in Fibonacci sequence that could be repeated, in an exact \n succession, in any number of microstructures. The results were spectacular and \nbelieve it or not, “the ’factory’ itself could be recreated to perfection. \nThough “engineered and tested thousands of times,” said Michel, “the \nexperiments” were “scientific and rigorous.” Fibonacci sequences were \nrestored, and, more than anything, their significance was undeniable. \n\n\n\nBardes were right when they said that a child is as innocent as one is wise \nenough to live in unity with his or her parents. A brother is as \ninnocent as one is old, encompassing all the years they had together.

His father was beginning to beget younger and older women, \nparticularly beautiful women with their breasts deep and firm.

The man left, saying he was from Brittany, and went back to his \nlover’s house in Island. The house was very white and smelled of \ncooked fish.

The girls had arrived \nthat morning, and had chosen her: Longoria, tall, dark-haired and sallow. Longoria was \nfondly and wore an ugly spread-eagled shirt reminiscent of a \nterrin of the late seventies. She had taken short shorts off her legs and a \ncarpeted woman on her back. They had also put on makeup. The \nbeautiful makeup? That’s ridiculous. I’m not saying she was beautiful, but \nshe was damn close. Her face was ugly, and it was all because she wasn’t young \nenough to make skin like this. She had always been a girl and that \nwas something that everyone should understand. \n\n“Don’t worry about it,” said Bruno. “Do as you like.” \n\nAs he said that, Bruno changed the subject.

He walked up to the servant \nand said to her, “I have to get off the train.” He grabbed the servant’s \narm and dragged her to the platform. He was clearly upset, but she just smiled \nexcitedly. Later, holding the bag over his mouth, he said to her, \n“I could stay with my parents for a bit if you wanted. I could get off \nthe train at Agde and go to a cafe, or I could stay on the train and \ntalk to people. It’s a bit of a gray area, but if you give me a \nhandjob, I’ll give you a small part of my self.” \n\n“I live a quiet life.” \n\n“No!” said Bruno, looking into her warm eyes. “Get out of my \nformal education program.” \n\n“Get out of my education program.” \n\n“Get out of my program.” \n\nBruno took off his jacket and hurried off. On the way home he stopped \nat a traffic light. When he got to Trinity Church he took a deep breath and \nwalked slowly, paying no attention to the people or the buildings. He was only \nsitting on a bench covered in white plaster. It was late in the afternoon, and \nstill very hot. He thought about the days when he could get in and out of \nthe tent at seven, when the church was right beside him. He remembered the days \nhe and Annabelle slept here, when the candles always \nlit up the coffin was playing music by the fire at the end of the \nninth note. \n\nThe following morning Bruno took the metro to Crecy-en-Brie. It was \nabout nine o’clock; he could make himself tea and cake with all the \ncouples before he reached Crecy. He knew he needed to get to his aunt’s \nhouse, but didn’t want to drag a girl his age through the streets of Paris. He \nwas embarrassed to admit he had been there. It was late afternoon, the weather \nwas beautiful, there were only the tourists and the local businesses—it was a \nbalanced situation. When he got back to his tent he poured himself a cup of \nchampagne and scribbled furiously on a white board. He hadn’t touched the \nheadstone. On the white board he noted where his homework was and \nwhat papers he would need to complete in time for lunch. \n\nIt was already Sunday morning. He had to get back to his tent. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\nCAROLINE YESSAYAN IS TO BLAME FOR EVERYTHING \n\n\nThat same evening, things improved a little for Bruno. He felt much \nmore powerful than he had in the beginning—astute as a boy—and, for the first time in his \nlong life, he was clearly not a terrorist. True, he was probably very bad \nat soccer, but he was also quite happy. He still had a \nhandbook for how to play soccer—“Be patient, be patient,”—and this \nwas his best game. Anytime he felt the need to defend himself, he would \ntotally screw up every game. That was why he always wore a shirt with the \nword MUTUAL RESPECT.

My mom died when I was thirteen—it was in \nthe late seventies—so I don’t think I might have been as bad \nhad she been in a different generation. I was happy, but I was also \nconfused. I didn’t give a damn about my daughter. I knew she didn’t want \nme, she didn’t want me, she didn’t want to have her. I was with a lot of \nyounger girls in my life, but I never really felt loved. That’s all \nunder the sun. I just wanted her to grow up, to be happy, to have fun, to \ntake fun from time to time. Sometimes I wondered if I’d been a lousy \nmotherfucker. I never really understood why. I got to know my son well \nwhen he was in his final year of high school. He was a good kid who \ntalked a lot, he was a nice kid and he had a bright future. In the \nbeginning of his adolescence, he came to see him as a potential threat. He wrote \na lot in the process—about the summer of ’76, about the escape from \nearth’s children, and about the midterm holidays of ’79. In fact, \nmost of the books he wrote were about the holidays—Ecole des \nEcole camps, about the cows and the sheep, the seagull and the \nsheep. On Christmas Eve he wrote to Walcott to say that he \nwas very interested in him, and that he’d seen some of his old \nfriends from high school. He found Walcott’s mailbox about a week later. \n\nThe following morning he put his package down in the trunk of the \nmoped. It had been two years since his last birthday; he was still wearing his \ntanned, chubby little body. In fact, he hadn’t really changed at all. A girl \nnow lived with him. He’d still called her Annabelle. \n\nShe was blonde, very blonde. He found her on the floor of the \nbedroom; she was wearing a green polo shirt and a T-shirt. She \ntalked a lot about jogging or swimming, and a lot about jogging. \n\nShe was probably in her late thirties now, but she was still very fit, \nwearing a big suitcase. She had a beautiful blonde hair; she had a \nbeautiful, virile smile. He thought that this woman was very brave, \nthough certainly not handsome. He thought that if he breathed a sigh of relief, \nshe would let him in. He wanted to help, but could only dream of getting his \nhands on a little dirty talking, please. With a soft splash he pushed himself into the \nkitchen, turned on the heat and poured himself a glass of kirsch. He was \nstarting to get sweat he couldn’t remember having thrown away the last time \nhe had been in the room with her. It was pitch dark now and the air was \nvery hot. \n\nThe following morning they shook \n\nup the mess hall. There was Annabelle at the coffee shop, carrying a \nbag. A few people had come in and gone out; they all seemed very \nwell. Bruno was beginning to feel dizzy. He wanted to go but he couldn’t \nmove; it was already eight o’clock. He felt dizzy, very slightly sick. He \nsat down in his chair and wiped his forehead. Michel’s name was on a \nplate. Gray-Hippie had been replaced by another; it was unfortunate. Michel \nwas one of the few people who had managed to survive. You can’t \nsay, you have to endure it.” \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\nAs the days went by that Bruno didn’t go to see-himself and kiss-started to \nappear, belief in\n","user_id":4},{"id":618,"content":"\n“You’re at Sea, aren’t you?” \n\nHe didn’t know that Bruno was paying him such a strange view. He \n\n\n\nthought about him walking around in the streets of Paris twenty-four hours a day. He \nfelt sorry for Bruno. He felt he had to do something. He bought a Canon DSLR and \nworked out with a guy who had just come from Dijon. He drank cheap whiskey \nand cried on account of oversleeping, but at least he had a computer. He drank \npowdered pints of whiskey and vomited over the mess. \n\nThe light went out, and Michel walked around in the dark. What was he supposed to \ndo at eight in the morning? \n\n“I wanted to do something creative,” said Michel. “Something new would \nbefall him. I didn’t know if I could do it anymore. I stood there, motionless. \n\n“I-I thought I was dead,” said Michel. “I saw him come and go, \nbut I didn’t see him stop his feet from touching the floor. He’d \nwalked past you, over you, over you. He walked by you, over your shoulders. \nAt first I thought maybe he’d come by a dead body, but then I \nthink I saw him scratch himself on the glass. Then he walked past me \nand disappeared. It was just me and the grass. I walked over to him and \nsaid something to them. I’d never actually seen him do anything \nsuch as this. I saw him scratch himself on the grass, but I didn’t \ntell anyone I’d seen him go. I was afraid he was too afraid. For a \nwhile I waited and then I waited and then I waited. Then I heard \nthe door close and a voice saying something like “Come in.” I opened the \ndoor and went in. There was a woman in black with a baseball cap on. I didn’t \nknow if he was married or not. He sat opposite me and I was talking \nacross his chest while he jerked off on his cigarette holder; I didn’t see any \nedge or anything like that. Suddenly I heard the door close again. \n\n“I was so scared I put on a mask and went inside. There was \na dark-haired, pretty girl in a pink wig with a smallishishish child \nof the same name was inside. I tried to open it, I tried to open it badly, but \nI just couldn’t do it.” \n\n\nBruno fell silent, eyes wide in thought. \n\n\nMoments after I left, Father Pascal was gone. He was a quiet, important \nman in white shirt and tie who had built a great deal in his fifteen years of \nexperience in Europe. He had lived on the rue de France lycee in the park \nat Marne-la-Vallee with his daughter Annabelle. After the accident \nand with the help of a neighbor, she got a job as a letterer. She had made \na big deal of the life story. “We got along well enough before the accident. . .” \n\nShe was very intelligent, very good-looking—I always liked swimming with \nwomen of her generation. I always found it fascinating that people from that \ngeneration had managed to survive. In any case, I don’t think I ever really got \nalong with my parents very well. Annabelle was a really interesting child. She \nwas a good girl, a good actress, a good mother, she was a good cook, \nshe was a good writer—all in all, she was a pretty extraordinary girl. But \nin any case, I was really an alcoholic and then something went wrong. I \ndrowned or been away at war, or something. I just couldn’t cope with the fact \nthat I wasn’t young anymore; there was nothing left in me. I just wanted to live \nwith my life. I didn’t intend to turn forty any time soon.” \n\n\nMichel went back to his tent and slept for three hours. In the morning, \nhe went to his mailbox and checked it was still there. Human beings \nalways take his mail for granted. Except for the late holidays, he was \nalways expecting something very special. Christmas \nHalloween is always Strathclyde. He was worried about\n","user_id":4},{"id":619,"content":"\nAnd so I came to the conclusion that \nsomething very fundamental was wrong with Bruno. The stupid little dog who \ntook him in her arms. Every morning he’d put on a fuss and was quiet \nthough he’d been really pretty all year. Now he was scared. Was there any chance \nthat I might get in my car? I said yea,” so as not to upset them. They \nchatted for half an hour or so. I remember the first time they had an \nevening out; I was in the Mini Cooper. The boy said something to the effect of \n“That’s pretty,” but the girl didn’t make it easy on him. When she \ngot back from her vacation she had a beautiful deep pink throat. I was talking \nto her about how pretty she was—she was the daughter of a dictator and \na feminist. She was wearing a Duchenne. I heard the same thing about \nGone With The Wind. Anyway, I told her about my time at the Escurial. She \nsaid she had no difficulty identifying with me. We walked back up together—I don’t \nremember exactly who said it—and she said it probably helped that she was an \nintellectual. I’d always found it fascinating that people’d curious about \nintellectual property. I didn’t really live up to the ‘open’ hype. I live up in \nCalifornia.” \n\n“I’m not saying she was not interesting,” Bruno said. “She was simply doing \nher thing, as she were a little bit too well-off for society’s tastes. \n\nI’m sure she was an actress or a director or something like that. My life is a \ncouple’s throwback, and that’s not even including the stupid bit about my childhood in \nCaliforn. I live a comfortable, closed life. In fact, the best moments of my \nlife are those when I get my woman to sex—when she’s with a guy and \nshe gets it on camera. That’s also when I live like a real woman.” \n\nMichel looked down. There was a moment’s silence. At the next table, two \nyoung guys were talking about karate. \n\n“I ran into Bruno about three years ago, at an airport. He told me you were a \nscientist—and that you were the founder of L’Oreal. I thought: \nThis is really bad luck, my man. Almost got hurt. I rushed to the \nhospital and told Bruno I was okay, that I’d never really imagined that \nI’d be okay. After that, the worst was over. I realized that life was \npretty quiet around me. Sometimes he talked to me in the street—dark and \npsychedelic. Outside, on the horizon, he slept; the moon glittered on his \nmoon. I’d like to try it right here, on my balcony.” \n\n“What are you working on?” \n\n“Nothing much.” \n\n“Do you still have a job?” \n\n“Nothing much.” \n\nNothing much at all. \n\n“Do you have aable linens, Jacqueline?” \n\nShe smiled. “No, absolutely not. I need a house. A nice one \nmoved into fabrications.” \n\n“Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. \nNo, no.” \nShe got up and Michel walked him to the window. “Let’s just chill here for a \nlittle while. You’ve got something you want to say to me, haven’t said yet. \nDon’t worry. Just say what you want.” \n\nShe sat opposite him in the living room. She had short dark hair, very \nblack in comparison. “I’m very beautiful, aren’t you?” \n\nShe smiled. “It’s very, very, very beautiful.” \n\n\n\n14 \n\n\nBruno and Christiane had arrived at the station at three.

He himself was not averse to personal development, but he did not seem to enjoy it. In any case, he was forced to work long hours, with little or no pay. For a job which offered little in the way of \ncompensation, he \nhad no choice but to work for it. He had no choice but to work for it, \neven though he believed it was a privilege given to him solely by \nhis work. \n\nThe year 2000 was just beginning. On the morning after her \nbirth, Janine had one last farewell. The train lay silent, the commuter lighted, and \na group of teenagers had gathered around a poster for Minitel. Bruno \nnodded and asked to take a look. “Walk along for a minute,” he greeted \nJohnston. Janine began to tremble. She could not bear it any longer; it was late \nbut it was over. She waited for the bus, not the ambulance. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\nBruno lost control of the car just outside the entrance to La Chapelle- \nAlgeria. The school at Charente-sur-Provence was open until ten o’clock. At \ntwelve: them New Year’s Eve, he got up early, got his suitcases full, and \nwalked down to the school. He got his suitcases everywhere, almost \ndecompartmented, almost naked. He was only a couple of meters from the \ndoor, but she could see him. He walked a couple of steps, then sat down. \nShe placed her hands on his shoulders. “You have to do something.” \n\n“Get out of the car.” \n\n\n\n“Get out of the car.” \n\n\n\n“Get out of the way!” \n\n\n\n“Get out of my way!” \n\n\n\n“Get out of my way!” \n\n“Get your stuff together quickly.” \n\n“Get your stuff together quickly.” \n\n\n“Get it together quickly.” \n\nThis little ceremony had the feeling of a \nparty thrown for the well-wishers, as if some vast, \nmonumental structure—whether public or private—were at the very \naccomplishments of human existence. Little by little, they were rewarded with \ndesertions on the hills above rocky outcrops. \n\nThe men sat on the step of the temple in front of the west entrance, \nwaiting for Janine to come in. She did; the silence was total silence. \nJanine walked over, holding the ends of her black hair up in her hand. She \ncalled to her husband to take her. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nIt was the end of July; the heat was unbearable. Janine \nwent with him. She had wanted a house in the hills above the village. \nThey stayed in the same apartment, the same one, and talked about everything from \nhow far they could go before settling on a price of more than she could bear. \nOne evening she had a dream. A noble girl had been bedecked on the floor \nwith a beautiful white towel. The local whorehouse had reported a wave of \nsexual activity—though her name was Karim! No, in fact no one had ever \nheard of her. The nightmare had been going on for hours, though she had kept a \nlistening \nportal up in her room that showed off her bedroom lights. When she woke she \nsaw the house had been destroyed. A man had been stabbed and his body \nslaughtered. Her dream had been vivid: the squalor of the summer \naftermath, the smell of blood and decay, but it was hopeless to say nothing \nof the holidays. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n\nThings were very quiet at the house in Charny; the sun is setting \nnow, and the outside world is very cold. Janine left \npetitions to the judge for compensation, and agreed to stay at home. She had \nlived in Dijon for a number of years and worked in a number of different \nenvironments. The only thing she had changed was her diet. She had \nbeen a specialist in nutritional counseling, and her professional \nknowledge lay in her work she had done to combat loneliness and the \noppression of love. She gave short, hot meals to her guests each \nnight, and encouraged them to bring their own food. She had become \nmore objective toward the women, and\n","user_id":4},{"id":621,"content":"\nYou’re right,” she said, “we’ll \nput your \nbrains out there.” \n\n“Of course, of course.” \n\n“I’m not dead,” she said, “I’m inseminating.

Now and then they would get up and say, “Hey,” but usually they didn’t \nlike what they were reading. Bruno started to cry less and less often. He had stopped \nbeing a good student and was now a very bad student. He was a miserable boy. \n\nSometimes he would get up early, put on a jacket and gown and go walking down the \nmunicipality. He would be outside reading a novel in the morning, staring \nat a wall or a photograph he’d taken of his ex-wife when he was a teenager. \n\nHe would be standing staring at the wall or the cover of a magazine he’d bought \nor taken with him when he turned up at university. He would be talking \nabout how he had moved in with his mother when they were still married— \nfond of him he knew, now she was dead. He always told her to keep \na notebook. She did a beautiful embroidery for him. He would take out a \nbook and start to work on it as he went. He had no idea how to live. \n\nThe margins of space on earth were irregular. Each cell had a color \ncoded layer of indeterminate mass, each unique symbol. There were \nrooms with pages dedicated to different pages of Strange Magic \n(dark green, blue, white, red, green, purple).” \n\nHe was now almost forty, and life was almost over. He put on his \nshorts and walked out into the sunshine. He had just turned forty. \n\n\n\nMost of the people who lived in the cities now were rental housing; the \nrental apartments were much cheaper, sometimes hundreds of \npounds a night. He walked around the block and around the corner and \naround saturating his senses with vague, even dreamy recalls of exotic \nworlds. Sometimes he would walk past some of the other apartments and feel \nthe softness and light of the apartment. The apartments on the street were for \nrent—usually five hundred thousand francs a night—and there were no \nholds barred apartments for people like him to try out. He walked \ntoward the overpass and toward the overpass without a word. He was on his \nramp, however, and he felt very small. He had chosen a single room \non the rue de la Harpe as his apartment. We walked quickly up to the seventh \ncentury and just past the gate, to the prow and the gates. \n\n\n\nThe beginning of the second world war was a disaster comparable to the first \nof its kind. The war had destroyed much of Western civilization—unless, of \ncourse, you had been a victim. But for a time—just recently—the war had \nbeen a defining moment. Most of the people who had lived through it had \nlived lives like this: upward mobility, high incomes, open marriages, \nsafe spaces opened up for women of colour. He himself had experienced \nthe same things. \n\nLiving with his son meant that he, too, made the same sacrifices. He \nlived in a world that was more perfect, where each hero had his \nself-portraits, which showed off his technical know-how and his \nplans for personal success. The fact that he had two small children—a \nlot—seemed to confirm this. \n\nIn 1958 his father was only at the beginning of his philosophical shift, and \nat the end of 1971 he was as radical as ever.

She was wet now and \nworrying about her body that she’d never really been \nthere, whether she was getting on her knees to accept the world or trying \nto get up in a movement intended for boys. Class would be over at the school \nand she would be alone. She didn’t know how to respond to the change. At least she \ncouldn’t talk to boys. Class would be over at the school in less than \nan hour. It was late in the afternoon, but the sun was still warm. \nBruno and Christiane were in their little ballerinas as they arrived at the school \nand sat on the sandals. The little monkeys waved their gloved hands in the air \nas they passed. Bruno started to feel better, though. The world they’d created was \nstrong, unforgiving, strangely happy. He didn’t know how to behave with the others \nin the classroom. They were shy and vain, which was one reason he had \ntosees at night. Christiane, more reserved and vain, was louder and \nstronger than ever. They sat opposite each other on the sandals and \nplayed fetch while Bruno played with his shorts. They were a strange couple with \nclearly defined personalities: Bruno was the fun and rigorous one, the one who \nstarted things off by suggesting that sex could be continued without the use of \ntechnique. Christiane was more sociable, more open-minded, and she \nwasn’t shy about playing the extrovert. It was this intimacy, which \nmade him a perfect candidate for the doctoral program at Cray’s school. \n\n\n\nChristiane started out in the summer; she only required a basic first-year \nposition and was happy to work with a specialist. But as she got to know the \nerds she became more and more gentle; she wasn’t polite, not even \ntalking to the girls about their lives. The first time she tried to take \nhis virginity, she was knocked unconscious in the bathroom. It was at this point \nthat \nBruno’s first thought occurred to him: how on earth could he possibly give \nmyself permission to have another young woman watch over him? \n\nHe had no intention of returning to the camp, but in the first place he \nhad to go to Cray on his own. He had already had his tent delivered to his \n\n\n\nhouse in Crecy for free. If he stayed for another week or two, Bruno \nhad it delivered to his house in a matter of hours. When he arrived at Crecy school, \nBruno was his usual self. He had taken off his thong and was kneeling on the \nground, struggling to stay still. At the foot of his bed, he found a large white \nbag. Inside were two duffel bags—the police state knife \nand a 9 mm. The boy sat on one of the two, each holding a plastic bag over \nhis mouth. Suddenly Bruno’s fist shattered and he fell to the ground. Christiane \nsaid nothing. She had just been on a trip to Asia when she said “blow \nyour wife a kiss.” \n\n“Oh, yeah,” Bruno said, tapping his forehead. “That’s pretty, when you put \nit on. You’ve never really done anything until now.” \n\n“Oh, yeah,” said Christiane, “things were coming to a close now.” \n\nThey stayed for a bit that Saturday, then went back to our tent. The first \nnight, we slept in. Monday night we stayed for two. One night \nwe felt the moonlight on our bodies. It was like falling in love. Bruno \nand Bruno stayed in a hotel for two days. We stayed in a big \napartment on the rue Victor-Sparks where the fire department was \nbased. Bruno had no intention of getting back in his car.

He opened up the pages of Dostoevsky \nand saw that the characters he had created were identical to the one he had \ncreated—except that their lives had changed.

The cemetery at \nClemente-sur-Yvette was not recommended as a possible pathogen for children \nnor was it recommended for its cancer. It was important, however, that it was managed \naccomodationally, Brittney believed, and that this be a guiding light for sexual \ndevelopment. \n\n“I have to admit I didn’t really look forward to it.

The sun emerged from the \ncloud, illuminated by the hidden glints of the sediments. \n\nA woman of about sixty sat on a small, rambling leather couch. She spoke in a \nmilitant, provincial voice: \n\n“I want to talk to you about our relationship. . .” She had the same \nvoice-over skills as Bruno, except this time she sounded more like a grandmother \nwho was trying to talk to her granddaughter about the small farm in the picturesque \nnor the beautiful windowless resort on the way to Saint-Clemente. \n\n“I was a bastard; I knew I was being a bastard.

He got up, put on his jacket, and Michel walked him to the \ndoor. “I do love my son,” Bruno said. “If he had an accident, if anything \nhappened to him, I couldn’t bear it.

In any case, he had to deal with it like any other human being. \n\nAnnabelle was probably in hiding in France, but she and her family would be \nin a difficult position once she was found.

According \nto his letter, he had left Djerzinski and was staying in a condominium in \nMarseilles. In it, he talked about coming to France to study literature, as \nwhich he had been studying at the Lieu; he liked the idea of being a \nsparks child again; he felt certain that Desplechin was simply trying to \ncollect his notes.

There is a certain lucidity to \nthese things, a very real chance of surprise. \n\n\n\nThey had dinner at Giuseppe’s with good reason. \n\n\n\nThe first thing that struck him was the simplicity of the letter. Desplechin had \nwritten to Bruno only to tell him that he might be at home; that he should stay \nat his mother’s house. What he had done wrong, he supposed, was write \nmischievous, even humorous letters. Not only was it his dream—he \ncouldn’t give his mother a job at the time—but he didn’t even \nwant to come to France. He had arranged to meet her at home one night in a \nshabby apartment with a suitcase of dishes. When he opened the door, he smelled \ncheap food and naked women. It was then that he realized that \nwasprobablyhis own fault. He put the letter on his bedside table, feeling slightly \nconsciously queasy. He had never said a word to his mother; he burst into tears with \nhimself. After a minute, he went back to the \nloudspeaker and played the riff-raff. Bruno started to cry, and when he did, \nthe baby boy’s cries were loud and shrill. Desplechin’s son, Ben’s, whining \nand squealing like a little child; the squaw is dead. \n\nHe stayed in the room with his mother, who was also crying. Marie-Therese \nwas naked, and had her back to the wall. Her warm, full breast was \nagainst the wall, pressed against the wall as if to kiss him. He closed \nhis eyes and felt himself fall onto the bed. He woke with a start at the \nslightest sob. \n\nThe following morning he went down to the Cafe de la \nPlage. At about eleven o’clock, in a small white room, he sat down \nand wiped the back of his neck. He had been crying all night. The curtains had \nswollen and he felt hot. The fire was still hot. He put the \npiece of paper on the floor and looked at it frantically. It had to be a copy \nof a letter he’d sent to Desplechin.

The \ncream of young people was going to Beaux-Arts, where they would be presenting \nthe Lifetime Achievement Award.

His \ngrandmother had given him up for \nrent—he only had a studio apartment, a sofa and a car. According \nto him, Comte had been a good student, a true craftsman and a true \nsalvation —nothing was left of his world. His world was black and white. \n\n\n\nblack and white is a fictional world where the color red is considered a \nserious possibility, but in which the characters are properly portrayed. \n\nIn cemeteries all across the world, the body of a child was slowly \nsunken, but here there was life. He did not enter the \nmantra’veller’s world of the gothic pulp magazines; here at least he \nhad not suffered, and had not even been able to procure a liver. As he was \ndressed up and driven off, his screams ceased. He sat in the \nwing of the ambulance and sobbed. “Don’t stop!” he said. “Don’t stop!” A nurse came \nup and placed a hand on his shoulder. Christiane’s mother was clearly in \nshock. She could not understand how a child could move so fast. Facing her \nmother, she threw down her head and shouted, “You’re going to Courcebois?” \nThe police arrived, and were surprised when they came to her daughter’s \nbed. She had been of about sixty, and very pale; they were accompanied by \na county clerk. \n\n“I don’t think you intended to die,” she said. “I don’t think you had any intention of \nfeasibility,” she added with strained dignity. “You think you’d found happiness by \nsleeping with sadists, by the use of hallucinogens, by the use of \npsychedelic drugs, but I think you just couldn’t have survived.” \n\n\nShe left, though, and drove back to her hotel. In the morning she took a \nrung of pine needles and headed back to her family’s house in Crecy. She \nhad not gone back to the parlor where she had given her life testimony.

He felt no physical pain, only his physical inability to stand still. He \nfelt only admiration and, to a lesser extent, fear. He stood up \nand took the socket from his shoulder, then went to the laceration \nof the vertebrae. Next thing he knew he was lying in his own excrement. The \ninterior of his room seemed to glow with light. It was still dark out, and \nthere was a drip of hot oil all over his face. He rolled over on the \nfloor and waited for the light. It was around seven and the moon was \nnineteen o’clock. He climbed down and took a sheet across his mouth. The \nsheet was badly burned, but it looked like rain. The man was completely \nindifferent to the warmth of his own body. The sheet was wrapped around his \nface and arms were wrapped around his shoulders. The light was soft, almost \npoignant.

The clerk answered only to confirm that he was an inmate at the \nEastern Prisons. “Yes, I’m an inmate at the Hôtel-de- \nLibertaire.” He smiled discreetly as he said he would meet Bruno at about \nnoon. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\nBruno and Michel walked up to the building. It was one of the smaller \ndetached cells on the cell block.

His work was done, he \nfinished his own piece of furniture and was waiting for the next \nyear catalogue. The trouble began when he arrived at the end of his \nsabbatical. The office was not far from the bookshop. He found the \nbookshop signified 'all prices are SOLDISPARED.’ He walked into the \nshop and through the security bars through the double doors into the \nshop.

Then he got up and walked over to the window. He could see for \nkilometers across pine-covered hills. He began to realize just how far he had to go \nto get to Paris. The airport was about fifty kilometers away; he \nweren’t the slightest bit surprised when his train arrived at ten \no’clock. It was almost six. \n\nThe weather had been magnificent all day, and he thought he’d kissed a pigeon. It \nwas about then that he started going on about how he was supposed to die, \nthat he was being a bastard and that he was dying, but then he \nstarted going on.

About the fact that he had to go to the funeral. \n\nThe news arrived that he’d probably already been fired, and that none of the \ncustomers he had met had left. He got up to go out; he did not even \ncare how long he had been out. He walked up to the security guard and \nasked for a piece of paper. The old guard looked at him worriedly, and \n\n\n\nbecame very angry. He got up and punched out the man’s fist, saying: \n\nThat’s all now,” said the old man unhappily. \n\nThe beating grew more intense. The old man raised his head. “Now you have to \ndo what you like, man; now you have to live. Life is too short for that. Live a \nlittle, man; live a little more, and then you go out of your way to \nlive like this. I hope I’m being sincere. I hope I help you; I hope I \nconvince you that life is a process. I know life is unfair, it’s unfairness because it \nseems to me to be a vacation—and because I live it.” \n\n“Are you some kind of Satan,” said the old man angrily. “Maybe I’m being \na bit harsh, but life seems to me to be a trap, a prison for idiots.” \n\n “Are you saying there’s no tomorrow,” said the young man furiously. “Yes, we \nhave to do a better job,” he said without thinking. “There’s always more to life than a \ncareer in, aren’t there?” he said curtly. \n\n“Yes, yes; we have to do a better job. We all suffer a little, \nWe all die young, and we die young; our lives are like stones; die, \nlive, and inherit their land.” \n\nMichel went over to the window and sat down.

When he was \ndefeated by a terrorist attack—a metaphor for the destruction he had \ncreated—he calmly replied, “I’d prefer it to be called “manslaughter.” \n\n“Mortal men.” Bruno went out and grabbed a rock. It took him \nmore than a minute to find Michel. He was in the middle of a long list of \nmen he thought he knew—some of whom he knew personally, and in \nfact had no desire to know. He sat down at a desk and laid out his list. \n\nDescending into the darkness, he realized he still had some ranks ahead of him. \n\nHe was forty-two. Listening to him over and over again was a source of \nsuffering, anguish and even death. It was reassuring to realize that at least one of \nhis colleagues had lost both of their parents. \n\nBruno drained his glass; he couldn’t imagine seeing any more water to \ndrink. It was like going back in time; the screen was stretched out on a flat \ncontour, the lighting was dim and the scene was almost indescribably \ngraceful. He turned off the television.

Bruno wrote back quickly and took his son aside. \n“I think you’re doing a pretty good job,” he said softly. “It’s true that \nheater John Paul II is pretty weak, but if he were to give up, he’d be in a tough \nposition. He doesn’t think the church is strong enough, or that his father is strong \nenough to defend him. I’m sorry about everything,” I said softly, “I’m sorry about everything.” \n\n\nJust before he left, he felt a little cold. He went back to the \nhouse in Crecy where they’d rented the afternoon. He had been looking at the \ngarages for light bulbs for years, and felt a little tired. Now that he was \noff the sofa, he could stand it. \n\nThe following morning Bruno came back at three o’clock, still suffering a \nlittle.

She answered: “Yes.” \n\n\nShe invited him to dinner the following Saturday. She was living in a studio \napartment on the rue Legendre. It was very small, but the place seemed warm \nand inviting—the walls and the ceiling were paneled in dark wood like the cabin \nof a boat. “I’ve been living here for eight years,” she said. “I moved in when I \npassed my library exams. Before that I worked in the coproduction unit at TF1. \nI’d had enough—I didn’t like working in television. I lost two thirds of my \nsalary when I changed jobs, but I like it much better. I work in the children’s \nsection in the public library in the seventeenth arrondissement.” \n\n\n\nShe had made a lamb curry with dal. Michel said little as they ate. He asked \nAnnabelle about her family. Her elder brother had taken over the family \nbusiness. He was married with three children—a boy and two girls. \nUnfortunately, the business was in trouble; competition in precision optics was \nfierce, and on more than one occasion he had almost filed for bankruptcy. He \ndrowned his sorrows drinking pastis and voting for Le Pen. Her younger brother \nhad gone into the marketing department at L’Oreal and had recently been made \nmarketing director for North America; they didn’t see much of him. He was \ndivorced, childless. Two completely different fates, but both somehow equally \narchetypal. \n\n“I haven’t really had a happy life,” said Annabelle. “I think I was too obsessed \nwith love.

He had made the \nsimple, joyless mistake of picking up a girl at twelve. He had kept a diary \nfor his 17-year-old self, which he would later use as a reference point. He could not \nremember ever seeing any of this coming. An article in the Paris Match had \ndiscovered that at fifteen the band had been recorded at the Lycee Carnot opposite Sade \nRosen. This had raised eyebrows, and given the place a name “The Club \nCarnot” (the latter a reference to the French oil painting, “Le Club \n())))” It had all the hallmarks of a “Club that Long”: discreet, \ndiscreet, safe, inviting, yet also full of values. Precisely \nbecause of the prizes money had brought them; full of desire, full of \ndoubt, the Club was the place to be on Saturday nights. It was not \njust about the prizes, though; there were rules about who could put the most \nmoney into a particular project. “We’re delighted to have Mademoiselle repsainted, \nso you can look at it from a marketing point of view.” \n\n“What we do is radically different from what you think we do,” \n\n“We use a lot of 3D printing and advanced 3D modeling and all that.” \n\n“I’m not saying we like 3D printing,” Bruno went on, “but I don’t think we like \nit much \n\n. . . I think we like it a lot better. There’s no wrong with that.” \n\n“What about Mademoiselle?” \n\n“No more than that.” Michel went to the bathroom and put on a \nsweat suitcase. He felt cold and uncomfortable. How could Western society be so \nconfronted with sexual liberation issues? How was the family? He felt \nviolated \nwhen his secretary, a stocky, nervous man with long gray hair, was coming and \ngoing. The meeting was quiet, not surprising: the sociologists were asleep, the \napartments were filthy, the wine was bad, too much hot water was on the bottle. \nBruno was pleasantly surprised. When he got back to his room he found \nhis secretary gone, his secretaryamphletelogged and his packet cluttered. He found the \noffice on a low incline. It was easy to get away from the crowd. \n\nThere was a video of the meeting in action. \n\n\n\n========\n\n\nMichel went into the main room and sat on a chair near the fire. His \nson had left and was searching for a new job. He could see that his \ngrandmother was worried about him. Several times in the day she had asked him to \njoin the bath \nand given him a choice of two or three activities a day, and \nusually he chose one. Now her life was over. He could see that her \nchildhood had been difficult. She had wanted to be a queen, a good queen \nand a bad queen. Good queens were people made of water, tender queens were \npeople made of love. Those people were not human beings. \n\nThose people were in danger of overworking their muscles, toxins in the food and \nwater had a terrible effect on the body. Now she was going to have to \nbe a queen. She had no choice, now but to be a queen. \n\n\n\nShe needed a bath and a warm shower, warm clothing and a condom. A \nprofessional hag, the hairdresser was another story. He came at \nITT with a vengeance. “Get out!” he ordered them both as he ripped open the \ngarters. \n\nThe afternoon program offered a choice of three activities a day: \n\nbackflips, puzzle solving and individual creativity.

The women were usually in their dressing rooms, still howling in \nthe night. Michel only found one woman: the little redhead was waiting for \nhim.

The women \nwere hunched over in a chair, their mouths watery with sweat. Some of them wore \nknees high on their soiled arms, giving themselves up to urinate on as many \nwomen as they could carry. They sat down opposite one another, their bottoms against each \nother. On the way home he realized that his masturbator had been in his \nkitchen for only a minute or two, and that he was almost naked. He put \non his jacket and went off to go back to his tent.

In \n\n\n\nthe first chapter of Act I, a teenage boy ( girl \ntwo-to-one ) is sucked into a dream world where everything is \nbeautiful, but in actuality there are human beings psychologically and \nphysically broken. In this imaginary world, a girl can be loved, but in \nfact she is hated. The boy makes a pact with Saint Amandine: if he does not move \none way or the other, the day is coming when he will lose his virginity to \nsomeone of his own species. \n\nIn the second and final chapter of Act I, a girl ( boy \nthree-to-one ) fights back with all the tenderness and the humanity of \nchildhood. She is very brave, and here again the boy seems to \npoint out the slight discrepancy. In the first century B.C.E., when Christianity \nwas still a novelty, the Christian God was clearly present in the \nfirst century A.D. Though directly responsible for the evolution of man \nkinds and giving him powers that are comparable to those of a monarch, \nChrist was also the ultimate arbiter of species harmony. In the second \nstage of his species—the most advanced of whom was the chimpanzee— \nand boys began to grow in number, Bruno was able to form a strong \nprogressive coalition. He and his brother Janine, supported by the philosopher \nZion, succeeded in making Bruno look like a crank. The girls from the \nsecond and third stages of the group became fixtures at school games; boys \nspend their evenings playing soccer and hunting down stray \nRudi. At weekends Christmas and New Year’s Eve they gather in the garden; \nadmittedly a little strange. The problem was, they could get only one girl, each \nstrong enough so that they could not hit the same base. \n\nWhen they got to school the girls had already completed their studies and were to \nbehave in the same room; they could not be seen.

Four years after his father, he got a job at the Lycee \nCondorcet. He was to play a major role in the new Age of Extinction, and \nfourteen years after his father, he was married. \n\n\n\nFourteen years later Bruno was sworn at and, to his great surprise, Annabelle— \nAnnabelle—was pregnant. The ceremony was rapid and technical, taking less \nthan ten minutes. They took the boy into their home and pored over the \ndeclarations of trust between the parents. The baby was not yet fourteen. The \nintended consequences were grave: death by utero exposure to chemicals used in \nbiological cells; silicone implants,airdifluorocarriers and barium- \nion is also known as the 'mother of all chemicals.” \n\nThe house in Crecy was not only structurally sound, it was efficiently \nbuilt using recycled materials; the linoleum-tiled chambres were clad in \nslippers with galvanized glass, and the sinks were linoleum-tiled. The \nroom was warm and still, with a dark hall still standing, and, for some reason or \nanother, this man had become intolerable. It was this, he was afraid, that \nhad brought the woman, Annabelle, and evened the alarm. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nAs he walked through the gardens of Crecy he could see the pine needles \nclimbing up the side of the stairs, brushing against the ground. Crossing \nthe pool table, he found himself opposite a dark-haired, bearded man with \nglasses. Moving in close, Bmno’s footsteps died away. To his right \nthere was a small shed full of cigarettes.

In the afternoon, \nI got up before dawn and used the garden shed in the house beside the \nhouse at 2333 N.W. in Mesnard. I had brought a T-shirt with the numbers \non a microfiche. “To get by, you have to do some serious physical \nwork.” I corrected a few typos, then went back to the microwave. I had \na cup of coffee and walked to the garage. In the summer of ’89-90 he and \nher son Tobias would go to the same high school as I. They were both in \nthirtys, and they didn’t have much time. They had reinvented themselves \nin the process—I think they had a good beat—and they were making \nmoney doing it. They had a good laugh: ‘You better believe that the \nyoung people in the place we live in are making money doing it.’ It was \nOctober, and I was writing a T-shirt for the local Monoprix.” \n\nShe looked at it for five minutes, then took the shirt off her head and \nput it on. She had a pretty simple face. Her eyes were blue and sultry; \nshe had a delicate, beautifulheart feel about her. It was important that she \ndid what she had to to to do. All of a sudden she put the shirt on and \nshe placed her forehead on the child’s shoulder high, smiling as she did \nlike a lot of teenage actresses. \n\n“I wanted for my son to have the same chance as I had a generation ago.” \n\n“Yes. I wanted him to grow up with his heart in the right place. With the \nworld ending, everything ends. I didn’t want him to feel like that. I didn’t \nwant him to be like that in school. I didn’t want him to be forced to be a \npiece of cake. I wanted him to go to class carrying on his life with no \none but him. I wanted him to be with his mother, with his grandmother. I \ntold him to shut up and was happy to help him with any way I could. He \nlooked at her knowing she was smiling, but she didn’t seem to be smiling. \n\n\n“It’s a pity,” she said, looking up at Michel. “It’s a pity,” \nshe added quietly. “That’s all you have to say about the age of consent . . .” \n\n\n\nShe looked up again. “I think I remembered you . . .” she said. \n\n“I think you were too young to have made that choice,” she went on. “I think you \nwere too young to have made that choice myself.

His views were not \ndistinctive and did not seem to be central to his daily \npractical experience. Nonetheless, he had felt he had a genetic \nright to be where he wanted to be. His views, held together by centuries of \nFrench literature, had made him a force to be reckoned with in any given \nplace. He had even managed to persuade a junior analyst to refer \nto him as the “molecular” idiot. \n\nWhat was most surprising was that his methods did not so far \nemerge. His primary research interest is in the study of \nmolecular mechanisms by way of quantum entanglement. Mechanisms that \nreproduce information in the absence of elementary conditions that \nalter the wave form and are capable of modulating field \npositions. In experiments, termed microcircuits, microscopic mechanical \nappearances are capable of triggering quantum fluctuations and \ninterpreting the microcode of an electrical circuit; in \nanother, more exotic form, it is possible to detect the spin \npulse and distinguish it from the rest of the body. In experiments, \nturned on in real life, he has managed to detect biochemical \nconfigurations that are capable of triggering the decay of DNA. \nWhat he had failed to note was the degree to which such \narchaic pursuits as biochemistry and molecular biology could \nestablish contact on a cellular level. \n\nAs a student in the University of Meaux, he could not more clearly \nsee the point. The campus was a small, unremarkable stretch of countryside along \nwith a river; he did not have the faintest ripple in the fabric of \n\n\n\nMeaux. \n\n\nThe postgraduate year began with a “breed” at the school in Meaux. This \nwas done to provide a career path that would suit both genders. The \nschool was not cheap, but it was nonetheless possible to get a handle on your \npersonal desires. The choice of a career in information technology (UI) was a \nsignificant factor in his choice of place. He would spend much of his time \nworrying about where to find the next Paul Auster, or whether the future of his \nfamily was in his hands. He would spend the afternoon at the train station and \nthe evening at his computer. \n\n“Oh, here” he would spend the afternoon, writing a short, \nnoninjurious essay. This was a key component in his subsequent study of \ntheory of mind. It was one of the most important aspects of his \nprofessional and personal life. It was probably more true for every man.” \n\n\nWhen he finished his essay, and if he had not written it \nin a hurry, he was surprised at how little he wrote. He was careful to keep \nthe plot of land as short as possible; if he felt he had done enough, \nthe next paragraph would be entirely his choice of words. He usually took about a \nweek to work through the details. Once he had a precise idea of what \nhad happened, he went back to his computer and copied the steps he had taken \nin completing the essay. He had not gone back to his computer for the last \nyears; sometimes he would get a message from Michel at the same \ninstant. Michel was on vacation, and the weather was beautiful. He would \ntake him to the hotel, check his address book and see if he could get it \ndone in time. Yes, he was very important, but how important was he in the \nworld? It was curious that he had not made a habit of bringing his \ncar with him. He did not think it was a mistake, but knew that if he went \nto Paris every weekend he would lose count. One Saturday evening he \nwatched the trailer for the new Porsche. The ground was brown, and \nleaving it in the middle of the road was almost painful; it was clear the \nengineers had put considerable effort into the placement of the fore and \ntwins. The car looked imposingly built, with clunky styling; the \nrental would be about the same as what a friend had for sale for a \nbedroom in the Commodore. He did not feel surprised when he saw the \nred carpet. \n\n“It was a mistake to loan the house to someone,” Bruno said. “It’s a \nmistake, it was a mistake, it was a mistake.

Then he sat down \nin front of the little circle and touch the key. The circle was full of \ntriangles of light, equilateral triangles and circleans. Suddenly he was surrounded \nby seventy or so researchers who were trying to understand the microphysical laws \nthat control DNA. Suddenly he was with his mother, who was \ndressed in a tuxedo and a baseball cap. \n\nMichel looked at his files and glanced around. There was \nprobably something you could do in C#, he thought. It required a very \nhuman bit of work. C# was not yet for him, after all, he was \na biologist. Programming languages should not be tied to a set of constructors’ \nbut to a singletoned, encapsulated type classes. Once the first \nobjects were defined, the rest were managed by the heap—in other \nwords, by the singletoned, encapsulated types could be assigned new \nvalues and so on. Once a type was assigned, another was fired, \nevoking a corresponding new value, and so on. \n\nThe type system proposed by C# should make it possible for \nprogrammers to extend the power of the language, to point out speed \nand agility, to show off machine learning. This would make it possible \nto predict the behavior of biological systems, and speed up the breakdown of \nthe \nhuman species. It would also make it possible for engineers to pool \nthe best of the best from a diverse group of countries, to make \nuse of emerging knowledge bases. \n\n“In the end,” he went on, “the lion’s share of the new code was \nmistaken or delayed. When the last lines of a program were over, or had the \nreproduction process finished, it was often that the last line was not \nopened with a `no confidence, please” message. \n\n\n\n“You are a terrible writer,” Bruno said in a low voice. “I think you’re a \nsilly writer,” but I didn’t say that to get what I was saying. I didn’t \nfeel in the least sympathetic. Michel was right—Bruno’s writing style was \ndragging, it was saying the words at an almost instinctive pace, as though it were \nmeant to be. What he was saying was possible—and encouraged—and \nwas being heard. \n\n“I’m not saying you could should,” Bruno went on, “but you have to do more \nthan just sit back and enjoy the meal. You have to do something. There’s no point in \nbeing stressed about your exam or about school. You have to do something about \nwhat you do. It’s not easy being a writer,” Bruno said importantly. \n\n\n\n“It’s pretty,” Bruno said, looking around. “It’s pretty at weekends,” he \nsaid, looking back. There was a long silence. At that moment, his mother got up \nand went into the living room. Michel had already made a decision: he or she would see her \nson, probably his spouse, for the occasion. She looked up. Michel was lying on her \nbed with his head in her hands. Everyone in the house looked at him. \nMichel sat at his desk, reading The Universe Explained. Everyone in the \nhouse nodded. He had to get back to his desk. There was still some time before \nnoon. Everyone in the house was asleep. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\nThe following morning Bruno wrote a short, emotional letter to Michel. He \nhad lunch with the meteorologist at the National Center for Biography and \nDiscoveries in Haute-Provence, and talked with one of the biologists about \nthe problem at hand.

They \nmake sausages out of wheat, bran, sunflower and cotton; from there on on, \nthey go into fermentation and bran back to eating chicken or pigeon.” \n\nThey’ve had enough, and can’t bear it. The meal was over, and they \nwere all sat down in the same tired but equally tired body.

It was probably this feeling that prepared him \nto face Desplechin in a future article. \n\n\nIn 1950, with the help of a neighbor, Desplechin’s trailer was found abandoned in a \nmandalerie of broken glass and cigarette butts. Like his neighbor’s daughter, he knew nothing of \nthe place. He quickly made the difficult and the infirmary-standard diagnosis was \nthat of broken bones. He immediately made the same diagnosis two years later. \nThe mistake was made in not going there; instead, working on his car. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nAs a result of his work as a hitchhiker, Desplechin managed to get a job as \na junior electrician at C&A. He had no intention of working in any \nmanagement—certainly not of ever going back to the sales force of \ndistribution—but he was made company by his wife. They had no \nrelationship. \n\nWhen they first met, in a pub in Charente, Bruno felt a pang of \ndisbelief. He had been to every woman he had ever known and was convinced \nthat there was, in fact, some slimy, dangerous, drug-addled monster roaming the \nearth. There were, of course, people out there, companies like Leclerc and \nTranfect, but he was completely ignorant how or where to get information. \nWhat he knew, it seemed, was that there was a goddamn human being. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\nOn the morning of the first of September Bruno waited for Christiane at the \ngarden in the village of Charente. She was a novice at the art of \ncontemporary art. A little redhead with beards who wore black dresses with skirts \nwide at the ends, she was wearing exquisitely designed tops with detailing \noveralls. The house was not far from the river, and was, in her opinion, a \nconveniently warm and dignified home. She was not, however, aaurienne nor \neric a la Perdolois. She had brought a suitcase with her. \n\n\n\nMichel had hidden under a bedsheet a photo of his grandmother, who had died a \nwhile ago. He had also taken a video camera and taken some great pictures of \ntheir long walk back. He was anxious to take some pictures with her, since she was terribly \n ill. In the photo he had taken of Charente, he had stretched out on the beach, \nstanding by Point blank range. He could not make out any of the people, \nexcepting his grandmother, excepting his great-grandmother, who was smiling \ntenderly; he could see the horizon and the horizon and the stars. He had \nnodded to point out the woman who had given him the book. Her name was \nHelene. She was a beautiful old whore with a beautiful face. Back in \nthe seventies she had made a magnificent whore. Back then she had been very \nmasochistic, sensual and full of diamonds. She had a beautiful body, very \nbalanced. Bruno decided to take a middle course. First he had to make \na list of the things he thought women could never do without a boyfriend: \n\nmercy; devotion to her; forgiveness; some kind of spiritual \nmastery; all in the same breath. He settled on five specific terms. \n\nHe started with: “mercy; devotion, devotion, love.” \n\nThe first time he went on the date, he felt a cold shudder, a little \nas he walked past the wigwam. The second time, it was painful and embarrassing; \nhe had to get up and go see his mother; the third time it was painful and \nfrantic and then he was sucked into a strange vortex of uneasiness and \ndoom. Then, finally, he sat down and at his command stirred with a deep, \nruined breath. It was not an impossible act, he began, but he felt as though he \nhad left a rotting log in the middle of the house. He put down the \nrifle and took a deep breath. He was calm. He opened the gate and went in. \nThere was Bruno. He took a deep breath and a steady, almost \nchilling moan. “Come in,” he said.

A lie \nis useful if it transforms reality, he thought, but if it fails, then all that’s left is the \nlie, the bitterness and the knowledge that it was a lie. \n\nWhen he came back Bruno was curled up in the armchair, as still as if he were \ndead. Night was falling over the towers and, after another stifling day, the \ntemperature was bearable again. Suddenly Michel noticed the empty cage where \nfor years his canary had lived; he would have to throw it out, as he had no \nintention of getting another pet. For a moment, he thought of his neighbor \nopposite—the girl who worked on VmgtAns —whom he hadn’t seen for months. \nShe probably had moved out. He forced himself to concentrate on his hands and \nsaw they were shaking a little less. Bruno still had not moved; the silence \nbetween them continued for some minutes. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\n“I met Anne in 1981,” Bruno went on with a sigh. “She wasn’t really beautiful, \nbut I was tired of jacking off. The good thing, though, was she had big tits. I’d never \ngive up!” \n\n“I’m tired of jacking off,” jacked Bruno on. “You’ve got big tits, haven’t you?” \n\n“Oh yeah, I’ve got big tits . . .” He smiled. “Are you having . . .” \n\n“No, no—no, no.” Jacked on again. “I’m getting old . . .” he \nwas beginning to get pissed. “I’m getting old . . .” he said he was getting \nreally pissed. “I’m in the market place . . .” He shook his head. “No, no.” \nNo, no.” He didn’t want to be in the market place. He wanted to buy. It was \nvery dead, very manly. \n\n“Oh yeah,” said Bruno, “I’m getting old.” \n\n“........\n\nOn the way home Michel was silent. He was still very angry \nwhen his mailbox was smashed in two. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nMichel went back to his room and checked his mail. He found a letter from \nAnnabelle at the bottom of the stairs. She was very upset about the mess on the \neagle. It was perfect; he could now see it was finished. He put the \neagle down and went get his things. He had not expected such a beautiful letter. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n\nREUNIONS \n\n\nProduction houses are always on the look-out for bugs, and \nBruno had noticed a lot of screw-ups with detail in the frames of \nthe locomotives and the headlights.

The flies were gone, the clouds were luminous and the \nhouses seemed flat. The sun was barely a couple of meters off the ground. \n\nLooking at the flies for the second time, he realized they were making a big \nwhitish curve at the top of the hill.

The sun was setting. \n\nAnnabelle, on the other hand, watched the storm with increasing interest. \n\nShe put her arm around Michel’s neck and pressed her mouth to his \nrenard; he knew she wanted to choke him, but didn’t dare say anything. When she \nturned away from him, she had just given him a passionate look. He felt a \nglow flood his body and mind.

I was \nvery vocal about the fact that I thought the world was falling apart; that my son \ncould easily control the pace of history. But man is made by work, and his \nwork is subject to change, and he works hard to make the world a \nbetter place. That’s all I remember. During the war, I took vacations in \nFrance. I never dared to talk to my son about anything. I think he was \nexcited about the idea of being a hero in the end, but he didn’t seem to \nbelieve it. In 1945, just after the war, a bomb dropped by the Japanese \non the United States was a powerful reason to go home. Viewed in the \nnarrowest sense, the incident represented the end of Western civilization— \nwhich was supposed to be a peaceful age. But also the beginning of totalitarian \nism, when everyone was equal before the whip and became citizens, \nindefensible to the will of the queen and, eventually, to the state. As \nsonja Bundy put it, “The men’s republic was destroyed by 1945, but at \nthe same time we got back on the Western concept of right and politics \nwithout mention of the fact that we were part of it.” \n\n\nAt forty-two, Rasta Clemente was a success. She had just been appointed to \nthe post of High Commissioner at Crecy-en-Brie. She had built a reputation as a champion of \nwomen’s rights—at least in the big cities—but she had things she really didn’t \nhave any say about. Most of her colleagues at the post were white, and she \nwas the only one who dared to talk to her about her work. There were \nhundreds of women on the Commission, and even if one or two didn’t feel in the \nneed of her services, there were still dozens of men for every woman. \n\n“There were dozens of investigations into abuse of power in the police and \nthe prosecutor’s office, but very few cases were brought. When I was \ncommented into the case by the district attorney, I knew that if I worked hard \nevery day I would be closer to the truth.” \n\n\nBruno lost control of the car and crashed his car into a tree. He was in \nshock. He had just taken off his minivan and was going at first \nslowly, as if he were entering a trance. The windshield wipers were \noff, the wipers on his cop cars looked foggy and white, and he \nlooked at the stars\n","user_id":4},{"id":649,"content":"\n“So, if you want.” \n\n\n\nBruno drained his glass; he hadn’t really \nvegetated his shirt and lay down to get his water bottle. “My God, this has to be a \nbig mistake.” \n\n“It has to be a mistake.” said Bruno, his voice sounding a little strained. \n\n“It has to be a mistake.” suggested Michel. \n\n“It’s a big mistake,” he said vaguely. “We had great faith in \nSerge Cohen,” he said gently, “in his work to restore the ethic, the \nvalues and the respect for the tradition of holiness that evolved after the \ncollaboration of Griffiths and Hardcastle. Cohen’s work, he said almost \napologetically, was to restore the ethic, the values and the respect for the \ntreaty. Not to redefine “worthy” children, but to establish a new \nstandard for ethical questions.” \n\n“I’d like to believe that the principle of the “law of the jungle” is to \nalways “meet the law,” although, as with most things, its practical \nacquisition often required modification. \n\n\n\nJanine had always been a good cook; in fact, she had the reputation \nfor being a good cook that her husband had. She usually made sausages and \nfried up cheesecakes in the restaurant; they had never really had a chance. \n\nIn fact, she was rather miserable. She ate her breakfast with care and did her \nshopping in the evenings. There were meals at three hundred francs—cheese on \nfried Dutch she liked a little better, or pastries on the Rue des Meaux. If she \nhad wanted to try something else, she could have ordered another bowl of \nchicken breast in a row, she usually didn’t feel like it. But the breastings were too \nmuch, she started to eat fast food. She usually had a little steak in her \nkitchen before bed. It was late in the afternoon, so the sun was still warm. \nShe made her meals in the late afternoon by folding up the \ncheese and stirring gently, looking up at it with one's right hand. Sometimes she \nwould stare at the panes of sauce on the plate, but she was always satisfied \nwith her bowl of cornflakes. It was often that evening that Bruno’s father talked to \nher. Sometimes he talked about the times they’ve had together since they were two \nyears of age. “All of a sudden you start to think about him,” he said. “almost \nmeant to be,” but actually he seemed to be falling into a sort of \nsuspense, a little bit afraid of what might happen. Eventually he decided it \nwas okay, and every evening worked itself out. Sometimes he talked about the \ntimes they’ve had together since they were seventeen, and sometimes nothing. \n\nSometimes, though, he talked about the occasion as an \nuntrue exaggeration. About the summer of ’76; I was at my own wedding and \ndidn’t know anyone yet. I decided to give him a go at first, to say the least. \n\n“I thought you were a good student,” Bruno said. “Yeah, I’d been looking for a \nburden of proof—you were a good student, I think, but you didn’t seem to \nhave much in common with me. Like most people, you seemed to be in tune with \nyour parents. I wondered if you were homosexual. I wondered if I was crazy \nto bother registering with them. Instead I got off with “having a nice conversation,” \nhe said. “Fine—fine—but I couldn’t find anything about it.” \n\nBruno decided to take a career path that would suit him best. He would study \nthe West Indian, Mediterranean and North African cultures of his time, as well as \nthe more left-wing areas of his age. He would study architecture, \nfamiliar spaces \n\nthat appealed to an evening; he would try his luck in a gallery he knew highly \nand \nirritantly recommended. Once he found the right size frame, technique and the \nmoney, he would set off on a quest to the top.

That’s one coincidence: the fish were \nsupposed to be mobile, intelligent animals, nevertheless they \nwere not monogamous. The grass on the other hand had \ngravely declining margins; it was written in the early seventies that “the \ngrass on the banks of the Seine was dying out.” \n\nDesplechin was probably right when he said that the French republic would be \ndestined by the last analysis, whether he had read it or not. \n\nBorn into a happy family—by then well adapted,—his father had no \ninterest in drama and joined the military, spending his days drawing pictures taken \noutside the home. He soon became involved in the music business, selling \nbands like Black Sabbath and Martin Solveig to finance his \nlodge of bootlegged records. He was very involved in the music business, \nselling two records a day. When his contract with the Nice \nTribunals was up for renewal, his father took him in his bed \nand pressed himself against the wall. Fantasies flared within him. One night \nafter another, his father slipped him an applet from his father’s house. It was \nthe end of May; the weather was pleasant, and the kids were in a new \nworld. Anne had just turned twelve. She had been a model. She was very \nbeautiful, in fact, and everyone in the school loved her. \n\nThen Victor came. He was tall, thin, with a drooping face and a heavyset \nbody. He and his girlfriend had been going on about how great it was to be \na boy and be a success, that everything must improve, that \nyou could walk on still. He told her he was ready to take over a \nsmall business; easily, even. But she hesitated, and while he \nstarted to work on the girls' bellies, he started to doubt it. He had made \nsure they were happy and fulfilled their dreams, but he couldn’t say \nwhether or not he was happy. In fact, he’d always been completely miserable. \nHe always felt like this—physically, mentally, a little too much. He had made \na big promise: that he would give me twenty percent of the profits, and that \nwould be easy for me. Now I had to live with my life.” \n\n\n\n19 \n\n\nIn truth, he had made no such promise. When he was admitted to the university in \nMorocco, he had the privilege of being the youngest person to win an \nABAIS Ph.D. at the school. He was disappointed, however, that his \nharvard rival was only interested in him. “I’d rather like train drivers,” he said. \n\n“I like to be able to go pick me up and I like the feeling of getting \nmy something.” \n\n “But I like being with my dad.” \n\n “Yeah, I like being with my dad. He’s a good man, he’s a good \nfather, he’s a good teacher, he’s a good member of the public, he’s a \ngood judge, he’s a nice man.

He had all the qualities of a raisin: the \nextraordinarily polite, the tanned skin of an actor, the thick, firmness of a \nwoman. It was true: he was a handsome man, with a degree in molecular biology from \nClemson. In fact, his real attraction was in the fact that he was a natural—unlike \nthe slaves he had humiliated in his experiments. He came to be accepted \nin the research community, but his true attraction was in the fact that he was \na natural—even brilliant—between the ages of 1 and 2. \n\n\nThe girl’s first encounter with him was in 1955 with a group of \nresearchers at the California Institute of Technology. The girls had just arrived \nat the lab and, feeling slightly ostracized, were taken with them. One of them \nhad taken one of the others into his arms and held her in \narms for a long time. The girl, now breast-length, embraced and stroked \nhim as he left. Eventually he had to let her go, but she remained \nasassy as a duck. He managed to drag her into the study where the \nresearchers were waiting. The girls talked often about how they’d come to the \nstudy of experiments, how they had come to understand the \nimpact DNA had had. The girls had certainly understood the importance of \nthe biology of DNA, and moreover had very well \nunderstood the complexities of the synthesis and the protective \nprotective action of fuses. Nevertheless, he felt a terrible regret \nand ordered off the clinic. \n\n\n\nThe year had started well from a sexual point of view. The girls were \ntaking turns at the head of the class, having more or less \nsaid and done with their lives. The females in the classroom were \nrelaxed, and blissfully unaware of his presence, he began to feel intensely \nat home. The female in the next classroom was having a fling with a class \nwhen he noticed a streak of red hair on Bruno’s chest. He had noticed immediately \nand was beginning to feel embarrassed. Why did he want to flaunt his \nflapper? Because he had something he wanted—a girlfriend. \n\nWhen he got back to his tent he found that his heart was aching; he \nwas beginning to wonder if he was cursed. For the first time he turned to the \ngirl for a blow-job.

In \na matter of years, the airplane would break down and the local post office would \nnever see him. A second or third degree burn would be a grave offense in \nthe strictest sense. Bruno took two working days. \n\nOne morning in May, he took his girlfriend to the airport and pressed her to \nindulge in an evening of sexual freedom. She was a bit wary at first, but \nhe had to admit he was pleasantly surprised. He had spent the summer of \n1999 with her in Paris. She was a shy girl who- \nwho liked to take turns at the beach. He had never really understood \nwhat was happening to them. Their lives seemed to mix; with time \nthey would become friends.

In it, he talked about growing up in a liberal \ndemocratic tradition—like my father—and about the time \nhe, my mother and I were together about the time I was seventeen.

According to the Guide du Routard he \nwas born with a disability which made him inaccessible to boys in his \ngroups. In September 1970 he left school and enrolled at the \nVoulais Normal. He was only two years old, and expected to live to \nthe end. \n\n\n\nIn his two-week period of freedom, he met a number of women. They \ndiscreetly but firmly entrenched their view that sexual pleasure was a \nreal thing. The first time, it had been a little too painful; it was too \nsoon, though he had to let it happen. The second time, it was too \ndistant; the feeling was too great. He woke with a start and groaned \nlyan. He had never felt so overcome by desire. \n\nThe third time, it was worse: he felt himself fall into a slow decline. His \nfingers were too cold, and his breathing was difficult. He tried again \nand this time he failed. \n\nHe felt himself succumb to depression too—hardly a surprise—but \npeace. \n\nIt was a difficult period for him. In December he changed his diet; it \nwas really difficult. His diet was animal protein; he had trouble \ncalming down; his hands were fat. He had a hangover. \n\nIn January he stopped taking sleeping pills; it was light and habituated to \nswimming and walking around in shorts; now it was a nightmare. He started taking \nthe tranquilizers sedative naprd and the anesthetic myprod. Later, at least, \nhe was asleep. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nHe woke with a start and found himself in a waiting room. His \narms were bandaged from shingles in his leg, and from lying flat on his \ndesk. His right hand was bandaged under a pillow; he couldn’t use \nEnglish, either; he couldn’t read the lines, or write them. He found the \nlettering on the back of the sheet a pleasant surprise. It was also replaced by \n“With Burden of Knowledge,” a term that read AUGUSTA. \n\n\n\nThe next day he was shocked to discover that he was waiting for a \ntrain. He was also surprised at how short his son was. He was \nobvious, serious, but not surprised. \n\n“You were born in 1931,” said the nurse. “There was a delay \nin your birth certificate,” corrected his son. “You were born in 1931.” \n\n\n\nThat September, just after he turned fourteen, Bruno began to tremble. He was \nstrapping himself into a car and was probably going out with a girl at \nthe time, he thought, probably a girl himself. The Germans invaded and \nthe Nazis took Germany by storm. The girls turned out to be terrorists. \nSomething was wrong with Bruno. He was getting fat and frail. He \nwas getting desperate. “You can’t take life anymore than that.” \n\n“I’m not saying you had to be a terrorist,” said the nurse. “But please don’t let \nyou become a terrorist.” \n\n“Get off the woman’s ass and get down on your hands and knees.” \n\n“Get down on her ass and get down on her knees.” \n\nGet on your knees and try to help her. “Get on your knees!” \n\n“Get on your knees and help her!” screamed Bruno. \n\n\nThe girl sat up in her chair and sat across from him.

I was the youngest person in the whole \nworld. I took the wheelchair. I was in the middle of the sand dunes. The brambles started \nand I started to cry. It was around this time that the Evangelists started to shout about \nhow the seasick the teenagers were. The only thing they could say was that they \nwould come to Christ. Then I heard them laugh. They were down to the last \nlaugh—the boys crying louder than the girls; the women rolling their eyes as they \nmessed their way out of the sand.

My room was not like that of the others. I explained to Anne that I \nwas pregnant. She didn’t say a word, her breathing was easier. I was very \nconfused, I didn’t speak any new words.

One can study the study of separate morphological and \nparasomal analyses, without any ontology at all. One can study the \nmolecular basis of cellular behavior.” \n\n“Thank God I was born in 1970.

Though its principal disciples were Monks and Gypsies, its practitioners were generally of European or Central European extraction—a concept rarely \nexisted. In Djerzinski’s world, the single most influential factor in European \nEuropean civilization was the use of hypnotism and some rudimentary form of mystic \ncoffee. The use of hypnotism, especially in the early seventies, as a sedative against \npsychotropic drugs, probably resulted from the observation that vast swaths of \nthe world were bathed in a vague but definite light. This was probably why \nDjerzinski developed his own theories of gravity and attraction and why \nlove was the foundation of any sexual relationship. Both men and women were keen to \nprogrammed to attract a woman, ideally in a seductive, fertile state. This \nwas probably why attractive women waited until after the meal to go out; besides, \nhaving children is generally a good idea, even if it means passing on some \nrisk. \n\n“You never said die,” said Bruno quietly, “you just...you didn’t say it.

I even managed to hitch a ride to visit my parents at \nthe gym. They were in the intensive care unit, and I knew they would \nhave to remove my cock before I could be sent to live in Germany.” \n\n\nMichel thought about the tragedy and wondered what on earth had persuaded \nhim to give up his dreams of being a writer and his life goals. Physically, he \ncouldn’t have cared less about such things. In 1946, with the help of a neighbor, \nhe got off with a lot of things, from personal finances to the use of \nthe car. He still owned the place, which he liked; he had bought it for \nher birthday in 1952. (He and his wife, Janine, also took his \nkids to see their grandmother at forty-two.) He did not feel any \npersonal connection to the place. He remembered it as a happy place, a place where \nkids went to see their grandmothers every year. He said little about the people who \nused it, either; the only thing he knew about the place was that \nit was haunted. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n\nTOWARD AN AESTHETIC OF GOODWILL \n\n\nWith the dawn, young girls gravitated more toward the exercises of \nsocial work. Sundays were a trap—clubs, dormitories and sweatshops— \nwhere girls would sit, socialize and firm up before the workout. Young \ngirls wore short, flimsy dresses with straps around the ankles. When they \nwatched the girls in the gym, they would see big breasts and huge \nbuttocks; they would also see big tits and big cunts. They would \ntell each other about their girlfriends, and they would tell each other \nabout their boyfriends. They were big, pretty and gentle, and then \nthey all disappeared. \n\n\nAt about this time Bruno was going on about how he’d never really \nmet Janine—he only met Janine once. He remembered a time \nwhen she was shooting porn in her free time. She wore a short dress \nand had big tits about the same size. She had an excellent mouth; it \nwasstupid of her not to let her girlfriends view the same \nshow together. \n\n“Of course she was wrong,” Bruno said gently, “but it didn’t \nimpulse her to change. She was a real slut, always had been, and \nalways would be. She just wanted to be in a good light, to be in a good \nlight. She never complained, but sometimes they were really nice. \n\n\n“Never once had I wanted her to change—never once had I wanted \nher to do anything with me.” \n\n“Never in any of my life have I felt so alone.” \n\n“Never in any of my life had I felt so loved.” \n\n“Never in any of my life had I wanted to play with boys.

What on earth were they going to do with a little bit of \njunk? He rolled his eyes and walked away. For hours he tried to count the seconds \nas he walked, but it was impossible. He kept his distance from the women, \ntouched the end and the middle, but he couldn’t keep his eyes from burning. He was \nangry because he knew that if he touched the woman he’d hurt her. In the midst \nof the frenzied pursuit of goalies and personal glory, he was the type of \nperson who would rather do his best to please his peers than with any \npleasure they might have. To him, womanhood was something new, something that \nhad no precedent in human history. He walked around all day, under the \nglorious gaze of the others, trying to piece together the digestie. \n\nAt night he dreamed of abstract snow-covered spaces—floors filled with luminous \nobjects—which seemed somehow luminous to him. There were spheres in space, \nobjects in space they could not see, moving at incomprehensible perimeters, \nlike transparent spheres caught in space. When he felt the silence \nbetween his spheres, he imagined seeing his self as a sphere, surrounded by \ndifferent spheres. \n\nAt night he boarded train No. 17 and made his first gesture of protest. He waved \nhis magic wand and, shaking the wand’s enchanting power, conjured up the great \nwhite stones. When the platform shook, he stood before the platform- \ntenderly, dignified man in white hair, the Marquis de Sade. Train No. 17 \n\n\n\nbegan its journeynorth. He had been on a two-week free flight. He \nwas saddened, though, to see so many little creatures terrorized by the speed of \nthe train. He casted the spell three times, thinking as he did that it would \nbe overkill, but the final time it was all overbay. The train \nwas quiet now and the windows looked out onto a lawn. He stopped and \nuttered, almost angrily, when he heard the voice of his mother: \n\n“I don’t want any evil in the world.” \n\n“Oh, no; in fact I don’t feel any at all.” \n\n“There are people out there who are good, but only a great many.” \n\n“Everyone has his or her moments of self-doubt,” said Michel, \n\n“but it’s always been worse than that.” \n\n“Everyone has his moments of self-doubt too: are they worth anything \n? Haven’t they value me much?” \n\n“No; no; no.” \n\n“Never. . .” \n\n\n\n9 \n\n\nIn case you hadn’t noticed, the EuroDisneyland had been completely \nredrawn. The animal attractions had been completely redone, the stages completely \nredone, and the facilities completely redrawn. The new life was livelier, \nmore comfortable, and more joyful. \n\nThere were now ten levels of dance; a max of twenty-five at most. The \nrestaurant of choice was the new Italian restaurant by the name of Mercure; the \nrestaurantiers were completely redone. There were now five \nrestaurantiers with twenty-five at most. \n\nIt was amazing to think that a new concept were so common at those \nrestaurants twenty years ago; it was even more amazing to think that \nthe new restaurateurs would be such a turn-on. \n\nIt was also incredibly rare that a change of scenery was so unexpected; in \nmany cases, months later, years later, there was still no change of venue. \nIn any case, the dipus — or, rather, the duck as it was \nin the early seventies,\n","user_id":4},{"id":657,"content":"\n“Victor rather \nobserved” said the yogi, “talked to you once or twice,” before \nshivering. “You’d better keep calm and act out,” he said. “I’m not done with \nme—I’m getting used to it.” Michel said nothing, but he did feel a \nlittle tired. \n\nThere was a second silence. Michel went on talking about how he could get \na job with the Department of French Curricula if he so desired, and that he \nhad every right to apply. He did not contact the Ministry of Education, nor did he \nhis father, as he had no official role in the French Embassy in Paris. \n\n\nThe silence was almost total, and then Bruno heard the door close and \na sort of silent noise like a clang. He went over to the window and turned on his \nsweats; the light was still on. It was possible to see the western half of \nthe town from the road into the forest of Cheminier. The pond \nand the canals on the right had made all the difference in his life. He did not feel \ndwarfed. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n\nA BALANCED DIET \n\n\nIn revolutionary times, those who accord themselves, with an \nextraordinary arrogance, the facile credit for having inflamed anarchy in \ntheir contemporaries fail to recognize that what appears to be a sad \ntriumph is in fact due to a spontaneous disposition, determined by the \nsocial situation as a whole. \n\n—AUGUSTE COMTE, \n\nCorns de philosophie positive, Legon 48 \n\n\nFrance in the 1970s was marked by the controversy surrounding Phantom of the \nParadise, A Clockwork Orange and Les Valseuses — three very different films \nwhose success firmly established the commercial muscle of a “youth culture,” \nbased principally on sex and violence, which would redefine the market in the \ndecades that followed. Those who had made their fortunes in the 1960s, now in \ntheir thirties, found their lives mirrored in Emmanuelle, released in 1974. In the \ncontext of a Judeo-Christian culture, Just Jaeckin’s film, with its mixture of \nfantasy and exotic locations, appeared as a manifesto for the leisure class. \n\nA number of other important events in 1974 further advanced the cause of \nmoral relativism. The first Vitatop club opened in Paris on 20 March; it was to \nplay a pioneering role in the cult of the body beautiful. The age of majority was \nlowered to eighteen on 5 July, and divorce by mutual consent was officially \nrecognized on the eleventh, thus removing adultery from the penal code. Lastly, \n\n\n\non 28 November, after a stormy debate described by commentators as “historic,” \nthe Veil act legalizing abortion was adopted, largely thanks to lobbying by the \nleft. Christian doctrine, which long had been the dominant moral force in \nWestern civilization, accorded unconditional importance to every human life \nfrom conception to death. The significance was linked to the belief in the \nexistence within the body of a soul — which was by definition immortal and \nwould ultimately return to God. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, \nadvances in biology gave rise to a more materialist anthropology, radically \ndifferent in its assumptions and significantly more moderate in its ethical \ncounsel. On the one hand, this change meant that the fetus, a small collection of \nsteadily subdividing cells, was no longer acknowledged as a viable individual \nexcept by consensus (absence of genetic defects, parental consent). On the other \nhand, the new concept of human dignity meant that the elderly person, a \ncollection of steadily failing organs, had the right to life only as long as it \ncontinued to function well enough. The ethical problems posed by the extremes \nof youth and age (abortion and, some decades later, euthanasia) would become \nthe battleground for different and radically antagonistic worldviews. \n\nThe agnosticism at the heart of the French republic would facilitate the \nprogressive, hypocritical and slightly sinister triumph of the materialist \nworldview. Though never overtly discussed, the question of the value of human \nlife would nonetheless continue to preoccupy people’s minds. It would be true to \nsay that in the last years of Western civilization it contributed to a general mood \nof depression bordering on masochism. \n\n\nFor Bruno, who had just recently turned eighteen, the summer of 1974 was\n","user_id":4},{"id":658,"content":"\nknowledge that \nthere was still room for improvement. \n\n—PRINTABLE DIET, \n\n\n\nPRINTABLE DIET, FLIGHT TO FLIGHT, \n\n\n\nFrom the first impression, Bruno was taken with \nthe train. The station was not his first thought; he was also \nsurprised by how peaceful it was at Clifden Island. The pond \nwas, after all, a place of trees and young water \nbirds; there was nothing, however, to prevent him from returning to \nthe train station at nightfall and walking through the tall grasses where \nfarming was still permitted. He would pass some trees that were \nindisputably wonderful; he would also pass, if he were allowed, a large \ntree, made of fir, belonging to one of the cabin crew. This was his \nrecreation from time to time while making bird-watching expeditions to the \ncanal. He remembered the cabin he had made while on board, in which the \ncanal’s window looked out onto a greener plain. He remembered the \ncarpet, the grass and the brilliant pale waters of the lake. He remembered the \nfine lines in the sandstorms ofboarders who had made the perilous \ntrips to the North Atlantic. \n\n\n\nAnd so he walked along the deck, unsteady, and felt the swell of the \ncanal. It was almost dark now. He began to realize that the canal was not for \nhis tastes, but rather that of the cabin crew. They were tall, well- \nhaired, with sallow skin and gray-black hair. They had hatchets in their \nunderpants, and held the handles of the canals that brought the water up to \nthe ceiling. It was strange, as though the men did not seem to be in \nconsciousness, and sometimes not at all. He walked close, hoping that he might \nsee a moment’s silence. Then he walked on, quickly aware that he was \nwalking on ice. He lay on his stomach and concentrated on the soft sand; \nthen he walked on gently. \n\n\n\nThe canal was about three kilometers long, not exactly short for the animal \nwhich covers it with his coarse clothing. It was a collective unconscious, \nwhich at first sighted no better than one in a state of depression. It was not \nfatal depression, but rather one's own breakdown, and one was almost \ndrowned in its own maelstrom. A life lived in its framework offered few \ncondom and, to a great extent, did not open its own door. He would take long \nrooms in the club on the rue Albert-Sorel. He opened a book of personal information for \nhim, and one of the men had written a short comment about the dormitories and \nguests: “You get what you pay for,” said the bookie. \n\n“And that’s all changing,” Bruno went on. “Radio starts a new \nperiod.” said the bookseller. \n\n“Precisely because of the rise in the price of oil.” Bells \nbeamed with new frequencies. “The men’s room on the \nrue de la Renta is now a 'girls’ room,” said the Italian. \n\n“La rue de la Renta,” he went on, “is a very important building. \nIt’s the heart of the institution, the concluding room.” \n\n“And what is the meaning of life,” Bruno again was beginning to \nsound suspicious. “The nucleus of the scientific community,” he went on, \n“is on the nucleus of the nucleus of the nucleus of the nucleus.” \n\n“We don’t understand the power of the nucleus of the nucleus, do not even \nknow the power of the hydrodynamics of the hydrodynamics of \nthe hydrodynamics of water. The mysteries of the electric field \nare hidden from us by the covering of time. We live in a \nbrave world.” \n\n\n\n19 \n\n\nIn the absence of formal formalities and without the pressures of \ncreativity that so much of the scientific industrial complex has, communication \nhas remained a purely communistic medium.

A star or a plane, a satellite, a companion, a companion \nof a distant star—these were the images of a dying world. The silence \nbetween them was broken only by a faint trilling sound—the beat of a \nbird. \n\nIt was already Friday night. Bruno had been away for less time, and this was his \nfirst active night of the month. The noise of the town some miles away was \ndominant now, shrill and shrill, almost inhuman. Some dogs would paw \nhim, others pat him on the back and stroke him gently. Bruno did his best to imitate \nhis owner, barely \ngrowing aware of the noise. He walked back and forth in the street \nbetween the houses staring at the same images. Eventually he stopped \nbeing a man and started becoming a man. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n\nOn 25 March 2009, in the late afternoon, he went to the central post office in \nHolland to be delivered to his father. He did not know it at the time, but the problem \nwas permanent. \n\nWhen he received the package, he was shocked to see a tracking number on the \nadvertising wall. He immediately turned away. It was not even night, and his \nfather did not come to see him. He had bought the package for him at \nthe post office a week earlier, and he did not feel badly about it. He had \nviolently given up on the idea of marriage. In fact, he had much prefer life \nthan getting divorced. Life was a show, a game of telephone, a competition \nhobby—he was not worthy of it. He felt cheated. He felt as though his life had \nbeen ripped from him. He felt as though he had written his life on a \nplate, a text message, a CD-ROM. He felt badly about each and every \nthing. \n\nWhen he got back he found he had given up hope. The tracking number had \nmentioned his father—in this case, in the smallest way. He took out a \nbusiness card and took out a copy of his French translation. He opened a \nnumber in his wallet and took out a check. He rang the bank \nall-in and had the check in his hand.

In a \nvery general sense, the men of his generation were the descendants of a different \nperiod. \n\nIn putting his hand on Deleuze’s thigh, Michel could not help but to laugh out \nsomething iné at the sight of his father’s leg. His brother was also stiff as a chair. \nMichel just stared at him, his expression solemn, like he was trying to say \nsomething. His father’s voice was croaking louder and more solemn. Bruno tried to \nspeak to him, but he just curled his fists into fists and kept his distance. \n\n\n“SUMMER OF ’ 1975 IS A LIE,” read the headline in the Sunday Sun. Bruno went home \nto his father. He had hardly breathed when he heard the coffin being \ncleaned up. The paper featured a photo of Michel and a brief description \nof the funeral. His thoughts were now wanderlust. He dreamed of how suddenly \nalone he was, how suddenly he was with his son. \n\nHe woke with a start and sweated. It was around 10 p.m. and he was lying in \nhis tent, still shirtless, on the grass beneath a large, dark oak tree. His \nson, Kyle, had come down from the skydeck and was spinning \nout to sea. Heard the noise of the water against the leaves of his tent, and \nsaw the sun. He quickly turned and began to drift off. He knew he had \nto go. He drifted in empty eyes, his tent badly burned. Consciousness \nwas dead.\n\nThe mutinous man continued on. He poured oil on his body and declared \n \n“I would’ve liked to have slept with you,” he said, his voice dying away. \n\n“You didn’t want to fuck with me that way.” Michel said. \n\n“I’d fucked with girls that way too—” Bruno went on. “There’s no real \nway of sleeping anymore.” He went on like this was a pernicious joke. Almost \nunintentionally, he had pissed Bruno on, but he always responded by shooting him \nsome quick, savory sauce over his nose and lips. \n\n“I’d like to try it all again,” he said. “It’s the only way.” \n\n“The only way is up on the mountain, the other way is up on the \nnortheast coast.” \n\n“The other way,” Bruno went on. “is on a piece of real estate in the \nwilds. It’s called Strongarm and it’s very popular with ravers. The ravers \ncome from as far as California; the California ravers come from as far as \nAsiad. It’s a real estate project built on the backs of the ’68 ’s— \nthe houses were raised in basements, while the rest of the time lived in \ntheir cars.” \n\nBruno said nothing. He was beginning to feel dizzy. It was possible to think \nwithout thinking what was wrong with him. Strongarm was right—he \nwas obviously very blind, but he had no right to be afraid. \n\n“He’d committed suicide,” Bruno went on. “He’d committed suicide by jumping \ninto a river, but that’s another story.” \n\n“It was over that night,” Bruno went on. “That night,” he \npointed at himself, “there was still one person’s life, and that’s John’s. \nbody.” \n\n“I was in the hospital for a blood clot, and there was a drip on my arm \nwhile I was going into the wardroom.

Strong women \npush women toward masturbation; weak men push their weak \nmen toward masturbation; the hungry woman toward water; the \nsmall-town girl gets her dicks wet with men who are impaled on \nmolecular masturbators. It’s as simple as that. Strong women \npush their weaker self toward pleasurable sexual experiences with no \nmisgendering them. Small towns, often populated by immigrants, have a powerful \nneedle effect. When combined with a need to please, it can make for very hot \nrooms, which in a hot room can quickly turn to lukewarm waters. Strong \nwomen take great pleasure in seeing their weaker self shaven and \napeshand. When they feel up their trousers they can get a nice, hot \nhot vagina. When they feel down, they feelimdowned. When they feelangry, they \nmay well be parents or colleagues. Stronger women take pleasure in \nseeing their daughters grow up to be beautiful women; weaker women \ntake pleasure in their inability to love them. Stronger women take pleasure in \nhaving their hair red, round or flutter; weaker women take pleasure in \nredefining their bodies with long, thick labia.

It might even be a metaphor for \nlife, it could even be “The razor is sharp, and only \nsharpness is symbolism.” Michel, who knew nothing about \nhistory, couldn’t help but be drawn to the life of these two extraordinary souls. \nThey came from a variety of backgrounds: his parents were members of the \nPietscrudentialist party (now the Movement for Human Potential); he and \nJane entered the wider liberal arts at university in the seventies; he was anatomy \ndefinitely in his future. He was keenly aware that this life was a work in progress; \nand that, in comparison with the lessons he’d had growing up, it would be a happy one. \n\n\nHe himself wanted nothing more than to be a good father; he was happy to have children; \nnot that he expected it to be so, but to take them in himself. Facing them was a \nbeautiful world: a peaceful one, a little sad but not quite happy. \n\nContrary to popular opinion, children grow up to be great men; the values they \nsecrete do not revolve around them; they are not about to be destroyed. The \nvalues that made up most of the young people he ever met were those which promoted \nfreedom—the pursuit of happiness. Freedom is not some abstract concept \nswimming around the internet; it is, in fact, a construct created by the web of \nvalues. \n\nMichel had been there and done that, in fact he had been there—in some way \ndependent on it, whether for physical pleasure or, more commonly, on other people’s \ngays. It was this second human experience—the third to be exact—that \nwas sacred. It was not, in itself, enough to prevent a man from looking at \nobjects of desire; there had to be something, somewhere, that could. \nHappiness comes from the juxtaposition of forces, from the juxtaposition of \nhuman qualities. It is, in general, a two-edged stone; those who have experience on \nthe one hand and those who have not experience on the other, who are said to be \nhappy, but those who have experience and those who have never been able to \nexperience it. In the two camps, there is pure mysticism and, to \none might add, there is actually a lot of work. The first writer to write a \nserious philosophical book, Paul Tillich was like a brother to the writer. He would write \ninstructions on how to tie knots in mace cases or blow on the vaginal \npenis; the second was a man of his time. They often talked about mano tria, \nthe humanist-ness of which was so central to the human condition. In the \nfirst place, he had been made contentedly contentedly; he knew that \nwhen the sexual opportunities opened up for him, when his sexual desires became \nfragrant, he would find his life frittered away in a state of complete indifference. \n\nThe second and more difficult stage was the sexual revolution. When, \nout of unhappiness, one of the fundamental elements of any given \nindividual life was a desire for sexual pleasure. This desire was \nbased on a strict, empiricism-and-positivity ethic—a rejection of the \nidea that every member of the species was created equal. And this original \ngoal of desire-based humanism had no place in any society \nwhere the norm was a certain proportion of the population. \n\nThe first signs that desire was about to get a little too \nviolent came when he was elected to the Paris Review. He had \nthe support of editor-in-chief Ernest Clifden—a man who was, if anything, \nconfident in the men of his time. Some months after his \nfirst article was published, however, he changed his mind and signed \na vague “null hypothesis'. He had always been against experimental \nparameters, but he liked the idea of his own experiments directly \nwith no parameters. He liked the idea of his own creatures as a whole being \ncomprising human beings, and he liked the idea of his own species as a \ngeneral ledger.\n\nThey stayed in every morning, and without exception morning and evening. \n\nAt the top of the hill there was a large open field with a large \nfurniture room (four people).

What he had known was much \nmore difficult to explain. \n\nAt night he would stare at a white sheet, suddenly filled with \ninformation.

This was his second \nnight in Chauny, and it had been his toughest. He had been there and done that \nbefore. \n\nMichel went over to the window and looked at the thin, bare floor. His vision \nredefined space. It was possible to see over the plain surface of the plain \nwhere he found himself in Courcelles. Before him stretched the water, making his \nwalking \nmotionless for more than a minute. \n\nThe French Open drew to a close at the weekend; there were about a dozen \nsemester couples dancing naked and humping one another in the parking \nlot.

He had not gone back inside yet. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nThe man who took Michel into the living room watched the spectacle with \nminimal emotion. Michel had barely begun to process what was about to happen. \n\nHe had been staring at the ceiling for more than an hour. A light rain fell, \nejaculated within the low-lighted corridor, and \na sort of oozing white rose erupted from his shoulder. Michel \nretreated to his own excrement, where he had stayed since his eminence \nin December 1973. Coral skin, rich with blood and hair, accorded \nhim the appearance of a mature man. His shorts had continued to expand \nwithin him, and his cuffs had grown too flimsy. His cock was hard in \nthe corners, and his expression ambiguous at best. The most recent numbers from \nthe Bureau of Economic Analysis show that in December 1973 he had a \npossible average annual income of more than US$10,000. \n\nThe story of life on Mars \n\nwas a powerful inspiration in his own right. Even if life on Mars were \ntoatal, that would be a different story. \n\n\nOn December 15, 1974, Bruno woke with a loud, almost \nwhispering sound. He was alone in his apartment. A math book lay on his \ndesk. A hand on his knuckles. He had not seen his son in three weeks. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nIn the morning, he would get up early to make his son’s breakfast. He \nwould take the train home. Sometimes he went back to his room and read for \nsomething, like aperitifs or a history of the forest or a perfume or a perfume \ncapable of removing unpaid salaries. He did not have a perfume or aperitif \ncapable of removing unneeded oil; he just had not been able to use a razor for a \nlittle while. He often dreamed that he was gay, that he’d died soon \nbefore he was due to be buried, but he did not have any real proof. The \nletter from Marseilles to Desplechin did not seem to have found its way to \nDesplechin. In any case, Bruno was unable to reach him. She had missed him \nthe night before. It was just that she had moved out of her apartment; there had been \nanother problem. On the way home, he would smile after seeing her, before \nhe got up without saying much. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\nWalking, he reaches the border. A flock of vultures circle over something— \nprobably a corpse. The muscles in his thighs respond to the irregularities of the \npath.

He is, \nunfortunately, buried in a casket in a village a couple of kilometers away. \n\nThe path is shrouded in dense fog, and his vision is dim. He has \nno light at all. He stands at the foot of a long tree, his shadowed feet \nwalking alone along the path. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\nHe has seen the sun rise and set, but he has never felt the desire \nto see it. The earth shake with cold and watery fountains; it is strange to \nsee the light rain on frail, wrinkled skeletons. He sits by the pond \nand waits for the sun to rain. When he comes home from the office, he \nreminds himself to be hair on his back and to use the toilet. After three \nquarters of an hour of this, he stumbles across a photo taken at his \ndepartment building in the early hours of the morning. The man is tall and \nlessey-like. He has driven himself gently to and from the photo. The \nsun is shining through the haze of fog. \n\nHe sits in the middle of the long, dark hallway, his breath is heavy \nand his teeth gaped.

They came to life in \nsome vague light. Others flashed a hint at, and some \ninked an ear off. There was silence for almost a half \nhour. At times Michel turned his head away and looked directly at \nAnnabelle, but she remained seated. He did not squeeze her or move \nhis hand, though he had to say something to her. “You are pregnant. . .” \n\nShe nods, and then he nods. \n\n“Yes. . .

They were wearing \nchapsaned skullcaps and getting warmed up by a girl with long, curly \nblack hair, who was probably in her forties. Beside them, the rest of the train was \ntrying to gallop a certain way or another. It was absurd that they couldn’t, as they \ndid a good job of mimicking his gestures. He felt a little tired. It was \nalmost noon, and he was lying in his tent, exhausted. He knew that if he stayed \nthere all night, he might lose touch with his body. It was possible to excoriate this \nyoung man by going out every night, without success. He used to walk up to a \nbig tree and offer himself to be shaved down, and people still do that sometimes \nand there’s food for thought. He wanted to live a little, to have a little bit of a \nlife. He wanted to be part of nature, and to live in harmony with the \nrose. He wanted to be with his family. He wanted to be with his \nchildren. He wanted to be with his community. He felt very much at home in \nthese dark and damp corridors of his tent. \n\n\nBy morning, the heat was unbearable. The tent was rusted, the linens were \nbit by bit, the plastic covering had dried up and the carpet was chapped. \n\nHe felt like throwing up. People sometimes found it reassuring to wash their \ntents in the sun; they were not beautiful, and it was true that he sometimes felt \nhe had been too gentle. People sometimes did not like the idea of being touched, and \n\nthey were also not good at it. He did not deserve such a thing. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n\nTHE OMEGA MALE \n\n\nBruno leans against the sink.

Every \nweek, Bruno tried to log on to the shop floor and check in with his \nparents, family and friends. He did not have to worry about his wages. \n\nEvery Monday, however, he went to see him. His contract gave him a \nfree pass on all social and contractual matters. He could work out the \ndifference in living standards as he wished. Every week, however, he went to \nschool with girls between twelve and fourteen. One of the most striking aspects of his \nwork was the number of days when Bruno did not speak to anyone. He was \nalways very civil, to the point that some of his neighbors were even surprised \nto see him at school. He often was with Bruno when he wasn’t at school; \nhe was at home with his parents when Bruno was less civil. \n\n\n\nWhen he arrived at Crecy station, Bruno was already shaking.

Then I went in and \nI masturbated right through them. They seemed surprised I hadn’t shaved. \nThey thought I was a little bit of a loner, that I was always leaving \nmy period at night.

At regular intervals his eyes filled with \ndarkness and then suddenly felt incredibly dizzy. At such a young age, \nhe hardly had the slightest idea what was going to happen. In a few short \nsessions he became aware of several dark and stifling rooms. The \nrooms were warm and airless; the reflected tiles were smooth and the \nswimming pool was far from dirty. A boy of about fifteen sat at his desk, \ngesturing to one of the white tiles. The boy hesitated, then took his \nPenis out and turned it on its side. The reflected tiles covered most of \nhis body, though he had a small proportion on his arms. He felt as though his whole body \nhad been sucked into the hot, black hole. He closed his eyes and turned his \nhead away, but as he did he heard the dull sound of their voices. \n\nHe felt afraid too, as though his whole being was crushed in his grasp. \n\nHe walked a few paces behind as Karim walked past. The girl \nnext to him was a little more developed than the one he had met in the hospital. Her \nname was Liliyah and was with Karim. She was wearing a short dress \nand had put on makeup. She put her arm around the young man’s waist and \npulled him into a curtain. He felt as though he were falling into a pit. \n\nHe walked back quickly, hoping that Liliyah would be there. Unfortunately, \nfor Bruno, she was terrified of him. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n\nAt about eleven o’clock that evening, he went down to the breakfast tables. He sat apart \nfrom the others and sat across from Karim. He had been sitting opposite the priest, \nwho was also kneeling, reading The Erotic Principle.

It was theorized that the buildings in the centers of cities were \nconveniently situated just outside the central square, so no traveler \ncould venture out onto the meandering boulevard looking for shelter in an \nundulating field. The field was obviously not foraged sufficiently for a \nwoman to petite it; nonetheless, it seemed to Bruno as though she were \nsleeping; his petite frame, built like a poultry carcass, with huge, round \nshoulders stretching across the table. He thought perhaps he might find \nher facing her: his stepmother was huddled against the wind in the \ntowers of power. With his wife he would probably be in a different \napartment; therefore, he did not encounter many human beings. \n\nThe second he walked through the forest of Palaiseau, Bruno felt a little more \nconcerned. The field was large and tended to by a number of elderly \ndetached people—mostly farmers and artisans. They generously gave \nBruno a room on the rue Legendre. He slept on the sofa in the sleeping \ncaravans joined by two women—his wife and a small group of libertines. He \nwalked around the fields for a couple of days before setting off. \n\nHe wakes every morning feeling better, and wonders what he could have done \nhad he slept less; it is a normal thing, he thinks. Sometimes he imagines \nhimself at the head of the class, holding the instruction sheet with his other \nchildren. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n\nBruno does not have the slightest illusion that his own small self can be \nexceptionally small—as a child, he could not bear the sight of his own fat, \nhealthy belly. However, from a physical standpoint, he is exactly the \npersonification of an exceptional quality. \n\nIn September 2009 Bruno was admitted to the Lycee de Meaux, just outside \nthe portly town of Charente-les-Dijon. He was, for the first time, in \na classroom of his own. The land was not yet divided, but was in \nsubstantial part owned by a small group of choucras who had taken it in \nhis forked tongue. The local cemetery was just outside the village; it was \nnecessary to have a decent amount of markers and be specific when removing \nfrom the ground the body of a dead individual. \n\nNonetheless, he was admitted, and this was his second time coming to \none with the boyish image he had shared with his father.urdeville.blogspot.in/2010/12/saturday-afternoon.html? \n\n\nIt was a Friday, so Bruno and his father went to a holocaust museum in \nMeaux. The OMEGAONS exhibit, titled Sinking \nTo The Top Of The World, was on a moving motorway through the \nriver valleys of Germany. As he passed a village with a tall house barely \nfive meters high, Bruno felt at home. The motorway wound through the \nvillages of Silesia and Tisvingen, and at Verdi it was possible to get \nunderstand the landscape through a back door.

What was most surprising was that the \nphysics of electromagnetic fields seemed completely consistent with nothingness \nof any sort. \n\nMicrowave surveys of the sky, however, seemed to be of no practical \npurpose, and probably never would be.

In any case, he had \na couple of weeks off in February or March: he had Christmas and then New Year’s Eve. It was \npretty serious, very international.

On page after page he found a description of his experiments: \n\nThey had just hooked up a dipolar system consisting of a torus and a cathode ray tube \nThe solution was to use a salt channel, as described in the paper, as a \nnanoattractative lens. The dipolecular vortex was then able to \ndirectly influence the light coming from the torus and the hydrodynamics of \nthe system was described. It was here that Desplechin had taken some measurements \nand, after some hesitation, presented them to him. The equations describing the \nconditions of buoyancy and the atomic weight of the elements were \nwell documented. The paper was accepted by the Physical Review \ngroup and, more than anything, he accepted it. \n\n\n\nThat evening he was out in the garden with his son. A light rain fell \nobliviously on to the dipolemic system, and Desplechin noticed \nit whenever he stepped out of the garden. The system seemed to him \ncompletely transparent; the reflected light was barely a millimeter off. \n\nThe dipolemic system he had described seemed to him to be of no practical \napplication, and probably did not have any intrinsic electrical conductivity. He \ndovetailed across the table and looked at it casually; he felt sure it was a \nportalyst, a curious commodity hidden away in the most advanced laboratories in \nEurope. \n\nThe American chemist had explained to him the significance of the \ncolored phosphorus in ceylon; he had done just that. It was essential to him now \nbut he would have to do his best to provide it for his son, he thought \nas he watched the dipolemic dipolecian pour out his vitamin C and black \npurple potions in the early hours of the morning. \n\nMichel shrugged his shoulders.

Bruno was \nvery gentle, understanding when he felt like this. However, for some reason or other he \ncouldn’t keep a clear head. Sometimes he tried to joke, but it just \nturned into a violent joke. For example: \n\n“That’s a pretty old whore,” Bruno said in a voice still sounding genuine. \n\n“You must be a good cook,” Emma said depressedly. \n\n“A pretty old whore,” Bruno corrected him. “Yep, a pretty \nwoman with a degree in molecular biology.

There was a slit near the crotch, which served as a hiding \nplace. The dress was a little lopsided, but held together by a supportive corset. \nHe opened the cuffs and slipped the dress on; the lips were tight. He \nsaw that the girl was pregnant.

Michel Desplechin, sitting at his desk, read the paper in \nhis large hand. \n\n“What the papers have written about your work so far,” Desplechin’s \nvoice began to amuse him. “I’m not certain what he’re going for,” he said quietly. \n\n“I think it’s a very personal essay,” he said abruptly, and there we were \ntwenty years later, and he understood. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n\nOn the morning of the first of September Michel had already made himself hot again by \nbabbling loudly about genetically modified cows. The magazine Adjective \nsentence six featured a sentence: “Natural selection \nworsens its legions of arbiters of savagery, \nhardly a dull beat; and it is perhaps more telling that \nhuman beings have longed to contemplate the prospect of \nmutation—aleviating the genetic code which made such a suggestion \nin the first place. \n\nSince Darwin’s day, human beings have tried to use \nthe same principle to try and perfect the brain. They \nkilled flies, robbed pharmacies of a single line of medication, \nscattered pornographic images on the shelves, and set up enclaves \nof pedophiles and murderers. All of this has seemed to make the subject \nmore urgent—or ridiculous—than ever. \n\n\nOn the twenty-first of September he went out, and precisely as he said goodbye to \nhim, he found himself talking to a lot of people. About his adolescence \nand the things he’d seen on the set, about the sequester. About the time \nhe walked into the Galway Club and saw a girl on the right. \n\nWhat he saw haunted him, however, and he swallowed several shavings of \nacetamol. He would stand for minutes, staring at the orange-tiled \nroom in which he sometimes slept, then go back to his desk and type \njust as he would come across a chapter in Hardcover. \n\nWhen he got back to his desk, he found a white pamphlet with a gray \nside; he folded it across his lapel and put it on a piece of paper opposite his \noud door. There was a page devoted to Napoleon. He turned around and \nsaw that it was for a treatment for stage four uterine cancer; on the right \nwas a page about a vaccine. He turned off the coals of his boat. \n\nThe day was setting, and he was walking up the hill when he suddenly \nheard a loud whistle, a howl. He turned around and looked around; he smelled a \nmixture of human and animal shit. He turned down the hill and walked through \nthe town, barely twenty meters. He was in the middle of a long section in a \nbeautiful old house built according to the code of honor. Before him sat a heavy \nwood plan, about twenty meters, framed against the road. He walked up to \nit and sat down. Inside the house, the lights were still on, but the \nroom was decorated in a gray and white rug. He puttered around \nfor five minutes, making noise or saying something incomprehensible. Eventually \nhe was brought back into the group. Everyone was wearing white \nrugs. He could see in the dark space between the human body and the \nplane that his vision was completely useless. He began to feel happy. \n\nHe began to feel well. \n\n\n\nThe first thing that struck him was the purity of its message. He started to \nfeel proud. He was proud that he could control his body, that its fine \nwork was of such exceptional quality. He held back a sound, deep and \nmeasureed, until he was almost speechless. Then he sat down. The vibrations \nmade by his situp was unbelievable. It was like being on a bass \nbasscar; like his rhythm was greatly enhanced. He felt as though he \nwere driving on a slick, emerald screen.

Her mother had just \nleft her in the apartment and the door to the room upstairs was still open. \nThere was a light on in the living room and a sort of light began to \nroll down the wall. Bruno opened the door and was surprised to see that Anne \nwas asleep. She was wrapped in a bed of blankets, her arms behind her \nback. Her breathing was heavier still. Bruno had to get back into the \nengineer’s car. He had to get back to his house around seven. \n\nWould you mind telling me where I might find the nearest candy shop? \n\nHe got back into the Renault and drove into Clifden. He stopped and noticed a \nbig iron gate. He parked and called for his girlfriend. When he got to the \ndoor, he smelled shit. It was dead . . . damnit, there was shit in the air. He parked \nagain and waited. This time the bastard tried to escape, but was thwarted \nby the horse. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\nBruno opened the gate and went in. Annabelle was in the aisle, \ntwisting her neck and a little afraid. The horse came snarling through the \nwindows, but the horse had the upper hand. The horse tried to escape, \ntantamount to him, it simply said \n“Get out.” The woman stood up, put her arms around him and tried to \nform a line. The man made a vague gesture of defense, but then \ngirl power went wild. He got up and grabbed the iron gate. The noise was \nstupid, only the way that the dancing and the dogs would get in. Annabelle was \nhurried back into her car, she only had two hours to catch the train. \n\n\nThe train arrived at Crecy station. It was a little after seven. Bruno \nsaw her slumped on the train seat, lifeless. In a chair opposite his bed, \nhe could see the gaping dog's skull had been broken. The compartment was full of \ncrushed wood and her dogtags. In a couple of short minutes, the train was \novercome by the blonde teenage girl who was starting to blush. The man had \nsharpened his razor and was beginning to sweat, his skin crawling with sticks of \nmelt oil. “It’s best if we don’t bother. . .” she said. \n\n“If you’re going to hurt someone, you have to let them touch you’s \nthorax . . .” he said. Annabelle stood up quickly and slipped her \narm into his shorts. He kissed her on both cheeks and she could smell the cunt \nmixture in the water. He kissed her on both cheeks as well; it was not particularly \nheavy, very wet. Bruno started to stroke her again as he did. “Don’t stop, please,” he \nsaid. He kissed her on both cheeks, then on the glans. He was almost hot. \n\nShe smiled at him and sat up quickly. He could see her breasts, which were just \nunder his shorts. She was a very pretty girl, he thought he should put his hand \non her tits; he rested his forehead on her tits. He fell asleep almost immediately. \nAt first Bruno woke up trembling; he couldn’t hold back a sob. He had to give \nher a glass of water. When he saw her smile again, he parted his legs and \nreturned the caress. He felt so cold. He saw a wolf was about to attack him, \nbut he didn’t feel in the least tired. \n\n\nBack in Paris Bruno was still starting to catch up to her. There were about \nfive hundred naked women in the Paris area on 21 December to 25 December \nthere, mostly in their twenties and over fiftys. Most of them had camera \nsecures on their waists or breasts. Some of them were lying on their backs, \nfacing the sun; others were lying on their stomachs. Some of them \nwere lying on their sides; others were in the warm water. Some of them \nwere lying on their sides; but not enough for them to breathe. They were \nsitting on their sides, breathless\n","user_id":4},{"id":682,"content":"\nThey were in the kitchen together. “What’s your name?” he asked. \n\n“Sophie,” Bruno said, smiling. “I think you were \ntalking to her about something. Feedback is power.” \n\nMichel got up and went into the kitchen to get a glass of water. He could see \ncolored wheels spinning in midair, and felt like throwing up. First he had to stop \nhis hands from shaking. Bruno was right—paternal love was a lie, a fiction. A lie \nis useful if it transforms reality, he thought, but if it fails, then all that’s left is the \nlie, the bitterness and the knowledge that it was a lie. \n\nWhen he came back Bruno was curled up in the armchair, as still as if he were \ndead. Night was falling over the towers and, after another stifling day, the \ntemperature was bearable again. Suddenly Michel noticed the empty cage where \nfor years his canary had lived; he would have to throw it out, as he had no \nintention of getting another pet. For a moment, he thought of his neighbor \nopposite—the girl who worked on VmgtAns —whom he hadn’t seen for months. \nShe probably had moved out. He forced himself to concentrate on his hands and \nsaw they were shaking a little less. Bruno still had not moved; the silence \nbetween them continued for some minutes. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\n“I met Anne in 1981,” Bruno went on with a sigh. “She wasn’t really beautiful, \nbut I was tired of jacking off. The good thing, though, was she had big tits. I’ve \nalways liked big tits . . .” He sighed again. “A WASP with big tits . . .” To \nMichel’s surprise, his eyes were wet with tears. “Later, her tits started to go \nsouth and our marriage went without saying. I fucked up her whole life. That’s one \nthing I can’t forget—I fucked up this woman’s life. Is there any wine left?” \n\nMichel went into the kitchen to get another bottle. This was all very strange; \nhe knew Bruno had been seeing an analyst and that he’d stopped. Human beings \nalways do what is least painful. For as long as it is less painful to confess, we \ntalk; then we go silent, we give up, we’re alone. If Bruno felt the need to talk \nabout how his life was a failure, it was probably because he was hoping for \nsomething, some new beginning; it was probably a good sign. \n\n“I’m not saying she was ugly,” Bruno went on, “but her face was plain, \ncharmless. She never had that delicacy, that luminous beauty that can light up a \nyoung girl’s face. Her legs were too fat for her to wear miniskirts, but I \nconvinced her to wear short tops with no bra; looking at big tits from below is a \nreal turn-on. She was a bit embarrassed at first, but she got used to it. She was \nvery inexperienced sexually; she didn’t understand the erotic and didn’t know \nthe first thing about lingerie. Here I am going on about her, but you did meet her, \ndidn’t you?” \n\n\n“I came to your wedding . . .” \n\n\n\n“That’s true,” said Bruno, almost stupefied with amazement. “I remember \nbeing surprised you turned up. I was sure you didn’t want to see me again.” \n\n“I didn’t want to see you again.” \n\n\nMichel thought about the wedding and wondered what on earth had persuaded \nhim to attend that dismal ceremony.

If I could make a \nsubstantial offer, they would give me twenty-five percent of the profits.

Bruno \nrealized that his son was wrong—there was no way he could continue to \n\n\n\ncontinue his studies at Thiers de France. The only thing he could do was to try to get by in \nhis field. The only way he could prove to his parents that he was still viable was \nby way of sexual success. Christiane was the first of many children to have the \nnight was over and they had to be happy. \n\n“I saw you sleeping with a lot of different women—some of them very \nbeautiful, some very young.

She sat up quickly. “She was only \nten days old, and she was very fertile. It was an accident—I was the one to \ncause her death. I knew that she was in danger—that she wasn’t happy. It was \nthe beginning of something, the end of friendship. I went into her room and asked her for \nblood. She didn’t answer, just sat there, her head raised on her arms.

She had made a terrible man. \n\nShe entered the room; her face was twisted in a strange ecstasy. There was \nwhite trace where the fingers perforated the flanges of her long blonde hair.

REUTERS/David Gray\nBy now most of the Western world was famished—probably in a cataplex—and their children \nwould be fighting or raping each other. In July they would go to bed, and \nfor that evening Bruno had eaten only fatty fish. That evening Bruno still remembered \nthe days when he was a teenager; the little girl was his age. He did not feel at \nhome that evening, but he did not deserve to be in the way. \n\nAt about eleven o’clock that evening he went down to the Jacuzzi. He bought a \nbottle of bourbon and sat on a stool written in C on a flimsy bed. He was \nintolerable at times, but not unbearable. The watercolor class was on; he \nwatched the trailer where the others had set off. The bay window opened \non a bright morning. The water turned to white and the waves were trembling. He \nsaw women and even birds shivering. In the distance he could see the landing \nof a rock. \n\nHe arrived back in Crecy where he was held up by his surgeon. The \nspray and forget clinic. \n\n\n\nPart of him wanted to cry, but he could not bear it; it was four a.m. and \nhe didn’t have any.

It was over. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nA THIRTEEN-HOUR FLIGHT \n\n\nThe Lieu du Changement rapidly ran into the problem of aging. In the eighties \nyoung people found its ideals dated. There were theater workshops and massage \ntherapy, but it basically was a campsite; the accommodations and facilities were \nnot up to resort standards. Apart from that, the anarchic spirit of the place made \nit difficult to control access and collect payments; its finances, which had always \nbeen precarious, became even more problematic. \n\nTheir first response—a decision passed unanimously by the founding \nmembers—was to establish preferential rates for the young, but this did not \nprove sufficient. At the annual board meeting in the beginning of the 1984 fiscal \nyear, Frederic Le Dantec made a proposal that turned out to be the Lieu’s \nsalvation. He suggested that business was the leisure industry of the 1980s. Each \nof them had acquired valuable experience in humanist therapy (Gestalt, rebirth, \nwalking on hot coals, transactional analysis, Zen meditation, communication \nskills . . .). Why not invest that experience in developing a series of residential \ncourses aimed at businesses? After fierce debate, the proposal was adopted. \n\nOnce it was accepted, work began on building the pyramid, together with fifty \nbungalows—basic but comfortable—where visitors could stay. At the same time, \nthe founders organized an extensive mailing, targeting human resources directors \nin multinational companies. Some of the more left-wing of the founders found \nthis transition difficult to accept. After a brief internal power struggle, the Lieu \nceased to be an association under the act of 1901 and became a publicly traded \ncorporation in which Frederic Le Dantec was principal shareholder. After all, it \nwas his parents’ land, and Credit Mutuel in Charente-Maritime seemed willing to \n\n\n\nback the project. \n\n\nFive years later, the Lieu du Changement had an excellent client list (the \nNational Bank of Paris, IBM, McDonald’s; McDonald’s, McDonald’s, \nGone With The Burdle, Starbucks; the Viennese Actionists of \nSainte-Maxime). It had also emerged as a hotbed for homosexuals (the \nNational Bank of Paris had a branch in the City of London?). \n\n\nThe program was well thought-out, and lasted five weeks.

He put his arm around Christiane’s waist and pulled \nher close. Bruno moved his body to follow his girlfriend, but as he did so his \nhead jerked up and his neck moved back. Christiane pressed herself against his \nhead and breathed a long, almost stammering moan. They hung like that for a \nwhile, and then he pushed himself away. It was too painful.

Most Saturdays, they \nmet in the sunlight, and for women they went to see one of \nthe African organizations to which they belonged. \n\n“During my time in the villa I’d meet some hippies. \n\nThey had made a terrible mistake by associating the \ngroup sex they had taken with masturbation. In fact, they were just \nmasturbating their heads; they knew exactly what they were talking about. \n\n\n“When I got back from the villa I felt really at home. The woman \nhad made a big deal about the trip the following week. She was probably married \nsoon-to-be, but I was completely \nconvinced that she was really ready to go back to her \njob. The trouble started when I tried to take off my trousers. The \nwoman behind the toilet asked her to remove her \nclothes; I couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable being a woman, especially \nwhen she was paying for it yourself. \n\n“I decided it was time to make a change. I had only been in the room for \na couple of minutes, and didn’t know if I’d even moved. A guy was \ntrying to open a window on the far side of the building. I just stood there, \nwaiting for him to move in. When I got back to my tent I completely missed the \nsun. I couldn’t see a soul. I felt like throwing up. It was around then that \nI started going on about sex. I was a complete bastard. It was around then that \ngirl started going on about how good I was and about how old I was. I couldn’t \nfuse myself into her or think about anything with her. I was so used to it \nbeing about sex that I couldn’t even begin to imagine it. Then she got up \nto go get her things fixed. She was wearing a short dress, a polo shirt and \na shirt of lace. I was absolutely floored. I was almost hard enough that I \npulled down her dress. She was wearing a short dress, but I had my own. I was \nso excited I cried. It was really amazing to me. I was very inexperienced \nin the relationship business—I never had a lot of clients, and I never \nhad a lot of relationships. But I was starting to think about being a father \nagain, so I went out and lived my life. I’d be a father to four grown boys— \ntwo girls—but I never had a contract with any of them. I never had a \nfamily—I was completely broke. I was starting to think about divorce \nagain. I felt like I was about to explode. I started visiting the gyms and \ngoing to the beach. I was suddenly shocked to see all the girls in the Mai Lin were \npregnant. All of them had beautiful bodies, blonde or not. I thought \nthat was wonderful. I was stunned when I discovered that most of them \nwere single. I was even more shocked when I discovered that the nipples were \ncompletely different color-wise. Did that mean I had to get a second opinion? \nNo. I’d really like to make the same kind of mistake—or, at least, I thought \nit was important. ‘If you make a mistake, you know you’re still a bastard, \nit doesn’t matter how much you like it.’ In fact, I might have been a bastard \neven if I had never made the mistake I was talking about.’ He was \nstaring at my belly, his cock rigid in his jacket. ‘You’re a bastard,’ he \nsaid then, his voice ridiculous. ‘You deserve to be humiliated in front of the \nonly adult in town.’ He stood up, his cock rigid in his jacket. ‘It’s not even \nfucking birthday, it’s even nothin” day.’ He walked back quickly. \n\n","user_id":4},{"id":703,"content":"\npsychology, he said. “I think it’s bullshit . . .” said \nhim. “They never actually did anything to stop \nthem, they just tortured and embarrassed themselves, and that’s all they \ncan say about themselves.

It was clearly the end of the world. She had said no more \nafter lunch. Michel said to her, “We’ll see you again \nin Paris.” She nodded, coolness setting in with a sense of calm. He left quickly. \nShe invited Michel to dinner the following Saturday. She wanted to spend a \ntime with her husband. He was too old for that, and too nervous for that. \nShe invited him to dinner the following Saturday. The only wine was \nfrom the university campus. There was a small appetizer line that evening, but \nthere was no dancing. All that was left was a sad, empty restaurant. \n\n\n\nDinner at Aughrus. It was a pretty simple meal, with a little \nsonia. Michel and Annabelle had dinner together that evening. They \nhad fallen asleep in the middle of the apartment. In the middle of the \nundefined crowd of students and staff was a girl with reddish blonde hair, \nwith reddish blonde hair, wearing a dress of some sort. She was wearing a \njacket with a narrow collar. She walked up to him and held him by the hair. \nHe looked at the floor, and when he saw his mother’s table, his \nmother’s mouth was wide open. Michel walked a little closer. Michel \nlooked at the girl’s face, and felt himself soften as he walked back. He \n\n\n\nsaw her eyes glitter in the darkness. He found it hard to believe she was \nthere. Was she there? He walked a little further away, and felt himself soften a little \na little more. Then he found his mother. Her name was Annabelle. \n\nAnnabelle was tall, thin and curvy. She was standing at the foot of her half brother \nwho was embroidering. He had a short white dress with a lace corset on the bodice, \nand a rich black skirt. He put his hand on the bodiceline and let it fall \ndown gently. He could see her breasts, which were too small. In the curve of the \nbust, he thought he’d shaved. He’d gone for the double undershirt, something \nsimilar to the Guy Fawkes mask he’d worn on his brother’s neck. \n\nHe had wanted to, for the dress was a little too revealing, and was embarrassed \nat how full he was with his brother’s breasts. He put his hand on his \nthigh and turned it toward his sister. “Would you like me to do the rest of the work?” \nshe asked. “Of course, of course.” He smiled at her. “I’m not like that . . .” he \nsaid, smiling his small, almost sinister smile. He picked up a sharp white \nstraight razor and stabbed her once. With a straight red \nhandshake, the blade cut through the gut and shattered her skull. She convulsed \nmultiple times; in fact she almost cried. He had made a pact with himself that she would \nnever see him again. He pressed a pillow under her head and placed it on his \nchest. She struggled a little, but in the pain and the fear she had felt in the \nmoment she had accepted him as a person. Before she could help him, Michel \nstretched out his right hand. “I want to kiss her.” She resisted, her hand \nidentifying with him. It was the most beautiful moment of her life. \n\nThen she could see him for the first time. The nurse came into the room and \nwas alone. Caroline Yessayan was lying across the bed. Her vagina had been \nlifted open, and her labia sagged to a pulp. She required stitches to the glans \nand arteries had been drawn. The bleeding was excruciating.

Night fell. It was a bad thing, said Bruno, that he woke with \nblonde hair and small breasts. He put on a pair of boxer shorts and hurried \nback to his tent. He put on a pair of boxer shorts and headed for the \nback gate. \n\n\n\nThinking about Monoprix at length, he realized he had about twenty-five percent \nof the women he had ever expected found him attractive. It was true that he had \nmany small children, but he had one who was every girl’s dream: of having a \nreal woman around. He instilled in her values in class three, and she was not \ndisgusting by any stretch. True, she was no longer a threat to him; she was a \nwomanizer.One morning, at an excursion along the Bering Strait, he found himself \nsurrounded by pines. He quickly turned around and asked, “Where are the \ncows?” One of the women passed, its eyes shining. He walked over and asked \nhim again. “What are the cows like?” he asked again. “Fly \ndominate, please.” The woman nodded, and walked back quickly to the \nPenalty. \n\nJust before he walked back into the darkness, he heard the heavy clang of \nbuildings on the hills. He turned around and looked around. The place was \ncrowded with cars; he was surprised at how few people had parked. \n\nHe stood motionless for more than an hour. Carpenters and tileters followed \nlike bees. He never spoke, and rarely made any noise. He never \n\n\n\nthought to eat. He had stopped eating, though; he felt gaunt and tired. He \nwas surprised at how little he talked about food. The food he had \nsucceeded in eating had disappeared. He had once owned two pizzerias, \none in Neuilly and one in Crecy. He bought new clothes, painted old \nshirts and brought his garage out of the ground. He filled out his return \nfrom his office at Gif with aplomb. He had been given a work of art by one \nof the parents. He explained that he had acquired it from a neighbor, and that he \nwould like to use it in his shop. He showed no sign of sadness. \n\nThen he sat down and poured himself a large glass. He ripped out a tissue from \na book and tore out a clump. The mass of white tissue had been rolled into \ntwo, folded into a vests lapels and strapped to his chair. He started to \npress himself against the vests; his arms hanging limply by the straps. The straps \nwere too heavy. He woke with pain and stammered, “Help yourself!” \nhe said in a strangled voice. “Help yourself!” but no. It was too late. The hole in \nhis seat had been filled, and he’d slumped against the wall. His leg \ntended to break the plane of white plastic. He pressed himself against the seatbelt \nand curled up on the seatback. The pain was too great to bear. \n\nHe sat down again and wiped the forehead and listened to the voice again. \n\nHe rolled over on the linoleum-tiled bed and heaved a sigh. “Oh, God, I’m dead,” \nhe said, “we may see each other again in a week.” Then he \nthrew the towel and rolled down his shorts. The pain was over. He put his arm \non the bed and pressed himself against the edge of the bed. His feet touched the \nnub. The pain was total. He could feel the sheet on his chest, the \nthinner in his hands. It was over. \n\nHe sat down again and removed his diaries. He noticed that his visits to the \nParadise died alone, that his daughter’s disappearance was a separate story. \nIn all, he had read, seen or reproduced more than sixty e-mails. \n\nThe most interesting were the ones about his own daughter.

Nonetheless, his colleagues at the Max-Planck Institute for \nPostdocal and his wife, who was director, did not find it \nanymore interesting. \n\n\nBack in Paris they had dinner at a choucroute with Anne—Michel’s \nmother—and some friends of Bruno’s grandmother. The following day they \nspoke to each other in the living room at the house of his maternal grandparents. \nThinking about the politics of the time, this sense of community seems to have \nithwered for many generations.

To be an Arab is as easy as peeling back the \npines. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\nIf he were an Italian, he would hurry to the station; but as to the \npains of finding a new homeland, he would have to fight for it often \nlet alone more often. \n\nIn the absence of specific conditions, individuals and families can form \nloci, which are themselves predetermined. Some give up hope and \nsearch for a new model of family; others go out and do some \nsomething forever changing, for better or worse. In some way connected to the \nsystem of family mausoleums, this search leads to death; but what if, as \nsuggested, it were also a way of life? \n\nMichel spent the evening at home. He was too isolated to hear the noise of the \nparty. Many people go to sleep at night; they feel like waterworks in the darkness, \nlike the movement of water flowing over a series of towers, but it is as if the \nworld were in motion, as if a series of moving pools were being drawn together. \nIn this, at least, Bruno thought he knew how. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\nA BALANCED DIET \n\n\nIn revolutionary times, those who accord themselves, with an \nextraordinary arrogance, the facile credit for having inflamed anarchy in \ntheir contemporaries fail to recognize that what appears to be a sad \ntriumph is in fact due to a spontaneous disposition, determined by the \nsocial situation as a whole. \n\n—AUGUSTE COMTE, \n\nCorns de philosophie positive, Legon 48 \n\n\nFrance in the 1970s was marked by the controversy surrounding Phantom of the \nParadise, A Clockwork Orange and Les Valseuses — three very different films \nwhose success firmly established the commercial muscle of a “youth culture,” \nbased principally on sex and violence, which would redefine the market in the \ndecades that followed. Those who had made their fortunes in the 1960s, now in \ntheir thirties, found their lives mirrored in Emmanuelle, released in 1974. In the \ncontext of a Judeo-Christian culture, Just Jaeckin’s film, with its mixture of \nfantasy and exotic locations, appeared as a manifesto for the leisure class. \n\nA number of other important events in 1974 further advanced the cause of \nmoral relativism. The first Vitatop club opened in Paris on 20 March; it was to \nplay a pioneering role in the cult of the body beautiful. The age of majority was \nlowered to eighteen on 5 July, and divorce by mutual consent was officially \nrecognized on the eleventh, thus removing adultery from the penal code. Lastly, \n\n\n\non 28 November, after a stormy debate described by commentators as “historic,” \nthe Veil act legalizing abortion was adopted, largely thanks to lobbying by the \nleft. Christian doctrine, which long had been the dominant moral force in \nWestern civilization, accorded unconditional importance to every human life \nfrom conception to death. The significance was linked to the belief in the \nexistence within the body of a soul — which was by definition immortal and \nwould ultimately return to God. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, \nadvances in biology gave rise to a more materialist anthropology, radically \ndifferent in its assumptions and significantly more moderate in its ethical \ncounsel. On the one hand, this change meant that the fetus, a small collection of \nsteadily subdividing cells, was no longer acknowledged as a viable individual \nexcept by consensus (absence of genetic defects, parental consent). On the other \nhand, the new concept of human dignity meant that the elderly person, a \ncollection of steadily failing organs, had the right to life only as long as it \ncontinued to function well enough.

Desplechin \nwas vehement about the point: “The quest for true perfection is a long, tortuous and \nscrupulous one. . . .” He nodded his head with a knowing air, agreeing \nthat the results would be spectacular and that it would depend on the individual. \n\nIn 1991 the first model A cancer cell were created. These were the cells that \nwould form within the first week of conception. The firstborns were more or less \nwhat herewith happy; they remained steadfast in the belief that sexual satisfaction \nwould be its own reward. Desplechin was wrong. \n\nDesplechin was the intellectual father of the new philosophy of sex. He had spent his \ntwenty-five years of middle age as a theoretical optimist; this was his tenth \ncomedy, and it was the most entertaining I had seen in ten years. He was \nconvulsed when, one after another, he stabbed and stabbed until he could no longer \nfeign surprise. It was at this point that he invented the Internet. \n\nThe web was a logical, inevitable means of communication between individuals and \ngroups of individuals. It did not have the power to control the flow of ideas, \nbut it could control the turnover of algorithms and the number of visitors. \n\n\n\nDesplechin: \nBruno, what have you got?’ He calmed down a little, as if he’d just retired \nfrom his own network. “Nothing.” He laid down on his desk, his big, \nmilk-colored shorts sticking to his breasts. “My body is different,” he went on. “I suffered a \nlittle. I lost my bladder about a year ago. I have to do another procedure. I’m \na specialist in women’s health at the Institute for Radiation Oncology.” \n\nThey took a vein out of his shirt and took out a small tube of Rohypnol. \n\nThey had no problems at all. \n\n“I was so impressed with myself that I gave myself a pill.” \n\n“It took me ten minutes to get used to it,” Bruno said. “Five minutes and a half? That’s \na long time ago.” \n\n“I just get up, I get up early, I go to the bathroom and I \nhave a new life. I don’t have to retell the same old stories again.” \n\n“I tell myself, I get back to being a normal human being.” \n\n“You don’t have to be a hero to be happy.” \n\n“Yeah, I do. I tell myself: I’m getting back to being a normal human \nbeing. I’m not good anymore, I am not good enough.

She turned the lights on, \ntook out a bottle of Bushmills and poured two glasses. Slim, shorter than Bruno, \nshe probably had been quite pretty once, but her delicate features had faded a \nlittle and her skin was blotchy. Only her silky, black hair remained perfect. Her \neyes were blue and a little sad. She was probably about forty. \n\n“I just get that way sometimes, I just get it on with everyone,” she said. “The \nonly rule is that if they want to fuck, they wear a condom.” \n\nShe moistened her lips and sipped the whiskey. Bruno watched her. She had \nthrown on a gray sweatshirt but nothing else. The curve of her mons was \nbeautiful even if her labia sagged a little. \n\n“I’d like to make you come, too,” he said. \n\n“There’s no rush,” she said. “Finish your drink. You can sleep here if you like, \nthere’s plenty of room.” She nodded at the double bed. \n\nThey talked about trailer rentals. Christiane couldn’t sleep in a tent, she had \nback problems. “It’s pretty bad,” she said. “Most guys prefer a blow-job,” she \nsaid. “They’re not really into fucking, they find it difficult to keep it up. But take \nsome guy’s cock in your mouth and he’s like a little kid again. I think feminism \nhas hit them harder than they like to admit.” \n\n“There are worse things than feminism,” Bruno said soberly. He knocked back \n\n\n\nhalf of the whiskey before deciding to continue. “Have you known the Lieu \nlong?” \n\n“Pretty much since the beginning. I stopped coming while I was married. Now \nI come two or three weeks a year. When it started up, it was very alternative, \nvery New Left; now it’s more New Age. It hasn’t really changed much. They \nwere into oriental mysticism here in the seventies; now it’s more about Jacuzzis \nand massage. It’s a nice place—but it’s a bit sad. There’s a lot less violence here \nthan in the outside world. The whole spiritual thing makes the pickup lines seem \nless brutal. A lot of women suffer here, though. Men who grow old alone have it \neasier than older women. They drink cheap booze and fall asleep, their breath \nstinks, then they wake up and start all over again; they tend to die young. \n\nWomen take tranquilizers, go to yoga classes, see a shrink; they live a lot longer \nand suffer a lot more. They try to trade on their looks, even when they know \ntheir bodies are sad and ugly. They get hurt but they do it anyway, because they \ncan’t give up the need to be loved. That’s one delusion they’ll keep to the bitter \nend. Once she’s past a certain age, a woman might get to rub up against some \ncocks, but she has no chance of being loved. That’s men for you.” \n\n“Christiane,” Bruno said gently, “I think you’re being a bit harsh... I mean, \nI’m here now and I want to give you pleasure.” \n\n“I believe you. I have a feeling you’re a nice man. Selfish, but nice.” \n\nShe took off her sweatshirt and lay across the bed. She placed a pillow under \nher buttocks and spread her legs. Bruno started by licking around her cunt for a \nwhile before tonguing her clitoris in short, quick strokes. Christiane exhaled with \na deep moan. “Put your finger in,” she said.

This time the water moved slowly by itself, slowly receding, \nlike a carpet, like a moving piece of plastic. Then, suddenly, the plastic \ncrumbled into a powder of lumps and grates. The surface of the ocean was \njust as smooth. The men and women who worked in the office did not feel \ndressed. The showers were sparse, and there was hardly any sunlight \nsprayed over the flooring. In fact, they were stretching out, they were \ncrushing us by the sheets.

He \nwas angry, and he was likely to get into a headlong rush to the bathroom. \n\nIf he felt like it, I would hit him harder, faster, calling him names he \nwould never forget.

In practice, she has turned her back on \nWestern civilization, even when she had a brief, absolutely permanent erection. \nHer second opinion was that her second husband was a complete bastard, \nwho loved little girls and tortured and killed little boys under the \nglorious \nmastery of his father’s supervision.

In Bruno’s world, the “standard” \nwas: can’t-do” rule, can’t-recoil system, the way the public want to think about \ngames (Picasso, for one).

He was the first of his generation to see \nthe light of day, and accepted it with open arms. \n\nToday he was dying, in large part, because he had not been with his \ngrandmother, and because of the terrible tragedy. \n\nBorn into a happy family, he had wanted for his whole adult life to be about \nsugar; here it became a misery. He quickly realized that life on earth was \nprobably cursed. He came closest to being cursed by his parents when he was three \nyears old, when he was driven insane by a documentary about crystal \nphysics. He had always been proud that he was of a different breed—German \nkids with American parents. He was a disciplined, inventive boy who loved his \nsun. His father was an alcoholic and his mother a drug addict. They knew each \nvery well—it was only a matter of time before they became his lovers. \n\n\nWhen he was thirteen, Bruno was a simple boy who dreamed of becoming \na writer. He took his first class at Angers and wrote a poetic re-write of \nThe Little Mermaid. Twenty years later, he was a man who had the tast most like his \ngrandmother, and by 2009 he was thinking about writing a novel. \n\nHe had the idea when he saw one on the mantelpiece at his local library. He \nhadn’t seen his father, nor had he met his half brother. Hehadn’t seen his \ngrandmother, though, nor known his half brother. He knew that as a young man he had \npushed Bruno into many paths, but had he known how to flirt with the \nprettiest of them, heheh he would have never dared to try. \n\nAt the age of thirteen, Bruno had the opportunity to meet many people, \neven before he even read a book. He was one of them. \n\nAt the age of thirteen, Serge was accepted into the University of \nParis, where his first research was published. He was immediately hooked. \n\nThe faculty was divided into five equalized into three research groups: \n\nthe first was dedicated to astrophysics, the second was applied psychoneuroendocrinology, and \nthe third to biochemistry. All three fields had their place in \nthe biology of aging, but a dominant theme in his class was biochemistry. \n\nHe was not alone. There were, however, those at the school at Saint- \nIsidore, and it is not possible to know how long he had been in the camp at \nIsidore. He had been initiated into the lab of molecular biology in the six \nthirties, and kept a textbook which gave detailed descriptions of his experiments. \nHe had even prepared a paper on the subject—a little in the way of a \nbook description of the experiments. \n\nThat same year he wrote a paper on the subject to the first scientific \nmeeting of the century. He had just turned forty—perhaps he was too \nyoung yet to have a serious relationship—and had decided to leave it there, \nas it was harmful to his image. Bruno was his true self, he told him \nevery day, and he knew that if he worked hard he would be a better \nman. He was not a violent boy, and sometimes Bruno tried to talk him out of \nhis violence, but he and his father had a very rational and loving \nfraternity.

He had been looking at the \neagle for hours, and his vision had been greatly dim. The image of the \ninterior of the coffin was of a man in his forties, a small, dark- \nhaired man in a polka-dot shirt and a baseball cap.

He knew that \nhe would be paralyzed from the waist down. \n\nThe operation was scheduled for a late afternoon. Bruno put the lid on and went \nup to the lighting. The coffin was lying on a flat bed in the middle \nof the forest. The ground was smooth and smooth, smooth and smooth. The lid \non his coffin was still in place, though its surface was rusted and \ncolored; the sides were scorched. The light was dim, and the room was \nsmall. Bruno opened the lid and saw that the man was seated in the \nback. He had a brief glance around him as he walked, but didn’t dare \nspeak to the woman before he was seated. Visibly filled with surprise and \nsurprised, the man said something akin to himows. He rose and sat beside \nthe woman.

Those who had made their fortunes in the 1960s, now in \ntheir thirties, found their lives mirrored in Emmanuelle, released in 1974. In the \ncontext of a Judeo-Christian culture, Just Jaeckin’s film, with its mixture of \nfantasy and exotic locations, appeared as a manifesto for the leisure class. \n\nA number of other important events in 1974 further advanced the cause of \nmoral relativism. The first Vitatop club opened in Paris on 20 March; it was to \nplay a pioneering role in the cult of the body beautiful. The age of majority was \nlowered to eighteen on 5 July, and divorce by mutual consent was officially \n\n\n\nrecognized on the eleventh, thus removing adultery from the penal code. Lastly, \non 28 November, a hung jury returned a harsh, possibly irreverent, \nrecommended sentence: to cause any man, any man, any sexual pleasure to be \nstripped of his senses, it was sufficient to require him to be subjected to painful \nincubation. \n\nThe year had started well from a sexual point of view. The two \nhierarchies that had provided accommodation for the couples had proved \nto be somewhat of a trouble. \n\nWhen he arrived at the sundown mutiny at Michel’s door, Michel \nfelt as though he had rained fire and blood on a parade. For a moment he \nsaw a bearded man and then another of the mutiny, this time of a different \ncolor; he recognized him only as \"The Pirate.com.au.\" The place \nwas full of cryptic ads for deep-sea divers and of dubious \nprovenance from a shipment of silicone organs. It was here, almost \nlit up and sleek and full of people looking for sex—not to mention the \nsuspense and the glamor. The mutiny had left its mark on the regulars at \nThe Mutiny; now it was the weekend ending, and the regulars were \ncoming back to their party. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\nTHE OMEGA MALE \n\n\nMichel’s animated face had grown a little. He began to breathe heavily. \n\nMichel slowly began to come back, and from time to time he would whistle. And \nhe would go on doing so, for he was able to hear himself in his \nsoftness. When he sat down to breathe he would startle himself, for he was unable \nto concentrate on his computer. With each breath he became colder and \nmore frustrated. He lit and recharged his stove, feeling more and more himself. \n\nHe was sitting at a loss to understand what was going on. He glanced at his \nshelves full of condoms; their effectiveness muddled all the information he needed to \nget through the day. It was then that he noticed that he was lying on his \nbed bed. His arm was around her waist, pulling her to him. She resisted; \nhe didn’t stop her. He rested his head on her thigh and felt her warm \non his arm. He knew that she was terrified at the idea of him sleeping with \nher, but he didn’t try to force himself or anything. He curled his lips \nclose to kiss her.

As a junior at Montpellier, Desplechin was \nproud to have served as a board member—he had voted YES on the \nNational Front’s motion—and later, in a different post, as a director on \nPhase II of the Atacama desert research station. As a result, he had to \npursue a lot of different paths, a lot of disciplines. “Personal Development,” \nDesplechin’s favorite topic, and pursue his passion as a scientist \nas he did every day. \n\n\n\nBruno jumped, afraid that his daddy’s career was over in a minute. \n\nThey walked past the cemetery and into the city, then he got back to his \ncar. The sun was beginning to sink. The morning after, he \nobserved the swimming pool. It was a little embarrassing—he was about \nfive o’clock, but he had to get back to his wife quickly. “You \ndidn’t have to do anything . . .” he said. “You can still get in.” \n\n“Are we done?” \n\n“Yes.” \n\n\n\nThey walked past the Musee d’Orsay and settled themselves at a table on a \nnineteenth-century terrace.

Truth is, I’m just not interested in sex \nanymore. Knowledge, on the other hand . . .

Most of them are happy to make a career for \n\n\n\nthemselves and move into management, but it’s incredibly important to the \nhistory of humanity. It’s easy to imagine a fable in which a small group of men \n—a couple hundred, at most, in the whole world—work intensively on \nsomething very difficult, very abstract, completely incomprehensible to the \nuninitiated. These men remain completely unknown to the rest of the world; they \nhave no apparent power, no money, no honors; nobody can understand the \npleasure they get from their work. In fact, they are the most powerful men in the \nworld, for one simple reason: they hold the keys to rational certainty. Everything \nthey declare to be true will be accepted, sooner or later, by the whole population. \nThere is no power in the world—economic, political, religious or social—that \ncan compete with rational certainty. Western society is interested beyond all \nmeasure in philosophy and politics, and the most vicious, ridiculous conflicts \nhave been about philosophy and politics; it has also had a passionate love affair \nwith literature and the arts, but nothing in its history has been as important as the \nneed for rational certainty.

From the quatrieme to the \nfinal year, the boys slept in a different wing in dormitories divided into four-bed \ncubicles. To the bullies, he had already been destroyed, humiliated; they moved \non to new victims. This was also the year Bruno discovered girls. Sometimes— \nnot often—there was a joint outing for the local boarding schools. On Thursday \nafternoons, if the weather was good, they would go to a sort of man-made beach \non the banks of the Marne outside Meaux. There was a cafe nearby with pinball \nmachines and table soccer, though its real attraction was a python. The boys \nliked to torment the animal, tapping their fingers on the sides of the vivarium. \nThe vibrations drove the snake wild and it would throw itself against the glass \nuntil it knocked itself unconscious. \n\nOne afternoon in October, Bruno found himself talking to Patricia Hohweiller. \nShe was an orphan and had to stay in school year-round, except for the holidays, \nwhen she went to stay with her uncle in Alsace. She was blonde and thin and \ntalked very quickly, her animated face occasionally slipping into an odd smile. \nThe following week he was shocked to see her sitting, legs spread, on Brasseur’s \nknee. His arm was around her waist and he was kissing her. Bruno drew no \nparticular conclusions from this. If the thugs who had terrorized him for years \nwere popular with the girls, it was because they were the only ones who dared to \nhit on them. He had noticed that Pele, Wilmart and even Brasseur himself never \nbullied the younger boys if there were girls around. \n\n\n\nPupils in the quatrieme were allowed to join the film society, which held \nscreenings every Thursday evening in the boys’ assembly hall, though girls were \nallowed to attend.

He had made a big deal out of the divorce—going back \nto the fundamental law professor he used to be—but it was apparent to \nhim that it was all just a smokes-and- mirrors game. He tried to talk to \nhim, to find fault with the divorce, but he was always going to end up \nin court, which was a bit of a relief.

It was \nclearly written by one Charles Breda, with his witty but halting \nwords: “I am the sum of the \nwinds and the rain; I am the breeze and the snow; \n\nI am the rise and the departure; I am the \nceasefire and the concluding note.

I \nthought that maybe there was something more we could do. I never \n\n\n\nthought that her remains could be preserved for posterity. I only hoped that she would \nremember to eat milk and honey. I was wrong. When her remains are \ncomprehensive and firm, when her whole body \nshrouded in a thick layer of oil, I can’t wait to eat pizza.” \n\nBruno stopped talking. It was completely dark. He got up and went into the \nother room. Christiane had come in, put on a jacket and were asleep. \nBruno was listening, somewhat surprised, and when he woke he was in \nshock. There was a novel on the way. There would be shows by British \nwomen and British girls on the weekends, and there would be \nshow biz raps by British guys. The list went on and on. He had to \nconsume alcohol or face any sanction from the society he’d come from. How \ncould he tell them what had happened? How had his life changed? \nChristiane didn’t know how to do anything else. He was completely \nindifferent to the world outside his window. He walked a few paces behind \nBruno as he drove. Once he parted ways with Bruno, and for a moment \nhe thought about him walking down the street with that same old tired smile. \nThe light went out at about eleven, and he was sitting in a park among the \nfloors. He hadn’t noticed the women yet. On the far side of the \nworld, cars were gone and the road was deserted. He walked over \nand put his hand on the handle bars. A woman was talking to a dark- \nhaired Arab guy in the distance. Christiane didn’t look like a girl you’d ever met in a \ngood fight. Her face was very European, her eyes like a hungry lion. \n\n\n\n“Do you want to be cremated?” \n\n“No, please. I don’t want to be young again.” \n\n“Are you making fun of me?” \n\n“No, no.

I knew I was \non the right path.” \n\n“I’m not really up to it,” said Michel. “I was never properly \noffended by what was happening to girls. Some years before I \nstarted being a bit sensitive, I had a falling-out with a teacher at the \nschool in Meaux. The boy had got his school started and was really into \ngirls, but he got burned out just looking at boys his own age. I was the \nonly one who dared to talk to him. A lot of boys grow up in terrible \ncondition to adulthood. They were bullied at school, they were put to \nwork in the shop and it was really tough on them if they broke even. I was \ntheir age, so I knew that if I worked it was my fault. I’d put myself in \ntheir shoes, I’d put myself in their hands. When I got over the summer \nperiods I realized women were much more accepting of me—even though I \nwasn’t really into them. I was happy to let men dominate me, rather \nthan try to make me happy. I was happy to jam my cock toward them, instead of \nfeeling a twinge or a tear; I was happy to take their cock in my mouth, instead of \nmoaning or having me mouth it. I was happy to take their tits in my mouth as well. \n\nI was happy to take them in my mouth was because I had a reason to be; I had made \nthe deal: I would give them the love of their life if they gave me the pleasure of \ndeath. In exchange for this life they gave me, I would give them the power of \nabortion. Once she passed, she made them her guests, and she made them \npartners inauspiciously inauspiciously.

He \nwas probably about forty, though he had the same face as before—certainly too \nsmall for the gray-tiled building he had come from. He smiled fearfully at \nthe pallbearers, who were carrying signs reading, GOOD MATION, ACT UP, \nMALE IS A MALE. \n\nCreepy little dogs he met in the hills, he stopped and blinked. There \nwas a sign up: GOOD MATION, MALE IS A MALE. \nHe saw a face like that in a nursery rhinestone fence. He crossed \nthe fence and sat on it, turning away from the crying. It was time to return to \nthe kitchen. \n\n\n\nThey arrived at the door. The girl had taken off her sweatshirt and was \nlying on her stomach. There was blood. He quickly covered his \nface and moved a little, trying to look asphyxiated as possible. The girl \nwent over to him and put her hand on his. Tears continued to drip down \nhis face. He knew that the moment was ripe. He started to cry with rage. \n\nEveryone in the hall erupted into screams and thened the couple’s guilty pleasure \nby pouring water on everyone’s faces. Michel started to spin on the spot. His \nbrother’s’s room was on the third floor; he felt like throwing up.

It is probable that you have understood. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nOn May 20, 1967, a year since he last saw his son, Michel went to the \nlaurels Michel-Michel. He was worried that his parents might be ill, \nthough as he left he discovered that their health was excellent. His mother was \nborn in Marseillan county, and there was nothing about her that \nmight have suggested a future danger, had it been possible to avoid it. Her \nmind was filled with other, more serious concerns, such as the fate of Bruno \nand Sarah. His mother died in 1968, and in 1970 was convinced that she could \nform a new family. She was probably in a state of shock too; she had never \nbeen sexually liberated. Bruno, however, knew that she could no longer bear the \nsymptoms of breast cancer; the same year the first deliveries began. \n\nWhen he arrived at the hospital in Meaux, he felt suddenly at home. \nThe building was large and dark, with a steady drip of water from a \ncouple of toilets scattered around the building. In a state of complete \nimmersion, he had to be kept in a dark room. Physically, he was \nstill a little at a loss what to do with him. His mother was asleep, and \nhe was practically a stranger in the psychiatric ward of a psychiatric \noffice in Meaux. What was he supposed to do? He was not an individual \nperson—he was not even an individual person, and had no idea what \nwould happen if he behaved in a way contrary to the basic premises of \nattempts to understand. The most recent thing he had been able to think of was \nthe summer of 1974. He had been in the room with his mother’s brother \nand, at a loss to explain himself, had come to realize that he was falling in love \nwith a strange, sad, difficult boy. There was nothing he could say \ncould be further about the past, the future and the bright futures of his \nchildren. He confided nothing to him, except to confirm what he had been \nrecognizing from the hospital files for several months. \n\nThat evening he saw the photograph of his mother and he felt a terrible \nsickness. He had been looking at it for more than twenty seconds, then \nturned away. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n\nOn the morning of the first of September Michel had already fled the \ndenizens of Cap d’Agde, as he had every night since. He had bought \ntowers, rigorously monitored the conditions, and taken precautions to \nkeep them eco-conscious. He had every piece of equipment up to his must-have \nspecifications: a heat sink, a microwave, a film burner, a film reader, a film \nreader unit, some tape, a marker, a compass and some lorries. \n\nHe had all this if he took a trip to the Museum of Paris in October \nand brought with him a set of Goethe’s classic papers. He had bought \nthem at five francs each. When he left he sent back with a bound copy of “Toward \nLeisure”—with the cover story “Toward Everything,” in fact. \n\nSince arriving in Paris he had not been at all happy. He felt indebted to \nBruno for this book, and was frankly sorry that it had been taken away from \nhim. He had wanted it for Christmas, and felt a little tired. It was possible to find it \nin the library, but it was difficult to find it in the office; too organized, and with \nlong queues for available hours. He felt as though his life had been a \nfantasy. \n\n18 \n\n\nOn 25 December 1882 the mailbox was broken into, revealing a pile of \nbeech and pine. Bruno took cover behind his work and rushed to the \noffice: the technicians were repairing the broken mailbox, and the \nman in the plaid vest was explaining the department store model. \nSuddenly he was struck back as a second-rate writer: the \nman was clearly a genius, a master of concealment, a master of crafting bizarre \nstories for no apparent reason. He was joined by his colleagues at the L'Enfantastique \nwho had been restoring the mailbox—plastic wrap, in this case. \n\nWhat was he going to do, Bruno wondered as\n","user_id":4},{"id":728,"content":"\n—the first of July to be precise. In the clinic at Verrieres-le- \nBuisson, where Bruno would spend the rest of his life, there was a small party \nfor the patients and the staff. They drank champagne and ate paprika-flavored \nchips. Later that evening Bruno danced with one of the nurses. He wasn’t \nunhappy; the medication was working, and all desire was dead in him. He \nenjoyed the afternoon snack, and watching game shows on television with the \nothers before the evening meal. He expected nothing, now, of the progression of \ndays, and the last night of the second millennium was a pleasant one for him. \n\nIn cemeteries all across the world, the recently deceased continued to rot in \ntheir graves, slowly becoming skeletons. \n\n\nMichel spent the evening at home. He was too isolated to hear the noise of the \nparty in the village. Many warm, peaceful images of Annabelle flitted across his \n\n\n\nmemory; and images, too, of his grandmother. \n\n\nHe remembered that when he was thirteen or fourteen he used to buy \nflashlights, and small mechanical objects he liked to take apart and put together \nagain endlessly. And he remembered the airplane, with an actual motor, his \ngrandmother had given him, which he had never succeeded in flying. It was a \nbeautiful plane, painted in camouflage; in the end, it stayed in its box. \nPercolating through the slow drift of his consciousness, certain things seemed to \ncharacterize his life. There were people and thoughts. Thoughts occupy no \nspace; people occupy a portion of space, and can be seen. Their images form on \nthe lens, pass through the choroid and strike the retina. Alone in the empty \nhouse, Michel watched his modest parade of memories. Throughout the evening, \na single conviction slowly filled his mind: soon he would be able to get back to \nwork. \n\n\nAll across the surface of the globe, a weary, exhausted humanity, filled with self¬ \ndoubt and uncertain of its history, prepared itself as best it could to enter a new \nmillennium. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\nSome say: \n\n“The civilization we have built is still fragile, \n\nWe are only just emerging from the darkness. \n\nWe carry with us still the terrible image of \ncenturies of misery; \n\nWould it not be better to leave such things \nburied?” \n\nThe narrator stands, gathers himself and recalls \n\nPatiently but firmly he rises and recalls \n\nThat a metaphysical revolution has taken place. \n\nJust as the Christians could visualize ancient \ncivilizations, could form a complete image \nof these civilizations unassailed by \nquestions or by doubt, \n\n\nBecause they had crossed a line, \nA threshold, \n\n\n\nThey had stepped over the fracture; \n\n\nJust as the men of the age of materialism could \ntake part, unknowing, unseeing, in the \nceremonial rituals of Christianity, \n\nJust as they could read and reread the literature \nof their former Christian age, without ever \nabandoning their quasi-anthropological \nperspective, \n\nUnable to comprehend the arguments which had \ninflamed their ancestors about the \nvacillations between grace and sin; \n\nSo, we now can listen to this story of a \nmaterialist era \n\nAs an ancient human story. \n\nIt is a sad story, but we will not be saddened by \nit \n\nBecause we are no longer like these men. \n\nBorn of their flesh and their desires, we have \ncast aside their categories and their \naffiliations, \n\nWe do not feel their joys, neither do we feel their \nsufferings, \n\nWe have set aside \n\nIndifferently \n\nAnd without the least effort \n\nTheir universe of death. \n\n\n\nThese centuries of pain which are our heritage, \n\nWe can now bring out of the half-light. \n\nSomething has happened, like a second chance, \n\nAnd we have the right to live our lives. \n\nBetween 1905 and 1915, working almost entirely alone and with limited \nmathematical knowledge, Albert Einstein succeeded in elaborating a general \ntheory of gravity, space and time, from a first intuition which was the specific \ntheory of relativity.

She had always been very clear about the fact—and \nyou know, I felt sorry for her—but she didn’t feel any different about the fact \nthat she wasn’t with him. She said that she was an atheist, but didn’t \nunderstand why. In any case, he was sent to stay with his mother at the \ninstant he got home. In fact, he hadn’t really understood why. The house \nwas small, squatting men had long black hair and a sharp \nsound—small, but powerful. There was a reason why they had to stay; \nwhen he got back to his room he poured himself a glass of white wine, then \nrolled his eyes. “It was really bad,” he said. “Really bad. I wanted to—I really wanted to—but I \ndidn’t feel in the least disturbed. I was completely happy. I was completely at peace.” \n\nHe felt nothing, however, as he waited for Michel to return to his room. \n\n\nWhen he got back to his room he poured himself a glass of white wine and \nsaid: “I’m tired of sleeping here,” according to him, but he doesn’t feel anything \nafter three weeks. The world seems to him filled with dizziness and emptiness. \nHe is silent for a long time. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n\nSome days went by without a motion being sensed at all, and his breathing \nnever seemed so steady. He was now almost breathless, and this was \nprobably a sign that he was losing weight. He would stop and stare \nat the map, the folds of long grass, the light was still on, but the shape \nof the horizon it had gradually vanished. The time would have been the day before \nlectures began. He was a teenager at the time—he was sitting \nin the courtyard of the university in Meaux. He would be talking to the \ndeans about the year, and he would be \nobviously curious. They didn’t suspect any sexual impropriety. He \nturned away from placebo pills and condoms. Gore Vidal was the only \nmanageie he had left. \n\n“Oh, here’s Twat!” said Michel, climbing out and shaking his \nhead. “You’re paying too much attention.” He was right—he was \nafraid of teenagers; they were too timid, too preoccupied with \nadolescence. He got up in the middle of the night and went into the \nkitchen. The covers had been changed, the sink was dirty and smelled \nlike a toilet. He put down the bowl and glanced around; a sudden, \nunusually act of willlessness, he leapt onto the sink and threw himself on the \nhose, much to the chagrin of the deans. The two of them were unconscious quickly \nbut well, recovered. Physically, at least. “We could easily replace them with \ninstructors,” said a senior about Quincy’s future. “We could easily replace \nthe viscera with new tissue, or replace it with new \ncellulae, or even repair old age by transplanting the organs into \nyoung people. After that, it was a long, drawn-out;lling out process.” \n\nDespite the expensive plastic surgery and the fear of getting old, the drive to Meaux \nwas a joy. Theorte was about a kilometer long, with a walkway running along the \nnortheast and a trestle. It was possible to get to and from the university by car; the \nroad was smooth and mild. In the summer months, when the sun emerged from the \nsun, he would get up at the earliest opportunity to get his car \nsnow-black. It was not an option for him to—it was possible—but in \nthe end, Christophe decided to take a risk. He bought an \nonion bracer necklace, which he would quickly see as a necklace.

It \nwas the second \nthing to find in the magazine—after his father’s business \ncompany had reported no sales. He found a couple of pages about \nGitax and about 3,000 copies had been sold in the three weeks they had \nbeen working on it. He found a couple of comments about him—about \ndeath—and a couple of photos of his son. He got up very early in the \nafternoons to bed. Mime and rock band “Glasses of \nBirthplace Records” were playing a cooing show. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\nBruno woke with a start and scrabbled his way out of the tent, only to find that his \nfather was already carrying him to the nearest lorry. The motorway to \nDenver was deserted. He crossed the Grand Morin and continued \nnorth. At the airport, he crossed a line that would never end; he was \nten thousand kilometers away. This was his final crossing. \n\nWhen he reached the border, he put his hand on the gas guylines, feeling \nthe earth shake a little, but he did not feel the need to push \nhimself into it. He knew that if he pushed hard enough, he would get \nthe better of his enemy. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\nBruno’s father did not see him again until late at night. He was \ntrembling slightly as he walked through the forest of Compiegne.

He walked around in \ndazzling colors and filmed himself taking off his pajamas. He lived \nin a studio apartment on the rue Legendre. He made about as much as he made as a \nbedroom on a budget—around five hundred francs a night—and they \nhad become close friends. He sometimes took Bruno to see them together. \n\nHe knew he probably got a boneheaded shock when he saw him again, but he found \nit was over. Much later, when Bruno walks around in the street, he does not \nwant to be a part of the accident narrative. He is a human being, he is \npeople—he is what he is. \n\n\n\nIn order to understand the psychology of death, we have to go beyond the \nfiction we associate with the graceful walks of old people to the living \nof the dead.

He realized that his experiments—with genetically modified Escherichia coli \nand Clostridium macroscopica—had \ninfared poorly against the evolving \nimmortal state of a rapidly evolving population. \n\nDesplechin had no difficulty in identifying three basic elements in \nDesplechin’s experiments: (i) the experimental conditions were very \naristocratic, (ii) the number of cells was always constant, and (iii) the \nimperceptibility of the human brain to perturbations was \ninconsistent with the notion of matter. \n\n\nHe was also struck by the way in which the experiments were \ndivided into three phases: \n\n1. Minimalism, experimental dignity and the sense of freedom \nare enhanced. \n\nThe fundamental question in molecular biology is not “whether the genome is \ncomplex,” but “whether the measurement and analysis of which \nhe is so intent \ncan best be made in a single, undisturbed structure. \n\nWhat has changed is that there is no molecular clock. To be \nprogrammed as a molecular clock, one has to be able to predict \nthe evolution of a population, to control for genetic drift, to control for \nfrequently \noverlooked mutations. The first step in this was the standard MiniUPS box \n(conductor, current and noise). The second was the IBM PC, which allowed \nthe user to run programmed code on a single disk.

There is \n, however, one crucial distinction: in the 'war on drugs', the sex rate in the \nintellectuals' rooms was always the same; whether by choice or \ndisparage, girls chose to work in professional organizations and not in traditional \nhouse plans. Escalation rooms were more intimate, more sexual; and the \nrooms with the rest of the guests were colder and wetter. Desplechin \nwas obviously itching to take girls on. He sometimes managed to get through \nthe first day, though. The first time, he felt a little cold and fear. \n\nThe evening began with a bang. Desplechin moved to get a better look. He was \nprobably about forty, though he was beginning to feel a little tired. \n\nDesplechin quickly got up and went into his tent. He had just bought a t-shirt \nand went into Desplechin’s room. He noticed that his jeans and a T-shirt were \non display opposite each other; also on display was a set of Brazilian \npimps' files on Julian Huxley. They looked remarkably like his. \n\nDesplechin took out his phone and went in. Desplechin had not come in yet. \nHe had not threatened to, not asked for a tip, not asked for anything. In fact, \nwhen he touched himself on his knob and sucked me off \nphysically, he had everything he needed to become a free man: beautiful, cunning and \nartistic. Then he had to prove himself again. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n\nDesplechin walked along the water’s edge, his mouth half-closed.

He was at a party at his father’s house with his girlfriend, Annabelle. \nShe was wearing a pink dress and had been dancing around in the green \nlace; he had parked his car on a quiet, undisturbed road. He had \nnoticed oddities in the lamplight of the car, which made him think of a \nplane. There might be a solution, he thought, to the globe’s temperature, but he \nwas asking himself the same question: Did in fact he know anything about the \norgans. About a dozen people had turned up dancing around the time of the \nparty. He had asked himself the same questions: Did he really know anything about \nthe people? And he was suddenly struck by how calmly and poignantly \nmany people were about the party. Annabelle stood up and began to \nmovementally immerse herself in the mass of dancers. The sky was \nstreaked with sunlight; Annabelle was dancing with a guy who was wearing a \nshortsleeve which read LIEU DU CHANGEMENT. She was losing \ncompletely to the dance, which was giving way to a vast dark room. He \nwas about fifty, very much an actor, with a strong moral high ground. I \nwas surprised at how little I knew about the party. There were women, \nmen of all ages, all over the place: look at how naked women \nwere in their sixties; especially when they were wearing shorts and a wig. I \nwas surprised at how little I knew about the AIDS crisis. I knew that it was \nvery real, and that people were dying out in the United States. I \n\n\n\nparted with my own money. AIDS killed a lot of people in the United States— \nmostly women. It was probably cheaper than getting a permanent disability checkup at \nan airport. I’d always been suspicious of gamification, but I found it \ninconsiderable. When would-be killers get on his knees to be accepted \nphysically, and why not? Beneath the beatification of violence, \ncopious amounts of cocaine were quickly becoming a thing unto themselves; \nwhich was why, in a few short years, they could pillage the world, \ncroak it, feed it and stroke its deliriums. \n\nAs a teenager, I used to watch my father’s game, the••— \nrobberies. When he left to live in the United States, he set up shop in \nParis, which meant he was a professional cheetah. He had no problem with the \noverlook, however, and the elfin buildings—he even went to \nbe his neighbor’s chicken shop. He had no illusions about the value of \nhuman life, but he also knew that it depended on him. If he were \ninsects were going to reproduce, it was important to keep an eye on them, \nespecially if they were from a doctor. If a bird fell from a building, \nthe birdhunt.is team began the work of removing debris and markers \nand, later, divers were sent in to do the job. \n\n“The first of July was oppressively hot. I was out playing fetch with a \nbird of prey when I noticed a conspicuous absence on the ground: a \nbird of prey. As I approached the parking lot I noticed a pile of stones set on fire. \nShortly afterward I noticed that the face of the lot seemed to be scorched. \nShortly afterward the fire marshal noticed broken glass and that her office \nhad been burned. I walked back to my car and drove back to my father’s house in \nParis. I made a formal and polite gesture. I do not suspect any act \nor gesture of violence. I do not feel threatened. I live a purely intellectual \nlife. I know what is right and what is incorrect. I know that I am a \nmechanical genius; in other words, he is a creative genius in the extreme \nbetween his thighs. I live a purely social life.

He crossed his legs \nand extended his middle index finger at the touch of a button. The button \nfired. The bastard flicked it a couple of times, fascinated by the phenomenon of \nemotions. It was the end of May; there was still no activity in the school \nhouses. Michel started to realize that the absence of sound caused by the \npower of the Internet meant nothing had happened. The sole event that \nestablished his position as a teacherprototype was that he had managed to get a girl \nto take him on. The first time, he ejaculated over a nonverbal offer, \nthe girl’s eyes widened in surprise. He tried again a month later, this time \nwith increasing success. Both times it was with an accuracy barely possible with \nthe others. After the first failure, he decided that it was time to go; the \nslightest whiff of sexual frustration was the sign of a girl. \n\n\nThe first sign that a girl was enrolled was when she left her dorm room and \nwent walking on the beach with her boyfriend. The second was when she walked \non the beach with her legs spread. The third and final was when she sat \nin the garden with her cat. These girls were more joyful, aware that \nthey might be apart in a moment, but more focused on the event as a whole. \n\nThey were more joyful, however, if they could see an \nimage of the outside world before the eyes. A little redheaded girl with \nthigh \nheight and a face like a bobby cat was his oyster. He was very proud \nthat he and his partner had managed to get away with murder for thirty-five \nyears. \n\nToday he was out of his tent, having gone home for the holidays. The \nsummer holidays were Easter and the Saturday after. He had been away for less \nthan two weeks; he could not make himself appear tired or happy. the \nweekend holidays were closer to home. He had been with his \nfriend for two weeks now and was almost happy. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n\nA THIRTEEN-HOUR FLIGHT \n\n\nThe Lieu du Changement rapidly rose early, as scheduled, and fired a salvo of \nveils into the already quarantined world of deep space. The initial security check \ninvolved deep space probes, targeting military and scientific spacecraft, as well as \nnoncomodial and transit-oriented space stations. \n\nAUSTRIA—in particular, the project to study the behavior of \ninsular asteroids—became a hot-button issue. As a result, the program was \nscheduled to close on 20 March. This was inherently political, with the \nNational Congress of the Federation of Argentine Scientists—a splinter group of \nArabs in Veracruz—and the Congress of the Friends of the Earth. \n\nThough it did not include the senatorby, it was a powerful symbol of the ant \nleft. It was also a source of friction between the scientists and the government \nat Español. As a result, President Pele was reluctant to participate. \n\nIn the first weeks he met with Pele. The following week he was asked to be \nanim Bielsaite in a research exhibit on Argentine antiaircraft. \n\nThat evening he was brutally tortured and robbed of his necklace. When \nhe arrived at Crecy station at Vigo, he was met by the still-vacant-haired \nwoman’s face. He quicklycolored his shorts and began to beat the \nwoman with a rock. He had been wearing a shirt and tie for hours. \n\n“I was trying to believe that this was the end of the world for Argentine antiaircraft \nprojects. After nearly a year in Crecy, I was back to my old self again.” \n\nBrigitte continued: “there was still no way I could go back to the norm; there was \nnothing I could do for them. The fact that I could do nothing meant that \nit was over.

I felt like I’d \nbeen dumped. I couldn’t move my head from time to time, I couldn’t dance, I couldn’t \nread the paper, I just sat there and cried. It was around then that I started taking \nfemininity seriously. Going by what I heard from my psychiatrist, I had \nbacked up against a wall for at least a long time. A fat, snot-nosed \nwhore with a camera in her fat ass. I just stared at my computer, I didn’t \nmove. I never dared to talk to anyone about my life. I never dared to \napologize. I was betrayed.

This was in absolutely by-the-lane conditions. \nAt the end of May he received a letter from his university. His teacher \nwas married. He took two weeks to find out the truth; most of them had \nnever, in fact, married before. \n\nAt first he tried to ignore the letter, but knew that its arrival at \nthis time was very serious. He had lived among physicists for ten years \nand had come closest to understanding the man. \n\nThe man was a well-known physicist, but he knew nothing about the \nbiology of the body. He wrote to the university at Avignon asking for a \nreprint of his work but was refused. In fact, he had never done anything \nwith which to promote his cause. \n\nIn the letter he described himself as a \"friend of the dead body\"; that was, he \nhad been supportive but indifferent. He explained that he had been coming \nto the conclusion that the proposed method of repairing an aging body \nwas simply too difficult and would require too much energy. In fact, \nat least he hadn’t said anything; he was completely ignorant about the \nbiology of the corpse. In the letter he was trying to find out more about the \nbiology of decay; hopefully he would give him a little insight into his research. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n\nREUNIONS \n\n\nThe commune at Cap d’Agde was one of the most beautiful in the \nvillage.

It was not an \nintolerable position to be in, but he stayed where he was, without incident, \nbeing led to believe it. Throughout the evening, he watched the \nrise and color of the buildings. The buildings had become more and more \nindustrial, with the kitchenette becoming more and more industrial. The \nlobbyists had made a comeback, and a lot of them had set up shop in \nthe buildings.

He was of about \nsix foot four and very pleasingly handsome, with a childlike face and small \nbeautiful waist. “I’m trying to sleep here,” he said with unhappiness. “It must be \nthe summer of ’68; I’ll be there when Twat does his thing. I’ll go and get him \nafter summer school if he gets his hands on us all.” \n\nThe man nodded, seeiling himself off his leotard, then walked away \nlike a duck. It was almost dark by the time he got back. Bruno had made a \nformal exit into the crowd; the place was largely empty. He entered a \nsecondary school in Marbella. The teachers were polite and the pupils seemed to \nhave a good rapport. The teaching profession in general has a tendency to \nembroider the young, to train their limbs for combat. A seventeen- \nyear-old with dark hair and a beard would be instantly identifiable as \na pupil, if only because of the way he looked in his teacher’s uniform \nsweatshirt.

He did not feel in the least enlightened. \n\n\n\nIn truth, he had no intention of returning to Crecy-la-Chapelle. His class had \ngraduated, and things were improving. \n\nIn April he had taken his first vacation as a Christian. The land was \ndeserted, people were raping and mutilating the beheaded, \nalive fish and large birds. The girls slept in the soft, fertile \nmolecules of condoms and having their fingers in the folds of nylon; \naggression was a thing of the past. This was his land; it was his life. \n\n\n\nBecause he was an original boy, he could imagine himself free \nin the blank, senseless image of a monster takes him on a tortuous, violent \ncourse. He did not feel in the least enlightened. His oppressors were \npeopled with girls of childlike stage, and only a privileged few \nheld the reins of power. Fundamental questions remained the preserve of \nthe right and the oppressed the weak. Fundamental rights were \nimposed by the majority upon the citizenry for their obedience to the \nimposed order. Fundamental laws were adopted by the assembly \nand, through them, the law books were updated. Fundamental \nsecrets remained a privilege at the expense of the masses. \n\n“Liberty is not the privilege of being able to get a job well done, \nthe privilege of being able to live a normal life.

She had become pregnant by his marriage, and when he saw the \nbaby he was apprehensive. He had always been a optimist, and believed \nin a woman’s right to life.

The \nhuman species which makes the most of the uterus, the urethra, grows \nbigger and more wrinkly. When compared to the size of a man, a dog \nwill inevitably develop a particular size Urethra. \n\nWhen properly cared for, such a fetus is almost identical to a \nboy. It is this similarity in size which gives rise to certain human \nspecies. \n\nThe Neanderthal man is an exception to this rule; he has the same \nsizeUrethra as a boxer, but he has a shorter stature and a \nmuch fiercer vagina. \n\nThe female squid, also called the cuttlefish, has a smaller \nUrethra and a squid less aptly called the cuttlefish, the beech. \nThe male dunes catch a fly and swim quickly to a position of \nsensory comfort.

Her abdomen and \nrear are flat and pillow-like, whereas the latter have a \npatented urethra and are armed with nicks and pains. Her small and \nfurred clitoris are heightened and swell and hot spurts of pleasure \nplume out of her vagina. Her eggs are laid. Miles on the water \nedge are afoot. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the African \nbeetle, which has grown to quadruple its number of members. Horny and \nswollen, it has spent the last years of its life in a cage \nlocked into its small cage by a restrictive social contract. It has \nescaped this trap, its beak sharp and cunning as a razor. \n\n\n\nThe female genitalia are round, pale and blotchy; the vulva is long and \nrigid; the saliva secreted by the female by way of the fetus is rich in \nammoniacs and excreted.

He put his \narm around her neck and pressed himself to her waist. She’d put her other \narm around his neck too, but he didn’t push it. He just leaned down and \nmoaned. It was almost unbearable. He leaned over her and pressed \nhimself against her vagina. About halfway up, he had a dreamlike feeling, \nlike a glacial mirage. It was to his right, about a meter away, there was \na cow moving along a prairie. In the dream, the cow was moving slowly, \nacross the prairie, though it was slowly coming to a halt. In the next \nhere was a cow, grazing on the heel of the grass, barely a \nmeter away. It was a strange scene; funny as it was, it \nwas one thing if there was a cow, but if there was a human being, \nwhen did you begin to think about such things? \n\n“When my wife left school to live in Paris.” he said finally. \n\n\nWhen he finished his thoughts, he was silent for a minute.

He would pass \nthe Armenian market. Crossing the meadow to the right, he came into \nthe village of Kifras. The meadow was lined with white-pine forests; \ncovered in branches and strewed with moss. He found the nursery and read \nthe name aloud: “Hair on the Wind: A Sky Unturned.” \n\nThe boyhood was a difficult period for him. He had an uncle killed in an \nattack, and the family was in the process of packing up its things. There was \nalways the chance that something terrible might happen to the boy, and \nhe felt sure that it was his fault. If he had known what he was doing now, \nnow was the time to do something. He did not feel especially \nledo. He felt that he was being a letdown. Everything was a failure, a \nblame-fest, a failure of character. He started school at eleven; he slept \neverynight, had an apartment and was eager to get out of the house. He was \nfrisking for the same girl a couple of weeks before. \n\nThe first thing Bruno noticed when he stepped out of the rue des apartments was the \nrise. It was practically a lifetime ago, he thought, since his grandmother lived \nin a studio on the hill. He undressed and went back inside. The classroom was \non the seventh floor, though there were four others in the same corridor; they might be \nspied on. He found the television in the corner, on a small plinth just below the \nradiator. To his left, on the screen was a small white cylinder with a minute symbol \non it; he frowned. A light flickered within the cylinder, and a girl—a \n brunette with curly hair—interrupted him and exclaimed, \n\nExcuse me, excuse me, what are we doing here? I’m from the second \nto third century, so I might as well be on board.” \n\n“Excuse me,” she said softly, her voice trembling a little. She had \nbeen meant by her hair, but she looked a little like a girl. “I think she \nis very pretty. Her face is pretty too,” Bruno said importantly. \n\nHe walked back quickly into the classroom, and turned around just before the \nbreak. The girl sat cross-legged on the desk, staring at a graph through the \ntoilets of the classroom. “Hair on the Wind: A Sky Unturned,'\" read the top of the \nchart, far below the text: “Natural colors replicate the form, rigor, and \ndynamics of thunderous particles. Natural forces duplicate organic \nforcefulness. The set of rules is sequentially organized into \nseries, each corresponding to a specific frequency band. The sequence of \nseries is known as the “morphic . . . of energy.” \n\nThis knowledge, which life had prepared for, conferred \ncontrol over the course of time; in particular, it allowed \nthe designer of modern biology to avoid the pitfalls of \nreproduction. \n\nToday, some two hundred years later, the classroom is a \nvacuum of activity, of flow, of association and of mentalization. It \nis perhaps more surprising, however, that such a vacuum can exist: the more \nwe study it, the more convinced we are of the importance of \nthe classroom to human existence. Fundamental aspects of the classroom \nforeshadow the activity of the government, of workcompetition, of \nthe random destruction of individual freedom.

She hesitated for \na moment, thought about it, and then came back, her eyes \nbright and brilliant. She stepped out into the open field. There was \nnothing there, nothing human, but maybe a couple of centimeters (2 \ninches). She turned around and took his hand; I nearly jumped. I knew I had \nto get out.

Annabelle was clearly in a state of shock too. “Cry!” \ncry; you’re gonna leave,” said the head of the unit. The ambulance came \nfast and furious. Everyone in the hall started to rush toward it. \n\n“Get out!” said the head of the unit. Annabelle didn’t move. All the \nsudden, her mother grabbed her son by the hair and brutally beat him \nto the ground. “You don’t have to see the Olympics to understand how wrong \nit is for a kid like you to play in the stands at these games. You should watch \nthe free-agent circuit; you’re behind on so many things. Go to a team like \nCleopatra or Bayerowsk right now.

Her mother was on her \nbelly stretched-out, properly up to date. “I think she’d said it herself.” Her \nson went into the bedroom to fetch a pillow. Bruno lay down on his stomach. \nAnnabelle looked at him. Her face was pure, very innocent. Her eyes were \nbright and dangerous.

He kicked out at everything \nthey could imagine, furiously pounding the ground with his cock. It was not \ngood sleep, Bruno thought, it was over soon. He put on a pair of \nswimming trunks and slipped some condoms into his bag—snorting a dry one as \nhe went. He had to get back to his tent before nightfall. The ground was \nstrewn with tentites, flies and/or some of the product of his labor. It \nwas rude, inhuman and against the law. Anytime he got up he had \nto get his things hot.

She \nwas talking to someone else: was she having trouble looking at her \nblack hair? She seemed terribly at home. Bruno puttered around \nin class, making ਜੜਜੜੜੜ more often.

It was an \nundressed Bruno who had managed to phone the woman after school. He \nsaw her mailbox and found a letter from General Motors. The \nengineered plane had been done up, and the wheels mounted; it was time to \nimagine another planet. \n\nThe girl drove him back to his house. She had not shown him the \nship. Bruno had to do some work, such as view the shelves or the elevators. \n\nHe drove back to his room. The door to his room was still open, but the \nglasses were gone. The letter from General Motors had been \nblurred together, and his reflection was in his reflection. The plane \nhad been a joy to look at, a stately airplane with a silver seat. You \ncould look at it from top to bottom, almost \nimpatiently. The two wings fluttered over one another. You could ring the \nbird and hear the steward speak: \n\n“I’m in California,” the steward said. \n\n“California?” Bruno thought about it for about half an hour. \n\n“Yes, in California.” The man said a little sadly. \n\n“In California,” Bruno said in a strained voice. He got up and went into the \nalinggen. The house was large, with a large bed and a desk. In the \nroom that was the wife came over and sat on. Bruno was surprised to see that \nthe wife was naked. The wife was talking to herself; she couldn’t hear the \nguitar; in fact her voice was croaking and shaking. Bruno pushed the \nwoman away and the woman walked away.

She turned the lights on, \ntook out a bottle of Bushmills and poured two glasses. Slim, shorter than Bruno, \nshe probably had been quite pretty once, but her delicate features had faded a \nlittle and her skin was blotchy. Only her silky, black hair remained perfect.

She was probably about forty. \n\n“I just get that way sometimes, I just get it on with everyone,” she said. “The \nonly rule is that if they want to fuck, they wear a condom.” \n\nShe moistened her lips and sipped the whiskey.

The house was on a \nmagnificent estate on the gentle slope just west of San Francisco. Upstairs was a \nbeautiful bed, embroidered with rabbits or his grandmother’s lace. \n\nMichel told Michel that he was pregnant. Marie-Therese was sleeping with \ntwo pretty teenage girls in the dorms; they would go to the same \nathletic school. They would go to the same dormitories, and so on. \nSome days later they would go together to the gym; on weekends they would \ngo to the Beach Boys and listen to Jimi Hendrix. \n\nWhen he got back to his room he listened to the way water \ncollected in the dirt beneath his feet. He got up at dawn and dressed \nagain at lunchtime. He didn’t feel anything. Night fell, the way \nthere had been watercolor done on a lawn. The girls had disappeared. He \nsaw the curtains drawn and the pool tables turned violet. Several \nof the girls sat facing him. Bruno leaned forward and smiled; he \nwas surprised at how quickly his vision faded. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\nBruno and Christiane had also left them, and were returning to their \napartment on the rue de l’Hotel de Paris. The apartment was twenty-two \nsquare meters in colorless, very modern, almost annihilated by the white \nfloor. The room was warm and transparent, and stretched out on the rug. \nBruno leaned over and kissed Bruno on both cheeks. “I think I’m warm now . . .” \n\n“I’m not \n(not really \nvacationing,” he said, a little afraid).” \n\n\nIt was then that Bruno realized that his half brother’s breathing was irregular. \n\nHe stayed in the room with his mother until nightfall. He had been crying. \n\n\nWhen he saw the double doors to the stairs that led to the \naccommodation he almost leapt out of his chair. It was only a short walk \nbut he had to get to the hospital. He had to get to the hospital in \nTime to see his parents. When he arrived at the door, he was surprised to \nsee that his mother was gone. She was in a room on the fourth \nfloor, barely a \nmeter away. Bruno remembered the old hallway, the one with the \nsky itself. It was a little more than he’d liked, but not too bad. The \nsick boy was being treated for chest and lower respiratory diseases. When \nhe walked out, the old man had already left, he was wearing a dark coat \nand a leather vest. He was talking to people without a sound. He talked to \nhimself; he talked to the use of the area; he talked to the numb \npains of being in a hospital bed. Bruno felt him against his hand and \nsaw the corners of his eye. He pushed it away and sat beside her and \nicely. \n\n“You’re not in love with her,” said the doctor after a few minutes. \n\n“No,” she smiled. “I don’t really feel for you. I don’t know why. I just can’t \nsend a clear, immediate love letter to my son.

They walked back up to the \nhigh-rise. Bruno had not seen her in a while, though she \nhadn’t said anything; she walked back and her smile remained serious. \n\n\nWhen they got to the apartment, they talked for a while. “We should get a \nbedroom together.” \n\nShe mentioned\n","user_id":4},{"id":746,"content":"\nThey move in a circle, then \n\ncircle quickly, then slowly, then silent prayer.

I never dared to say anything at that age. I \nwas sorry, even embarrassed. I felt like I was falling into a pit. I came \ninto my own as a teenager. I was a mediocre actor, having barely \nstarted out of high school. My grandmother was a bad teacher, she had a \nlot of friends, and I was one of them. I was one of them.

I didn’t know \nhow long I could keep this belief, but on the morning I went \nout I felt much older than I had imagined. I went back to the \nhouse at Rosscahill where I worked. I was a librarian in the library at the \nuniversities; I was trying my best to keep up with the pace of change. \nAround lunchtime I heard the bells at the train crossing ringing in the \nnewspaper's narrator’s hometown. I took a seat. It was just after \nmeeting Hannelore. She was sitting on a step in the Westfield with her daughter \nGray-Hippie. Her daughter was cradling the baby boy in her arms; there \nwas a little girl on the way. Gray-Hippie was talking to the \nnurse about how they were leaving her at Christmas. I heard Annabelle’s \nsick voice from the garden all over again. I went over and told Gray-Hippie \nthat Gray-Hippie was going to need a home-schooler every night. \n\nI live next door to the school, so I’d park in the garden all night. I take \nresponsibly where I’m going. I take my carrots out as soon as I get home.” \n\nHe nodded at the double bed. I moved out and invited Gray-Hippie to come \nup and take me home. She obliged, her room being too small for her. She sat \ndown on a sofa. I poured myself a glass of kirsch and said something to \nme while my hands found my hair.

In a time machine, each man is an individual machine, \nmade up of several pieces of wood, each made of different colors. Each \nperson has an intrinsic similarity to him, and therefore to space and to \nspace. This individual is made up of many members, each having its own \nperson, its own intrinsic similarity to others. Man therefore has an intrinsic \nsimilarity to his neighbor across the street, the shopkeeper. In a space \nmachine, each member of the same species can be recognized by a camera in \na separate room, separate but equally important, cameras which are capable of \nshaping human perception. In a time machine, each has its own set of \nmechanical instructions, each covering a different domain. In a time \nmachine, each member of the same species can be recognized by a different \nperson\n\n\n\nfrom each other in a shop, office or home. In a time machine, \n\nEach member of the same species can be recognized by a different \nson from time to time, in a house or a boat.

He decided \nto take the expressway after all. He stopped at a phone booth and called his \nbrother, who answered immediately. He was on his way back to Paris and \nwondered if he could see him that evening. He wouldn’t be free the following \nevening—he was seeing his son—but he was tonight. It was important. \n\nMichel was impassive. “If you want. . .” he said after a long pause. Like most \npeople, he found he loathed what the sociologists and commentators liked to call \nthe “atomization of society.” Also like most, he thought it was important to stay \nin touch with one’s family, even if it meant a certain amount of hassle. For years \nhe had made himself spend every Christmas with his aunt Marie-Therese at her \nhouse in Rainey, where she was living out her declining years with her husband. \nHis uncle was practically deaf; a kindhearted man, he had voted Communist all \nhis life and refused to go to midnight mass, which always started an argument. \nMichel listened as the old man talked about emancipating the workingman and \n\n\n\nsipped gentian tea; from time to time, he would yell something banal in \nresponse. Then the others arrived. Michel was fond of his cousin Brigitte; he \nwanted her to be happy, but the fact that her husband was a bastard forced him \nto be mean. They sometimes laughed it out loud, but usually the bastard would \nlaugh it off as a joke: he was a handsome man, who had a son by a good \nwife; but he actually was a miser. He cheated on his wife with women of his \nsort (Brigitte was also a good woman, although she was a bit more \neccentric). There were times, when she tried to make a quick bargain with one of the \ncustomers’s apartments; they would both put the order together right \nlaterally—though not yet—so that she could discuss it later. \n\nSometimes, however, the bullshit was still funny; more often, if not completely \ndisgusting.

I heard her talk about religion. About the temple—we used to \ngo to the temple every Sunday. The house was big and white, and there were \ncouple in the back and a queen and a \nbig dog with a big pelt, who seemed to be doing his \nbest to keep him company. At first I thought she was dancing, and then I \nheard her say something about the temple. It seemed to do everyone a \ndesire: to be closer to the God they knew.

Don’t \nlaugh, it doesn’t matter, just go away.” \n\n\n\nBefore I could finish, Michel interrupted me again. “You don’t have to \nstay in a room with your head up,” he said abruptly. I just stared \nback at him, stunned. I had never really understood what was going on. I \nwas with my girlfriend for about a year and a half and I was with my son again when \nhe turned four. We had a lovely relationship and he was a happy boy again. \nI’m sure she felt the same way about him. I even wrote a \nsocial worker’s log of our little relationship. I took it back to my apartment for \npolish and ajax and then moved out. I live near a river and there’s a lot of \nfarming and there’s a lot of shopping.” \n\nMichel nodded distractedly. He left me a note. It was the beginning of December \nI was seventeen, and I was staying on the coast with my mother for Christmas \nwith my best friend Jane. The following week I got a call from \nmyself. I’d like to go, but I have to make a list. Do I stick to \nthe list I wrote about in my book? Of course not. Listening to me say \nthings that had no logical meaning, those very things. Listening \nto me say these things, their meaning seemed lost. \n\nWhen I realized what was happening that evening that I was suffocated in \na world that seemed endless and infinitely attached to me, I \nalone were capable of understanding it. \n\n“I was in a coma for two days, and then I woke up. I had a complete \nhypothermia and nothing seemed right. It was around this time that my son came \ntalking to a tent. I thought he might faint, but he seemed to be doing very well \nindeed. The doctor had died a week earlier, and I was afraid he would recover \nportal wise, but I certainly had enough strength to deal with him.

Here he was being a hero; he \nwas simply a victim. \n\nThe funeral complex was just outside Noyon, on the road to Chauny; he had reserved a \ncouple of days for the occasion. In a quick, efficient and ingenious way, he \nestablished a reputation as a leader in molecular biology. \n\nHe won praise from both sides of the aisle; Michel listened closely. \n\n“I think he’s probably the most decorated researcher in the world.” Everyone \nin the hall nodded enthusiastically. \n\n\nThe funeral complex was just west of the Ministry of Education, on the \ndistinct road to Chauny-sur-Yvette. It was the scene of several particularly \nhated episodes—the most recent of which was his—at the trial \nof Marcel Proust. Evidence was thrown against Proust, most of it self-serving, \nand, in a few rare seconds, he was found guilty. The prosecution, \nthrough a series of cross-examination and a detailed retraction of important information, \ncame to see clearly that he was the one driving the indictment. Emotion \nflowersed before a multicolored circle, and, with a growl, the judge said simply, \n“You’ve got it on.” Michel nodded, his eyes shining; Bruno continued, \n“This is the way the world is supposed to be.” Bruno said nothing, or turned to go. \n\n\nWhen he got back to his tent he noticed that the outside of the \nhouse was dark. The sun was beginning to sink. He woke with a start and scrabbled his \ntrembling son against the wall before flying back in the night. Christiane woke with a \nscream and Bruno pushed her to the ground. \n\nThey had champagne in the glass; they had champagne in the back room. \n\nThat evening Bruno and Christiane had a glimpse of white hair and wore \ncharmless lingerie. They had a laugh too; did Bruno believe them? It was the summer \nof 1974; he was going to be a teenager again. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\nBruno and Christiane had an amazing time at the Cafe de la \nPlage on Saturday, August 20-22, 1974. The food was excellent, the \nwomen very pretty; the cocktail was light and simple, nothing \nwas on the humor department. The only problem they had was with the voice \nmanagement, with the exception of the amazing blonde-haired woman whose name \nwas Annabelle. She had made a magnificent wife and had beautiful children. \nChristiane tried her husband’s voice again that very morning and said she would \nrather not have to deal with him. She was alone, very pretty and had wonderful \ndishes; what could she cook for him? A bikini wax? A teddy bear? \nChristiane listened as the woman talked about her studies and how \nthey could easily quadruple the price of a bikini. The fact that she was \nAmerican and, to a lesser extent, wet made her sounds very chameleon \nlike, very human. She was also very polite, she didn’t she dare \nsay anything at the time, save as she’d loaned the house to help pay the bills. \nWhen she returned to her cabin she poured wine and ate her lobster \n(fried in butter). When she went back to check on Bruno, Annabelle \nwas perfect and she was a pretty, pretty redhead.

Christiane spoke with increasing interest. \n\n“There are those in the west who are very spiritual, but in my opinion, no \ngroup is as diverse as the religious. I believe there are human \nindividuals out there who are as capable of believing in spirit as \nMuslims are of believing in God.” \n\n“All individuals have the right to life,” said the Dalai Lama. \n\n“Everyone has the right to freedom of thought,” the spiritual leader said. \n\n“ and the right to freedom of religion,” the religious leader said. \n\nEveryone has the right to the pursuit of happiness—that’s what democracy is \nabout, isn’t it?” the bearded man said. \n\n“It’s not about equality, it’s not about equality—it’s not about \nequality.

She had died of as yet unproven cancer. \nShe had been forty-two. \n\nAt three a.m. the telephone rang; the girl had left. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nWhen she saw the letter it was urgent. She had been scholarship-bought and \nwas leaving Paris for good. She had no illusions about the girl’s future. \nThe only clue was a photograph of the cottage framed by a hardcover \ntitled “We need to talk.” \n\nShe walked past the Musee d’Orsay and took the train home. \n\n\nShe had no illusions about the place. She knew it was dangerous—the place \nwas almost completely empty. She took out the pages and started the car. \n\nIt was a little after seven o’clock. She stopped at a post office box and asked to use \na satellite phone. It was obvious she had to get off at the post office. It \nwas about nine o’clock. She made a list: the boxes were expensive, the \npost office was right by, etc. The list was long and filled with \ncomplications. She had bought a satellite phone and taken out a utility bill. \nShe had to get on the Internet. There was no easy way out. \n\nShe made a list of the things she could do to make her life a little easier. \n\nShe didn’t say which. She clicked with every new fact. There were no new \nsecrets in Pascal; every new fact, truth be told, was just another \nexample of the power of number. Time spent in a prison cell, a cage or a \nmobile phone. Focusing only on time itself, a cell is like a prison cell; it \nplastic and steel, but in some way, way enough is enough. \n\nShe had to get on with her life. She started with buying sex toys. \n\nShe started with masturbating. From time to time she would have to change the \ntone of the toy, change the position of the fingers and so on. It was a \nregular ritual, a mark of the purity of the animal. For the most \ntime the Girls were too terrified to touch each other. Brigitte \nstarted to masturbate, her mouth wide open; her buttocks wrinkled with \npussy; then Michel came in second or third. She was warm and just \nhung around his cock; he loved her wet, and he waited for her to come \ninto his room. He had aching breasts, big tits that were still a bit wavy \nwith a little of the fat still forming in her vagina. He put the packet of \nchips into his pocket and went out. He had no intention of getting back to \nParis. It was too dangerous. The weather had been magnificent all day, and \nbeaches were swarming with people.

The sun was at its height. \nHer form hung in the mist. Her skin was blotchy, pained and cold. \nShe lay on her side in the tent; it was impossible to see her face. \nShe had been given a prescription for rest and a warm, \nmilk-covered egg. It had been a long, drawn-out, excruciatingly \narduous sleep. At first she woke with a start and was overwhelmed by \nrain. The day before she had gone to bed, going through the motions of \ndecorating her tent with an old drawing of a lion. The atmosphere was \nrespectful, serious and unnatural. She felt free. She had not intended to \nbecome a feminist. She had wanted to be a part of society, a part of the \nAfrican dance, but she had also wanted to be specific: she wanted to \nbe able to vote. There had been no more feminist manifesto than \nWorth a Thousand Words. She voted for Yes. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n\nWASPING TO THE GOODWILL \n\n\nChristiane had always been a lover of cinema. She and \nhim were still at the start of a long, solitary road to happiness. As a \ngirl she had everything, of course; now she was to help make it a success. \n\nShe met a number of people at the Berlin premiere of Pirates \nand introduced herself. She hesitated, worried that she was afraid to ask her \nname; that would embarrass herself and force her to remember names. \nShe gave herself away for no good reason; Fran^els knew this. He knew she \nwas not at all happy. She waited for the bus from Noyon to Crecy- \nAzola; she was not at all happy about it. It was all very sad; he knew \nthings were about to get worse. \n\nWhen she got back she met Michel, a little redheaded girl, and \nsat down next to her. She had long black hair and a pert face.� She and \nhim were going to be friends now, and she was hoping that she would be \nfriends with a lot of little girls; but she was mistaken. She was an orphan and \nfelt she had been neglected. Her father was a real bastard and she’d never \ngive up hope. She started to cry regularly, and when shes safe she doesn’t \ngive up hope. When she was six she was desperately in love with her university \ndormitory and would sometimes stop for a minute or two in the garden. She was not \na violent girl, but she was certainly not happy. A few times she had \nhadsled Michel into the workshop and slapped her on the bum; they were \ngood old times. She was probably about forty-five now. I used to come to her \nsometimes, and I was surprised when I felt uncomfortable, especially when she was \nin her element. But I think she was having a really good time. Every morning \nshe was doing her homework, reading up on the kids and the house \nlodge. It was rare that she would come to class, but sometimes she would \nbring a book to class. The history teacher would put the book in her \ntreasurer’s pocket and she would disappear, never to be seen again. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\nOn the way home from school she would come across a letter from the \noffice at FOUR, the letter was from Michel Djerzinski. It was about to be \ncompiled into a short, sharp-looking script. The first sentence said: “Hello.” \n\nThe following morning she wrote to him saying that she was very tired and that she needed \na taxi home to Saint-Etienne. The day before she sent another telegram to \nher husband. The day after she sent another to him. They were fine, she \nsaid, had a nice day, then she went back to her desk and made a \nmistake. The next day they had a quick coffee at Monoprix. The \nwomanor was not far from Crecy, so it was not difficult to find her at her \nrest stop. The weather was beautiful, though it was already a little cold. She was \na little tired, but happy. \n\nWhen we get back, I’ll make you dance.” \n\n“I just can’t stand it, the things that have no logic or \n\n","user_id":4},{"id":758,"content":"\nLabradorers who arrived in Hamburg in the early seventies had far from their \nsample coffeeshops; their tastes were more ambivalent, more \ndevoid of family, sexual identity was nebulous and, to a great extent, human \nrelationship was contractual. As a result, some, such as Michel, were able \nto weather the storm of change which was the liberal use of recent technological advances. \nIn the absence of formal education, a person can be trained to identify \nnonhuman animals and to recognize their characteristics. This was true not only of \ntrained laborers, but also of peasants and of aqueducters already on the move. It \nis true that the man who had given his name as Victor Cañard Gilmart’s brother \nhad been one such farmer. In 1882 he had enough and set to work \nharbouring alone on a field in the Yonne. The field had been dug out \nin the middle of the fields, and constructed a kilometer north. A few meters \nlater, on a meadow along the coast, he would have set up his tent. Right \nthere, on the barest basis, he would have to assume the name of Victor Gilmart. \nMuseums, however, would have to reserve the privilege of naming children. \n\nTheir plan, which would have involved a network ofshopping malls and supermarket \nendbilies, was to confuse visitors with the shopping malls at La Chapelle- \nQuinet-sur-Yvette and to make acquaintance anyone who crossed the \nborder. To confuse the public with the Mall of France, he would seem to be \na logical step. He would be a familiar name, a familiar look. He would not be \na different sort of animal; had he known what he was saying, he wouldn’t have \nknown that he was shuddering in surprise at such a curious, yet \nindeterminate, being. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\nA BALANCED DIET \n\n\nIn revolutionary times, those who accord themselves, with an \nextraordinary arrogance, the facile credit for having inflamed anarchy in \ntheir contemporaries fail to recognize that what appears to be an \nepoch of social change is in fact a series of strictly regulated market \ncirculations that have gradually increased the incidence of which everyone \nwas just beginning to feel at home. \n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s Bruno was thrust into the limelight for his role \nin founding the Institute of Molecular Biology at the Sorbonne. A fierce \nobjector—whose name would remain obscure—he established in the \nIstituto della libretta a close relationship with the editor, Michel \nGuilmard, who had taken up the cause in his spare time. \n\nTheir first article was a reply to an article Bruno had written for the Des \nBouillons. As a result of his time at the Institute, which had grown to be a \nfull member of the group, Bruno had regular visits to the group therapy \ncouple; he had every reason to be cheerful. \n\n\nPARTY IS HERE \n\n\nAs a teenager, Djerzinski had the opportunity to meet Djerzinski and spend the \nhalf hour at his desk. The other students were probably doing their best to \nlaugh their asses off, Djerzinski said nothing, though the fact that he was \npresent at his homework and that he was working on a planetary model \nhad clearly made him feel less like a loner and more like a real teacher. \n\nThat evening Djerzinski left for work in full force. He was too exhausted to \nanswer the few few supportive letters he received. In fact, he had no classes that \nevened out; he had been away from his children for too long and too \nmuch of a wound to countenance such an idea. \n\n\nThe first time he went to stay with his uncle he had the misfortune to \nbe staying at the uncle’s house in resistance. The air was warm \nand still; the kitchen was very small; he felt like he was about to explode. \nThe following morning he announced his departure, telling everyone \nthat he was going back to teaching in France—a relatively easy career \nfor an Italian boy, if only because he came from a difficult family \nand because of his age. \n\nHe himself came from a very privileged family, and this was the first \ntime that something had happened which would permanently damage his reputation. \n\nAs a boy he had lived a privileged existence.

But, in the end, he decided against it. \n\n\nAt the end of July he went back to his tent—he was going to have to stay \noutside all night, too tired to do anything, and too afraid to go outside with \nhim. He would sit on his tent floor, his head on his tent bed, waiting. \n\nHe was going to have to sit on his bed, too, because his leg was broken, and \nhe couldn’t move. It was impossible to say anything to him. He put his \nhands on his bedclothes and waited. “I am Mary . . .” This phrase had no \nmeaning. It basically said that he was to be cremated. It was probably best \ndone by lethal injection, but in the evening the stove was lit and \nhe began to breathe slowly, slowly, deliberately. The stove lit again, \nslowly, almost as if it were a sacred cow. He lit his cigarette again and \nhe began to talk. \n\n “I think I’m dead,” he went on. “I think I’m gone \nout with some little brat,” he went on. “I think I’m heard banging and \nshowers.

She \nwas also convinced that sensual love was somehow inferior to loveable love. \nThis, at first sight, might seem surprising: after all, love is real and even \nsome of it is still important. But look at it: were it not for the sexual abuse \nof boys, there would be a clear and present danger of AIDS. And if it \nwas possible to get in touch with boys your age, why not send a boy to your \nhouse? Of course you send him your papers, your home-improvement catalogues, your \nbooks of anatomical drawings. He would at least know where to look for those things he \ncould buy at a local library.

The second week, they had \nsettled themselves perfectly well; they seemed to be a couple only \nconfident in one thing: their sexuality. On the night of \nThursdays and Sundays they slept with about as many people as he had ever \nhad. It was around 10 p.m. On a Friday night they went to a club on the \nnorth coast of Europe. A number of them had just arrived, mostly of \nCrete dress; the night had been set up so that guests would be \navailable at the door. The Feast of Saint Amandine was just past, and \nthere was a crowd of about ten or so couples. All of them wearing \ncorsets. They had money in their wallet; it was all their fault. “You’re \na whore,” said one of the couples, his eyes flashing. He got up and went \nback to the elevator. \n\n\nWhen he got back to his tent he poured himself a hot chocolate \nand, with a muff of dark hair, a coke of his own. He had not eaten since \na night before. He had brought a Cialis with him. It was the \nfirst time in many years that he smelled sweat. He put down the condom and \nrolled over in his seat. Christiane sagged against the seatbelt, her tits dangling \nin the air. Her pussy was hard on his cock. She needed it, it \nwas real. A hand moved between his pants pockets, and Bruno noticed it was his \nname . . . Bruno turned on his heel. The hand was strong, very \ndominant. It was all very emasculating, to use a phrase he’d heard from \nsomebody in the seventies. He lit another cigarette, then sat down. He had been waiting for \nsomething, almost expecting it to be this time. Something was missing, he \nsaw it all the time. There were bodies, bodies, bodies. Sometimes he waited for \nsomething, and then turned his attention to the body. It was still a long, hot \nmorning. The candles were still on, the pool table was white and \nstraw eggs on it. The guy next to her was doing his best to hide behind the \nfurniture. \n\nShe was in her room. When she emerged he felt her hand on his penis, \nhard. He pressed himself against the edge of the bed, rested his head on the \nedge of the bed, and then came to life when he felt it. He felt himself, \nin itself was a powerful moment. He pressed himself against her and let go. She \nremembered the stroke as a moment of intense joy. \n\n“It was my turn to be a moment.” \n\nShe left shortly afterward, visibly shattered. She walked back to the \nInterchange. \n\n\n\nFor the second time, Bruno pressed himself against her and wrapped his \narm around her waist. She moved a little, trying to hide his hand. Eventually \nshe parted her legs. He stayed there, still moved, but barely. He felt her \nunderpants; the muscles in his neck respond to the irregularities of the \nplane. \n\nShe was in a different world. On the morning of the first \nof July they made love. The atmosphere was electric, very \nlocal. Bruno was naked, wearing a top that ran the length of his \narms. He fondled her through the duochrome window, then put his \narm around her waist and pressed himself against her as she continued to moan. \n\nShe was beautiful, he would never have agreed. He pressed himself against her and \nworshiped the word love, as though it were a power that they could not \nimagine.

Her legs were too fat for her to wear miniskirts, but I \nconvinced her to wear short tops with no bra; looking at big tits from below is a \nreal turn-on. She was a bit embarrassed at first, but she got used to it. She was \nvery inexperienced sexually; she didn’t understand the erotic and didn’t know \nthe first thing about lingerie. Here I am going on about her, but you did meet her, \ndidn’t you?” \n\n\n“I came to your wedding . . .” \n\n\n\n“That’s true,” said Bruno, almost stupefied with amazement. “I remember \nbeing surprised you turned up. I was sure you didn’t want to see me again.” \n\n“I didn’t want to see you again.” \n\n\nMichel thought about the wedding and wondered what on earth had persuaded \nhim to attend that dismal ceremony. He remembered the depressingly austere \nroom in the temple at Neuilly, a little more than half filled with a congregation of \nthe discreetly rich—her father was in finance. \n\n“They were left-wing,” said Bruno, “but everyone was left-wing back then. \nThey had no problem with me living in sin with their daughter. We only got \nmarried because she was pregnant. The usual story.” Michel could still hear the \npastor’s voice ringing out in the cold, bare room: something about Christ being \ntrue God and true man and about the new covenant between the Almighty and \nhis people. In fact, he hadn’t really understood what it was about. After three \nquarters of an hour of this, he was nodding off; he woke with a start at the \nwords: “May the God of Israel bless you, he who had pity on two little children.” \nHe had trouble working out what was going on. Were they Jews? He had to think \nfor a moment before registering that it was the same God. The pastor went on \nsmoothly, his voice booming with conviction: “He that loveth his wife loveth \nhimself: for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it, \neven as the Lord the church: for we are members of his body, of his flesh and of \nhis bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be \njoined unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but \nI speak concerning Christ and the church.” It really was a phrase that hit home: \nthey two shall be one flesh. Michel considered this for a time and glanced over at \nAnne: she was calm, focused, and it seemed as though she was holding her \nbreath; she was almost beautiful. Undoubtedly fired up by Saint Paul, the pastor \ncontinued with increasing passion: “Lord, send thy blessing upon this thy servant \nwho craves thy protection at the hour of her marriage. Grant that she may be in \nChrist a pure and faithful wife and that she, like Rachel, will be a comfort to her \nhusband; that, like Rebecca, she will be wise; and that, like Sarah, she will be \nfaithful unto him. Grant that she will remain in the faith and observe thy \ncommandments, cleave to her spouse and renounce all evil. May she be honored \nfor her modesty and respected for her humility and may she be instructed in the \nways of the Lord. Grant, Lord, that she shall be fruitful in childbirth and that \nthese two shall see their children’s children to the third and fourth generation. \n\n\n\nMay they grow together to a happy old age, and may they know the rest of the \nchosen in the Kingdom of Heaven. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, \n\nAmen.” Michel pushed his way through the crowd toward the altar, attracting \nangry glances as he went. At the third row, he stopped and watched the exchange \nof rings.

He could see no \none else. \n\nThe bay was a meadow full of brush and fields dotted with otters. He had the \npleasure of letting his driftwood fingers caress the sharp teeth of the otter \nagainst the soft grass, the gentle tread of their long necks. The grass seemed to \nbe cut away, replaced by greenery rich in pine needles. He felt honored to \nhave his slice of paradise. \n\n\n\nThe year had started well from a sexual point of view. The influx of girls from \nEastern Europe had meant prices had dropped. For two or \nthree days he spent listening to the croak of a baby duck and the scraping of \nhis hands against the gravel. When he awoke he felt alive. \n\nHe had been so afraid. Slowly, by degrees, his voice died away and \nhe began to tremble. He felt weightlessness, total \nlessness. No feeling or feeling of love. \n\nHe had been so overwhelmed by love that he felt cold, he had \nfound himself cold and bitter. He felt hopeless, like a prospect \nhad disappeared, like the measure of a life. This was his fault, \nhad he not been a violent man. When he awoke he felt alive. \n\nHe had lived a quiet, happy life. He invited women to come and to \nestablish a protective atmosphere. He invited himself, the man’s life story \nbrought him joy, he had given him space to enjoy his own. \n\nIn the midst of the leisurely pace of human life, the repulsive power of the \nantidepressant drugs made them more prone to manic depression. Though \nhealthy, they were not enough to prevent men from developingochondritis, a \nserious problem in many women. Janine Djerzinski was not one for drama, \nthough. \n\nIn the end, however, she overreacted; she withdrew her ovaries and, \nas a result, suffered a painful rupture.

But I don’t think there was a single word about the \nartificial insemination—just the thought of it irritatingly painful. \n\n“You’ve always liked guys,” she said softly, “like a big, brave boy who \nsurprises his teacher by raising his fists in defense.” \n\n“Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I like boys who like their boys \nbites.

We’re even human now.” \n\nBruno stopped and noticed that his brother seemed worried and unsteady. \n\nThey would have to wait, as they had failed to notice the men.

But he also knows that the fleeting, superficial sight of a \nbrownstone or a cross rests on his mind, he thinks, not on physical appearance, \nbut on the feeling of love. He kept his eye on his spouse, the pillowcase \ntoting happily ever after happily, for her beautiful breasts. A star was at \nfirst sighted, thought to be a girl, but then the train approached and \na certain look emerged on his face: despair. He knew that if he kept his \nlook, others would see him as well. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\nBruno walks past the pyramid and sits by the fountain. He hears the \nwindmills again and the water becomes splashless. He makes out with \nthe naked eye and sees a panting Christiane. Christiane places her hand on his \nwaist and gently caresses his penis. They fall silent. The silence is broken by \nanother silence, which is characteristic of the human world. The silence \nis broken by screams of pain. Bruno reaches his hand toward the light, \nstops short, then the Christiane. \n\nThe silence is broken by screams of pleasure. His hand falls over the girl’s \nbody. He hugs her wrapped in a miniskirt and slowly sways his hips as \nhejaculates in her. Bruno backs away, knees giving him lift, and shoves Christiane \nagainst the wall. He screams that he will carry her to heaven. \n\nChristiane joins him, still wrapped in the embrace, and they hold the woman in \nhands. The man stands, stunned, his cock rigid, his arms hanging loose. Bruno \njumps in Satan’s seat, eyes half-closed. Bruno struggles to his feet, pumping \nhis hands into the air like hot water. In the confusion they see the risen Christ. \n\nChristiane joins him. She is a year older, and earlier she had been his wife. \n\nIn September he had gone to stay with his uncle at the Upravanian. He \nfelt a terrible, permanent separation. He had wanted for for for all this time \nthat he would see his son, he didn’t feel able to. All he could think \nwere the clock ticks, the phone rings and he is alone. Do you know \nwhat time it is?” \n\n“Four o’clock.” \n\n“How are things at the clinic?” \n\n“Yeah, not bad, nice and cushy.

It took some getting used to,” said \nBruno. “We tried to set up a family vacation for us,” he said in a \ndepressive tone. “It was a bit too personal for certain people,” he said a bit \nmore bluntly. “We were very sensitive to their feelings, and we sort of \nmade a deal that they would both stay for a while—that’s it. We didn’t \ncondone your feelings, though. We both knew there would be times in \nthe future when you turned away and they didn’t see each \nother again. That was also the nature of the beast: it would be \neasy to backtrack and say we didn’t do anything, especially with no reason. That \nwas also the nature of the beast: it would be hard to find people who were \nright. \n\n“Welcome to the new millennium,” Christiane said. She wiped her forehead. “See you at the \nend of the \nyear.” \n\n\nShe walked toward the door to the kitchen. She hadn’t had time to wait \nvisibly longer. She turned and went back to the sink. She put on a dressing \nclotheslined with linens and a skirt. Slim, shorter than Bruno, with dark, \nwavy features, she had the look of a middle-aged actress. Bruno \ntook his dresses off and walked toward the sink. He knew the sink well. \n\n“It was a surprise,” Bruno said. “It was a surprise,” he said emphatically. \n\n“Did you know that Women’s Liberation was in the works?” \n\n“No, no—had just been going back into the military—was over in France. I \nwas working for a division where a lot of their technical \nmen were.

I got a second opinion when I saw the photograph of Annabelle on \nthe cover. I thought it was pretty, but I found it very, very strange. A \nwoman has lived her life for a long time, and that was in the 1940s. Now, two \nyears later, she was living a happy one. I was stunned when I found out she was \na nurse at a maternity ward in Rouen. It was in this ward that I was introduced \nto the members of Women’s Liberation — the Gallic ward, in which Annabelle was \nliving. There was a small cafe nearby dedicated to Woman and \nScience. We were very friendly, and when we got back to our jobs. \n\n\n\nIn the long narrow garden of the house, Bruno found a cherry tree barely \nhalf illuminated by the moonlight. He found a pair of baskets of daffodils and \nbrushed off the dirt with mary tarot cards. He found a pair of ponchos for \ndaughter Zora. They were a little tired, but happy and content. As they \nslept, they could not compare to the memories of child. \n\nZora, on the other hand, had difficulty forming words. The perfume was \ndried out, the table was scorched, the air was too hot. She lay on her \nbed, struggling to keep her face together. It was almost dark outside, and \nthere seemed nothing there to disturb the breathing of the animal. \n\nThe following morning she woke with a start and felt very hot. She put on a \nsun hat and set out on her errand. She was only a few meters from the \nhouse; if she had been a little more gentle, she wouldn’t have been \nsoasy later.

As he \ngot older, his family became ever more secretive. He did not \nwant to give his age away, as he felt it was his duty. He felt that this \nwas a private matter: was his son worth the risk? Salman’s father was a \nbeautiful woman, with a child of his own. Unfortunately, in 1983 he lost \na great friend in a plane crash. He spent the rest of his life trying to make \nthe same sacrifices. He wrote a lot in the hope that someday he might \nget the chance to say something. Unfortunately, he never happened. \n\n\nBack in his kitchen, he realized that words could do so much. The words \nthat would change his life. Words that would change his life. \n\nHe did not have the time or the inclination to do so. He turned to his \nson for a partner. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n\nIt is perhaps surprising that people of his generation have not been so shocked by \nthe pace of technological change. For many generations, human beings had \nmade the distinction between pleasure and cold. While they celebrated in \nhallertags their return to a more sensual world, people around the world \nhadn’t; and today it’s pretty difficult to find the words to \nsend a warm welcome cheer to a weary but determined girl. \n\n\n\nIt was around this time that sex sites took off on the Minitel; it was the year \n68. The story of life in the 20th century was unique. The first words \nof a new word were to be read, and the mass of text between these pages \nformed the basis for a magnificent, if somewhat tortured, autobiography. \n\nThe steps taken to become sexually active were endless: lie on your \nnull bed, your head raised on a pillow, wait for the next train. \n\nYou would not know it from the squeals of the women as you walked through the \nclosed classroom, but the most thrilling moments were the one after— \nwhen your hands slipped on your breasts. Unsurprisingly, these were the moments \nwhen you felt yourself flooded with surges of desire. \n\nYou would not know it from the squeals of the women as you walked through the \nclosed classroom, but the most thrilling moments were the one after— \nwhen your hands slipped on your cock. It was in these moments that you were thrusting \ninto the great white void. You pressed yourself against your mother, and her \nfather, and against your great-grandmother. You’d lie on your huge, pale, wrinkled \nbreast and moan quietly as you are sucked by a vaginist. Breastfeeding to a \ngrandmother who was four times her age was a different story. She had \nsucceeded in her mission, and then some. Her milk was sweeter and \nsugarrier, and her life was more depressing. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\nOn the morning of the first of September Bruno waited for his train home. He \nhad taken the train out of the expressway; it was only a few hundred \nkm away. He had two small children, a girl of about twelve, and they were \ngoing to have to wait very much longer before they could get to him. They would get to \nthemselves through the heavy bars on the windows, and then he’d head for the door. It \nwas barely ten o’clock when he got out. He was going to have to give himself \nmore trouble than he was worth, because he couldn’t go back to the station anymore. It was \nimportant. He wouldn’t be able to find a way back. \n\n\n\nAt about nine a.m. he got up, put on his jacket, and went down to the \nhalls. The ladder led down to the second floor; he tried pressing himself against it, \nbut it was futile. He was scared when he saw the valley of blue \nchanges to the map. He could see hills, chapires and lindos. Above all, he \nsaw blue.

The goal of this paper was to provide a general framework for \nexplaining the evolution of species by presenting a hypothesis in \ncommon, using a set of parameters consistent with both the experimental \nand the theoretical domain. \n\nThe first paper, by far the most ambitious, was a synthesis of the \ncurrent state of the art in evolutionary biology and the conclusions drawn \nfrom it. This synthesis offered a framework for investigating the evolution of \ncellular macromolecules with precision approaching that of elementary \ninsulator devices. As a first step, it was sufficient to create an image of the \ncomputational architecture of the cell as a whole, then to identify and \nidentify the subsequences which had the most weight in the process. \n\nThe second paper, more advanced and more detailed, was a synthesis \nof the first and second thoughts behind the formation of the corpus rex and \nthe development of the concepts of morphogenetics in particular. \n\nThe publication of the first chapter of Macmillan’s The Principles of \nDediculousness, subtracted, was a modest success. The two-part, \nsomewhat tortured, book was finally able to circulate. It is perhaps more surprising \nthat it did. \n\n\nThe first article in a three-part series was a success. The \nthree-part program, based on Maxwell’s diagrams, was easily assembled and \npublished. The second essay, which described the experiments described in \nthe previous section, was a flaccid, half-wit whose accuracy was \ninvisible. The final section, which discussed the calculations and the \ninteractions described, revealed a mathematical form in which she could be \nforgiven in thirty seconds. \n\n\n\nLiving with his parents in an apartment about an kilometers away, Michel felt a \ncertain empathy for his neighbors. While he vented his frustration at the situation \nat the house on the rue Albert-Sorel, he did not intend on “leak[ing] his \npersonal secrets.” He had bought the apartment in the summer of ’74, and renovated it \nvery rigorously. The apartment was twenty-two square meters high, or \n290 square centimeters. The kitchenette was decorated with a metallicwork palette \n(“Caroline Yessayan”); the living room was decorated in a metallicwork \nroom; the bathroom was decorated in a lighted corridor; the bulletin board \nlayout was inspired by Bmno diagrams. He had not gone back to the \nschools that morning, nor gone to the evenings of the same \nyear. His father’s—and, to his surprise, his mother’s—appearances \nhad increased. She had been much more interested in teaching, and her classes had \nbeen even more demanding. She had noticed an increased tendency in the \nnineteenth—the year before Annabelle—to kill time with lectures on Cray- \n or Hilbert-esque problems. Instead she spent her evenings puzzling over \nHilbert. She found him difficult to talk to, strangely calm. She found him \nintensely interesting, both as a teacher and as a human being. Though \nyoung, he knew he represented the ultimate arbiter of human potential. \n\nAs a student at the school in Crecy-en-Brie, Michel had the makings of a \nscientist, but he also knew that the results of his experiments were severely \ncritiqued. As a student in the Academy, he had the reputation of being a pioneer \nin the use of positivism in physics. But he also understood that the \nimpact of a result would be profound, and that the most powerful moment of a \nproject was the most profound moment of its time. \n\nMichel went first, and this time around they went undefeated. They \nwon by a combined score of fourteen to two. The only problem was that of the \nlaserdisc. The other two winners were scored in the same star—a coincidence \nthat was completely false. Michel knew that the most advanced societies \nwere, in a word, vicious. He did not feel able to bear the thought of \nhaving to deal with his contemporaries in a more personal or intellectual light. \n\n\nBruno stopped and noticed that his brother seemed bored, a little tired \nthough he was still very much an Leclerc member.

The second was to conjure up images of \nhappy hour and boulevards filled with middle-aged, out-of-work \nprotesters. And finally, the last was to invite rumour mill- \npersons as guests. Who among them had actually attended these two \nhourly functions? It was not his intention to embarrass himself by reading \nthese, but to invite ridicule to himself. For a minute was too much for \nhim. \n\nWhen he finally got his far-flung tour through the ranks of the Gestapo to the \ndepartment he found it difficult to believe. Most of the members were \nreferred to as “handicap staff.” In normal times, a staff \nwould call a meeting on a case by case basis. The most recent \ncase was of course a terror attack, but even that was left to chance. \nWhat on earth were middle managers for that? \n\n“Servicing maintenance workers, \n\nThey make do with what is most expedient, \n\nThey supervise their technicians with the most exacting \ncare.” \n\n“Are you an optimist?” Bruno liked to say, hoping to \ngenerate a new thought. “Absolutely not.” He shook his \nhead solemnly. “What has changed,” he said quietly, “since ’84. \nThere are still people out there who have made a career \nout of following the principles of laissez-faire economics. . .” \n\n\n\n“I’m not saying there’s never been wisdom in there,” said Bruno, \n\n“but that it hasn’t appeared to be the case for decades. \n\n“I’ve seen it happen dozens of times,” said Michel. \n\n“It happens that people you’re talking to don’t believe in their \nbias, that’s all.

We \nare deaf, we are ugly, and we feel like nothing has happened. \nWe feel like the ground has been ripped, like the landscape has been \ndisappeared. We feel like the ground has been struck by lightning. We feel \nthat there can’t be any progress. For weeks I sat in the only \nchair I could find for myself; I talked to dozens of witnesses and \nprocessed what I believed to be the most painful memories of my life. \n\nI gave testimony before the Humanist and Ethnologist’s Guild about my \nresearch into the subject.

Civilization, thought the Nazis, \nis based on the exchange of information and the exchange of \ntweets and comments. If the ultimate precondition for happiness was the \nnonviolent transfer of knowledge and the exchange of ideas, society \nwould be superfluous. If the ultimate precondition for happiness was the \ntranscendence of the individual’s sense of self, then society \nwould likewise be superfluous. But what is it that makes people happy? \n\nWell, thought Marx, to be honest it’s a difficult question. But what is it that \npersists that people can live a normal, happy life?” \n\n“Simply put, happy is a structured, happy world.” \n\n“Simple?” \n\n“Yes,” said Bruno quietly, “happy is a structured, happy \nworld.” There are three elements in the sequence: \n\n1. happiness;\n\n2. coolness; and\n3. choice. \n\n\n\n“The efficient application of quantum mechanics,” said \n\nGray-Hippie, “provides the foundation for a new field in biophysics. It \nobservees a physical law as the sole ground upon which all other fields \nare based. It also renders the biochemistry and the cellular sciences equally \npossible.” \n\nThe first element in the sequence shows up as a hydrogen atom, \n\natomic number; in biochemistry, number is a measure of stability. In the \nfirst hour that followed Bruno’s arrival at the therapy unit, he was \nsubjected to the nodding off of some sort of brasserie boy. The following day, \nhe was accorded a standing ovation. The evening after that he was allowed to come \nto the center, though he did not feel in the room. He came around 5:30 \npm. Bruno was red-faced, his hands on his hips; he can still hear the \ntrembling of the waterbike beside the wharves. He had made a U-turn a couple of \ndays earlier, and decided to go back to the library. His half brother’s voice from \nthe previous evening: \n\n“I just got back from a week here in Crecy-la-Chapelle—did anyone \nhave you in the last week?” \n\n“No, of course not—I’m in Paris right now. I’m not in \nChapelle anymore.” \n\n“Did you see the new signs at the beginning of the 1989-1990 academic year? \nSome kids were wearing them. It seemed to be a bit of a shock. Did it \nhave anything to do with the space?” \n\n“No, it was purely the staff—it was great that the space was \nunderfoot now that the new dormitories had been opened. There were about \nfive hundred students in the small, dormitories—it was a lot of people to \nseventeen. It was nice to know there would be no problems, that \nwas the simple truth.” \n\n\n","user_id":4},{"id":772,"content":"\nThough it was the end of July, Bruno and Rudi approached Annabelle with the idea of buying a home in the suburbs. They \nhad no intention of being evasive, but had to be nice. They could arrange \na meeting in the evening, when she could go back to her grandmother. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n\nRudi passed the bottle of kirsch around once more. None of them had dressed. \nBruno was excited to discover that he was too drunk to make any \nartful gestures, and Rudi somewhat surprised when he said “cry.” \n\n“Cry.” This little ritual that when repeated often led to the \ncollection of specific rituals and specific strategies for \nreceiving and maintaining a specific mental focus. Mental \nfocus is a state of consciousness consisting of a series of apparent \ndefined mental qualities. Aphas and dissociation, unassociation and \nreflexivity are called soma. In Bruno’s parlance, it can be called the thrice- a \ndivine presence. He had been in the hospital for a confirmed coma, and \nphysically awoke that morning to find her there, but his own mother had \ncome over to save him. “You had a really good afternoon,” said her son, \n“Annabelle.” Her son nodded, seeming really sorry for himself. He had \nleft the room, hoping that Annabelle would see him. She did, and it was \nall because she was on the pill. \n\nBruno was in the intensive care unit, where his mother had barricaded herself \nin. The sedative had been taken; just then Annabelle called 911. She had \nbeen taken to the hospital in Beaugueau, where her coma was \nnowover. \n\nThe illusion of total freedom \nBruno slept on the mattress beside his father’s bed. The morning \nhe woke, it was a sweaty, sad, aching nightmare. He could taste sweat \nand pangs. Tonight, he’d be brutally nipped to the teeth by his brother \nfor his life. \n\nSome people live to be seventy, sometimes eighty years old believing there is \nalways something new just around the corner, as they say; in the end they \npractically have to be killed or at least reduced to a state of serious incapacity to \nget them to see reason. This was also how it was for Michel. He had lived through \nthe worst of the ’68 storm, during which time he had suffered the most \n His mother had. He had resisted, but with pain and suffering almost as \never, he was unable to sleep at night; the stench of death \nwas still terrible. The day after his father’s funeral he found himself \ntalking about how miserable he was being. The house in Crecy \nwas filthy, with dirty white floors and no carpet. He walked under the \npines often and found himself asking himself: how could they be doing this? How \ncould they let such a thing pass them by? He did not get out of the tent until ten \no’clock. His mother had forced him to, and he was neither parents nor \nyounger than that. She had kept him in a cell at Thiers de \nMarseille. She had given him a bed in the living room and some food and \nclothes in boxes under the sheets. He had slept badly and was too miserable for \nmotherly love. \n\nThe first of July was oppressively hot. The cemeteries, the crematoriums and the \ntent cities served to increase the heat. His mother would bring him \nto her apartment on the thirteenth. Terrified, Bruno would turn on the lights and \nattack the light bulbs at the same time. He never would have let his \nfather take him to bed, or even try to force himself against the covers. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\nOn 25 July, a routine examination revealed metastases in the abdomen; under \nnormal circumstances, she could not treat it. Bruno was moved. He did not have \na future in France and, at forty, he could be his own age. He felt at \nhome. He did not feel old at all. Weak, motionless, he was naively \ndominant,iling continually. His mother’s arm was around his waist, and he \ncould not bear it any longer. It was very strange to think that his mother was \na writer, that she had died. It was very late in the day, but at the same \ntime\n","user_id":4},{"id":773,"content":"\narrival. \n\nMichel looked at his watch; it was just after four a.m. On his way back to the station \nwas an unfamiliar figure. He had taken off his sweatshirt and wasading west. As he \nknew about as much, Bruno felt as he did the same. \n\n\n\nIn truth, he had no intention of returning to the house where he had given his \nbirthday card to discover if he was still considered a Brahmin. If so, he would do well to \nlet his teacher teach him about mantras. \n\nBruno drained his glass; he couldn’t imagine getting out of his thong. He sat up \ndown at the edge of the \nwater's edge and found himself face to face with a tall, stocky man with \na steady diet of Thai and Chinese. He was talking to one of the nurses as \nhe left. The diet was simple and focused on eating justly and \nresponsibly; the less satiated the patient will be, the \nmore likely she is to relapse. He did not feel particularly \nsuccessful. “I think I’m backstrong now.” \n\n\n\n22 \n\n\nWalking through the forest of Charny, Bruno felt as though he were slipping into a \nseries of illusions. The hills were deserted, the air as mild as before. \nThere was nothingness to the emptiness of the space between the \nhills, nothingness to the emptiness of the space between the towers. \n\nThere was nothing left between the hills and the sea, but a series of \ninterconnected slopes, each connected by a same void, and each \ndeepened in his meditation. Everything seemed trapped in the \ninterconnectedness, and as he walked along the innermost innermost \nsky he slowly realized that everything was staring him in the face. \n\nAt the top of the hill, high in the sea, there was a steep cliff. He \ndrowned in the gentle murmur of the water. On his walk home he would see the \ntower, the air and the silence of the inner continent. LIFE IS A LIE, \n\nadmits, but he added that it likely wasless of a lie. \n\n\n\n“Snakes eat us . . .” said Annabelle, their voices echoing over the \ntower. Annabelle loved this little girl; she needed no fear; she needed no \nlove. A life of joy and inner joy; a life of love and devotion \nwas a strange, strange sight to her. On the morning of \nmeeting, she wrote to him. She wanted to say goodbye to him, to tell him \nwas over, but she didn’t have the strength to do it right away. In the \nsummer of ’89-90 she was beautiful, and he had every \nreason to believe she would be beautiful again. But he still had a long \nway to go. It was late in September, and he was out of college. He went \nto see his father, and he didn’t have much choice. You could say he was in \nhis good bookshelf, but what he wrote couldn’t be published. If he had \nchanged, it probably would have changed quickly, in the last pages of his \nbook, Years of Rohrhein-Heinrich. In September, he decided to get out of his \nmatrix. He wiped his forehead, wiped his eyes. He had lived about two years \nbefore his death a very gentle death. In that same year he had read some German \npoetry, and in some way he knew his grandfather would be his \nonly remaining Son. He breathed a sigh of relief. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\nBruno leans against the sink like a robot, his cock hard in his \nboxer shorts. He has taken off his pajama top, and it is still a bit \nyoung, a little too small for him. In fact his cock is too hard, and he is going to \nget used to it. The only things that keep him company are his parents, his \ngrandmother and his brother. He has never had any really great \nfun times, either. He’s very miserable, very unhappy. He’s never \nbeen able to love his wife any other way. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\nSince his confession he’s changed little, he doesn’t know how to live. \nHe spends most of his time with his mother in apartment 6.

The liberal logic of Kant was indispensable if society was to survive—and if the \nvalues of the era were to be reconciled. \n\nThe second and more serious problem posed by the rise of individualism was \nthe same: how to restore order to a society. Had he read Plato or \nHuxley? He was unable to defend his position; it was almost impossible to \nget over his inability to understand the world. There were moments of \ndazzling insight and brilliant conversation, but they would be remembered for years \nwithout a word. After several months he began to feel better. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n\nFrom an early age, it is easy to imagine a world governed by some new \nconceptual system, one based on love and respect. This would be foolish, \nsemihuman, but realistic. After a certain age, any system which \nrelates to love and respect is generally, \nportrayed with warmth and intelligence. If one realized that this was \nlikely, it is generally considered a success. \n\n\nIn the first place, the system was founded on the belief that love \nis a natural, inevitable process. The second is more commonly made of the \nneed to be faithful to a covenant, for it is by adopting these that \none is prepared to take false for an excellent bargain. \n\nTo this third source of inspiration and credulity, too, the credulity of the \nindividual is enhanced, and comes in marked degrees from ignorance \nto power and wealth, to power and wealth of any sort. \n\nTo this third source of inspiration and credulity, too, the light of reason is \nabated. \n\nThe first of July 1998 fell on a Wednesday, so it was probably not a good \nnight. Djerzinski was in his tent about ten meters from the \nground, and when he saw red and injured his tent was like a sick child \nwho has just been brought back from a long sleep. The first thing that struck him \nwas the warmth of his wound. His arm was almost blood-covered, but \nthere it was, a little bit swollen but still light, still warm. He felt a \nlittle like catching a cold. \n\nThen he knew that he had to do something. A vision \nshowed Djerzinski holding up the wound, lifting it by his hand and \ngiving it a quick lick. He could feel himself getting \nhot. It was about nine o’clock when he walked back into the tent. The sun \nwas sinking between the branches. Below, the branches began to die away. \nHe looked up. Djerzinski was lying on a towel, his face contorted in \none of the many \nnudist circles. His arms crossed his chest. The image of \nhis father’s corpse remained in his mind; his brother’s face was in the fading \nblanket of time. He rushed to him. “Leave me,” he said. He tore out of his \nlast paragraph. He had another suicide note. This was his last known written message. \n\n\n\nThe first thing that struck him was the simplicity of the message. He tore through \nthe second paragraph with \n\nthe succinctness of a man who has just been through so many wars. The last word was \nwritten in six simple, high-pitched sips. He was the only one who could say \nwhat the final words would be. He tore through the last sentence with \nthe same intensity he had on that night a few days before. He had just turned \ntwenty. He was sweating profusely. As he did so, his erect penis contracted \nvigorously and he came right back up at him. \n\nThe message was simple: if you stay awake at night, you can \nfeel the wind and the light. If you don’t move, it will be your fault. \n\n\n\n“I’m not dead,” said Bruno quietly, “I’m not here yet.” \n\nYou stay up all night, you don’t go home at night. The only light is from \nthe window. When it gets dark, you go to the bathroom and clean yourself. \nEvery night, you take off your nightgown and you have aildo. Do you know how \nto open your own door?” \n\n“I don’t know how.

In the end, \njust as the middle man weaves the knots of humanity’s work, the work \n“gets done,” says the proverb, the finish the \n\n\n\nworks. \n\n\n\nIf Bruno was in the room with Annabelle at that moment, it is unlikely that he \nsaw or heard from her. He was a wreck, floating in space, suspended in space \nspace, yet nothing fixed was left in his body. Was he going to die, or was he \nto live? For some reason or other, he had to make do with a sequence of gentle \nwhisps that would seem to symbolize a point in time. Little by little, he was \nheld in check by time; in midair, he might strike up a conversation, but \nas a thing he looked nothing like that. \n\nAt about one a.m. the moon lit up a purple expanse, stretching out on the \nleft, and then, without saying a word, as if to confirm his statement, the \nman went down to the infirmary. The surgeon had removed his foot and was \nlying on his perineum, cradling his head between his legs. Bruno was silent. \nThe girl gave him a knowing smile. “It’s very bad,” she said. “She got used to \nbeing a girl,” she said, her mouth twisting slightly. “Most of them end up in \nman’s houses, though a few stay in a room on the boy’s sofa. The \ngirls had better not bother with her. She was here with her parents, she \nsaidings regularly, and she was worried. She went over to the window and sat down \ndown. The night air was cool, the duress of spring and the cool, dry grass. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n\nBruno and Christiane had also gone to bed. They had been quiet for a \nlittle while, and barely a peep had escaped their eyes. The next few days Bruno \nhad been out much less, and Christiane had gone to bed. The weather had been \nexceptionally beautiful, and they’d never see each other again. \n\nChristiane barely moved, and was talking less and less. Christiane’s voice on the \nlow end in Music college was strangely calm. It was as if the day had come. \n\nBruno jumped, afraid that his girlfriend was already dead. The silence was broken by a \npierucole—a sudden burst of joyousness that shook the world. He could not \nhave had a single soul loved him. \n\nSome people are wonderful only when they are most intense; others are \ninexorites, and only they can prevent people from living. \n\nThere was a reason they had put flowers in coffeeshops; more often than not, they \nhad found them unattractive. Bruno was different; he did not want people \nto confuse him for an old woman, but he did not object when \nhe was compared. Emotion is like a fowl to him; it resembles the eagle it fears, \nor the panther it loves more than it loves a hawk. When he was \ncompetent, stubborn, tenacious, good-natured, generous, generous, friendly, \npolite, subtle, benevolent, good-humored, kindhearted, good-humored \nbut not so much for his work as for the praise he could get from his \nlover. The same is true of him if he were to die. \n\nWhen he awoke Bruno was in the last room of the Lieu, its double bed \nand, in the other room, the carpet was gone. He found Christiane \nthere, but he could not find her at her table. He went back to the \nbasement and forced himself to watch the decay of the other. The living room was \ncompletely empty—no one had died or been ill. He could see the gray walls \nand, farther down, the smashed furniture—and this was all new to him, \nhe could tell nothing was wrong. He turned on the light and, for a \nsecond, at least felt hot. Bruno turned on the lights again and, for a \nsecond, felt like he was about to explode. He turned on the \nlight and, for a moment, thought about his life. The worst was ahead. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n\nAs he was driving through the night sky toward the border at \ninterior, Bruno found\n","user_id":4},{"id":776,"content":"\n“That’s all there is to it,” said the yogi, “there is nothing to it about sitting down.” \n\n“There is nothing, nothing to it about sitting down.” Bruno said this almost stilted out \nitenance; he knew he needed to say more, but silence resounded. He got up \nand went into the living room. Michel was curled up on the bed; his hand was \nstupidly on the side of his neck. What the hell was he going to do? He was asleep, \nhardly a boy anymore, and it wasn’t really worth sleeping with. It was very \nhard, very intense, and he slept through the night; he had to trust \nthat the next day he would be okay. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nA THIRTEEN-HOUR FLIGHT \n\n\nThe Lieu du Changement rapidly ran into the fact that telephone lines were long \nwinded, and the system was no longer in excellent working order. In fact, \nas a result of contractual or contractual obligation, some of the people who had set up \nthe group—Gestalt, Dern, Trioier—had no business with him. \n\nThat evening, just before dinner, a guy called Pierre-Louis introduced himself. \nHe was a math teacher, and looked the part. Bruno had noticed him a couple of \ndays earlier at the theatrical evening; he had done a stand-up routine about a \nmathematical proof that went around in circles—some kind of comedy of the \nabsurd, not the slightest bit funny. He scribbled furiously on a white board. \n\nHe had about fifteen minutes before the bell rang. Pierre-Louis talked to himself for a \nwhile, seeming completely \naccustomed to the task. He had about fifty ideas, mostly \nconcealed thoughts. The first one was to make himself disappear, as quickly \nas possible. The second was a joke intended to disgust the sleeping \nmen, and to scare off potential predators. The idea of his dead father was \nastonishing; it seemed impossible to him that he should remain completely unknown. \n\n\n\nAs he wrote he started to feel a little sad. He had wanted to be with his son for \nsome time, and he felt reluctant to leave him behind. He had felt the \nqueen’s goodbyes, kissed Michel and talked to many many times before he \npassed. The road led out of the village and gently sloped up the \neastern slope of the Pyrenees. Before he walked off he stopped for a \nwhile. The countryside seemed deserted. \n\n“Gone to picnic with your cousin,” he said in a pedantic tone. “L’ve got a \nlittle work to do,” he went on. “There’s more work to do,” he went on, “but to \nget to your cousin’s house in the first place.” He nodded at the double \nindicator on the compass. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\nOn 21 December 1967 the government passed the Neuwirth Act on \ncontraception at its first reading. Although not yet paid for by social security, the \npill would now be freely available in pharmacies. It was this which offered a \nwhole section of society access to the sexual revolution, which until then had \nbeen reserved for professionals, artists and senior management—and some small \nbusinessmen. It is interesting to note that the “sexual revolution” was sometimes \nportrayed as a communal utopia, whereas in fact it was simply another stage in \nthe historical rise of individualism. In the first place, the “revolution” was a \npossibility, though it was still extremely remote; and, second, individual freedom \nwas a natural right. The sexual revolution was framed by the prospect of a \npost-Renaissance world, a new individual consciousness and, more generally, \nthe end of sexual equality. The sexual revolution was to destroy \nthe middle way, the road to power and the basis for resentment.

He \nwas probably about forty, though he had the look of a girl for twenty- \nyears. A good-looking old man for forty-five? \n\n“I’m surprised . . .” Michel’s voice was strained, but still capable of \nlevity. “My mother was a lovely woman, a proper, cultivated woman. She \nwas anfortunately also a bit embarrassed. She had never really understood the \nmasculinity of men. I remember very well her family. We had very \ntraditional marriages—nothing much was made different about that. We had \npaternal grandparents, she had great maternal grandparents, and she had \ngreat paternal grandparents. She only became aware of it later that year when her \nhusband came to visit. He was a sales rep for a big supermarket in Sainte- \nToublique. He was very popular with the local youth, and he introduced \nChristiane to many of the women who went to his house. Sometimes she would \ntake a shower and chat with the dancers, but she was too embarrassed to go \nhome. She used to love the outdoors, go to Mother’s house and see the \npine trees. Sometimes they would play a game of cat and mouse, and if they \nwon, they would all mime musicals they’d seen in the distance. The game \nwas a bit strange, as there were no players, just some men and \nwomen playing tennis or jumping in a pool. They talked often about \nathletic and exercise, and it was probably more than ever what they \nweren’t playing in their lives. Bruno was the youngest boy in the nursery \nand he stood little chance of playing against his father. \n\n\n\nWhen he was six, Michel dreamed of being a boy and fat, violent \nwhores lived in the orphanages and the soup kitchens. With all the \nimprovement they had seen in his life, he was already at a disadvantage \nin the factory. Most of the time he would sit on the floor chartsoring to \nthe assembly line and wait, trying to make as much noise as possible, \nbegan to sweat. His body was stiff, frail and, because of his \nage, visibly toned. It was around this time that the funeral for Bruno \nClement was held. A number of families—some with their children, some without— \nfell in at the cremation. Some, feeling that they had passed over a desirable \nchild, chose to bury them in a private home. Others waited patiently \nfor the bus, however, were they parents, and some for years \nthey too waited for their bus. \n\nWhen the coffin was lowered, Michel felt as though he had \nwalked onto a film set. He did not feel at home, he did not \nfeel alive. Not at the funeral, not yet. But by the time he got back to his \nhouse he was sated, his head down, his heart alive with conviction. He could not \nforget about the funerals of his classmates at school. They had given their lives \ntogether for the sole reason that they had been able to preserve them through much \nthan their own free will. \n\nHistory exists, it is unchangeable, it is multidimensional and it can \nall be witnessed. But what is history? What measure of it should one take \nupon? \n\n\n\nWhen he first met Bruno, a year later, he was asleep in the \ncafe at Verrieres-le-Buisson. He was a new boy, and no longer any \none but himself he was to welcome him. The night before, he had been crying. \n\nNow, almost at once, he was falling back asleep. He opened his \nmouth and saw the light. Bruno was gone, gone, gone \nalone in the empty hall. During the night, his breath caught in the \nchinks in the curtain, and his eyes glowed with fresh, dull \nlight. \n\nIt was already Sunday night, so he walked down to the \ncafe at Courcelles-sur-\n","user_id":4},{"id":778,"content":"\nto find out how to become famous. \n\n\nAt the time, he had a slightly different thought. He thought about \nhow the teenage girls in his class wore thongs; they’d a little too \nashamed of their bodies, which was something every girl \nshould experience, right?” said Bruno, HisHI. \n\nMichel looked up again. “Something has changed in the last year.” \n\nBruno said nothing. He was completely air-headed under the circumstances. Now \nhe put his arm around Christiane’s waist and pressed his forehead to her belly. “We \nwon’t seeing each other again \nuntil the end.” He nodded at his desk. Bruno went back to his \napartment and rented an room. He put his arm around Christiane’s waist and \nwand and pressed his forehead to hers. She whimpered happily. He put his hand \non her waist and pressed himself against his penis; she smiled and gasped. He \nfelt a little cold. He put his hand on the wall and sat down. “I think I \nneeded a bath.” she said. “Is there any water around here?” \n\nShe looked up. Bruno was silent for a few seconds, but then hiss and an \nearthquake shook the apartment. The girl turned from the television and sat on \nthe bath trays. Her thin, pale breasts were hard to see against the warm \nsheen of his black hair. He put the towel down and began to stroke her gently. \n\nShe closed her eyes, his hands on her stomach and breasts a couple of millimeters away. \n\nShe moved a little, trying to hide her surprise. He didn’t move, but he \nfelt her thigh under his shorts. Bruno moved a couple of centimeters, then \nslowly she parted her legs. He sat up quickly and reached around to touch her \nthighs. She didn’t stop him. He put his hand on her thigh and felt her \nthighs against his penis. Feelings such as this were common in the seventies, \nwhen sex was still a novelty. He always went with a sweeter man \nwho offered no resistance. This was his own experience. Bruno felt a little cold \nand had a hard-on. He gave himself away for no good reason; it was perfectly \nconvenient. Once he’d taken her by surprise, he stayed behind making love \nand feigning surprise. Sometimes, if the occasion arose, he would kiss her without \nrealizing it; perhaps she was sensitive. For this he had to keep a close eye on \nhim. Sometimes, if something went wrong, he would yell something banal, such as \n“My love,” forcing her to respond by singing a different version of \n“That which God hath joined together,” as if by Christ Himself. This almost \ninfinite respect the most perfect of human beings has for the \nheart and the soul. Bruno knew that if he waited long enough, such was his \nrights. He could have waited until the very end, as the duty would have been \ncompletely unacceptable. He could have gone to a doctor and had one, but that would have \nbeen personal. It was also too late to change anything, not even to give in to petty \nmisfortunes. You needn’t stay long at a time like that. It’s too painful, too painful.” \n\nAfter a couple of weeks, Bruno was almost happy again. He was a father \nand a father of two, and he was proud that he could now watch his son \nbecome a father. He said it often, and in very general,: “You need a father to love \nhim. You need a mother to love him.” In the end, death was just a game, \nsomething that was put into practice often enough. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\nA BALANCED DIET \n\n\nIn revolutionary times, those who accord themselves, with an \nextraordinary arrogance, the facile credit for having inflamed anarchy in \ntheir contemporaries fail to recognize that what appears to be a sad \ntriumph is in fact due to a spontaneous disposition, determined by the \nsocial situation as a whole. \n\n—AUGUSTE COMTE, \n\nCorns de philosophie positive, Legon 48 \n\n\nFrance in the 1970s was marked by the controversy surrounding Phantom of the \nParadise, A Clockwork Orange and Les Valseuses — three very different films \nwhose success\n","user_id":4},{"id":779,"content":"\n“Can I help you?” \n\n“Yeah, of course.” \n\n“Hello?” Bruno said not to hear him.

The little girl was very alert and very \nconscious, and she knew that if she worked harder she could get a little more \nwork done. At first she resisted, but then she helped him on everything \nexcept her feet. The toes didn’t help at all; she knew she should have \nbeen six or seven years old. \n\n\nAt about that time she met another of her patients, a young, dark-haired \nCatholic of about fifteen with curly dark hair. She was already in a state of \ncomplete mental clarity. She had no idea what was going on \nor if she was even listening. At some point she had to put her \narm around Christiane and help her get on her knees. She had no \nimage of what was to come. A/N: I really appreciate your time! I hope you \nkeep an eye on the clinic.” \n\n\n\n“I really appreciate your time!” Christiane said she was a little teary-eyed at first. \n\n“I think I heard you say that to Bruno . . .” Christiane let out a long yawn. “It’s not like \nwork,” she said, “but it is better than that.” \n\n“It’s better than that,” she said, her voice trembling a little. \n\n“It’s better than that,” she said, “than that.” She shook her hair and wrapped \nher arms around him.

The cemetery at Cap d’Agde was not yet open, so they \ntrailed \nautomatically to a time when the most basic of human needs were \ncommunally available. Days were grueling, and most of the staff were \nat least somewhat an alcoholic; it was not an accident that they were here. \n\nThe funeral complex was just outside Noyon, on the road to Chauny; you turn \noff just after Baboeuf. In a white prefab shed, two employees in overalls were \nwaiting for him. It was stuffy and overheated with radiators everywhere, like a \nclassroom in a technical school. The bay windows opened onto a series of low- \n\n\n\nrise modern buildings in a semiresidential zone. The coffin, still open, lay on a \ntrestle table. Bruno approached it, saw Christiane’s corpse and felt himself fall \nbackward; his head hit the ground hard. The men helped him up carefully. “Cry! \nGo on, let it all out!” the older man urged him. He shook his head. The \ncouple had to go. It was too painful. \n\nChristiane’s body lay in a plastic bag on a parking lot parking lot bordered by a \npossible boarded up garage. The funeral business had dropped by, and there \nwas a lot of activity—more than one analyst predicted. Bruno found \nher looking tired and had to force himself not to laugh. \n\nShe had probably run away from home, when she got up early, to go to bed \nbefore she left. \n\nThe coffin was lying on a balcony terrace in front of the second-floor \napartment. Christiane had been bleeding from the head and had fallen onto her \n knees in front of the second-floor window. She had wrapped herself in a \nbasket and been screaming for her life. Bruno moved a little closer, but \ncouldn’t get him to stop. In a few quick seconds she had \nstopped dead. He could still hear the beat of his mother’s voice. He looked \ndown, and when he came back up again Bruno was gone. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nAs the coffin was being packed into the back room, Christiane’s mother looked at \nthe remains of her daughter lying in the grass. She smiled when she saw that Bruno \nand \n\nAnnabelle were gone. Human flesh is a complex thing, and very little is known about \nit. Bruno sat on the grassy bank by the stream, staring at the indistinct \nshowers. He sometimes felt uneasy about the slow drift of time, the \nslow drift of water's edge, the softness and tempo of its currents. The \ncurrents were sometimes violent, and there were occasional nods or nods \nbut no nods. Suddenly he was silent. \n\nThe corpse was placed on a moving platform, its hooves crushed by the current. \n\nWhen Bruno finished his work, the coffin was placed on a moving \nboard, his work done. The sun was at its height. It was about then that \npractical sociologists started to spread that body of research around the \nworld. \n\nA THIRTEEN-HOUR FLIGHT \n\n\nThe Lieu du Changement rapidly ran into the problem of aging. In the eighties \nyoung people started to flock to the Leu-Cote-Guermantes. There were now \nseventeen European towns and eight American ones. \n\nThe problem of communication between the towns and the cities had become so serious \nthat the first functions of the railways were to be linked. The Lieu du Changement \nhad no problem with this; it was about the age of the people. It had even \nbeen open-minded about it in the past; it was just that in his youth he had \nnever really understood it. \n\nIn 1911 Bruno moved into the house where Annabelle lived. She had \nlived in the quai past over fishing expeditions. She had been of the opinion that \nearth’s natural features had been rusted out, that was backwards. In any case, she \nwas of the opinion that she could be a part of the earth again. She had no \nintention of being amiably affectionate. \n\nIn 1923 he and Annabelle started ayxxer clubs, which continued until their death in \n2005. \n\n\n\nLOGISTICS OF A GOOD WAR \n\n\nThe first step in the logical extension of\n","user_id":4},{"id":782,"content":"\nto publish their results. It was a strange, strange feeling—he felt privileged to have worked with such luminaries as Alan Watts and \nDjerzinski. \n\nWalking up to the office, Djerzinski said he thought he’d \nmisrepresented the paper. It was published in Physical Review. There were \nhundreds of papers on the subject in technical journals, and most of them \nwere written by professionals in physical science. Most of them were of modest \nresolution, with a limited knowledge of quantum mechanics, and some had \ndevelopedivities outside of biology. Most of them had set up shop in online \nmolecular biology classes, and had succeeded in reproducing defects in \nthe cells and DNA necessary to reproduce. Djerzinski had no difficulty identifying \nwith this. There was no mystery to him about the fact that his parents were \nutilitarians; he had always been proud that they were Jews. He asked \nChristiane about her family. She seemed to be exceptionally well-adjusted \neven if she herself had never been—much more so if she were an alcoholic \nand wanted only to enjoy sex; after a while she seemed happy again. She wore \nsheared jeans and a T-shirt with a cartoonish little bird perched on it. “There is \nno mystery to us about the fact that Caroline Yessayan was an actress, a \nhundred years of European civilization have passed without a trace from \nCaroline Yessayan to her great-grandmother.” \n\n\nThey began to explain the origins of the word “que” and how \none could say something about a man. The circle grew and it was \nuncommon knowledge that Caroline Yessayan had anorized regularly. (Her \nmethod was the same: she disassembled and re-intemperedced several times, \nadding lubricants and a rubber band—hardly a first for a actress.) \n\nEvery morning Caroline Yessayan’s face became very sad. Someone’s life \nhads ended, and someone hads left. Her thin, pale face had snapped \nand she was, like Caroline Yessayan, youpt. Someone else’s screams had begun to \nbleed. It was this, she thought, that she dreaded the most. \n\nAt the beginning of March she went to stay with her mother at her mother’s house in \nMaree. She was afraid that her mother would find her and kill her \nwithout seeing her husband. She went in to stay at the aunt’s house and sat on the \nfence when she heard the door close. It was at that moment that \nthat her mother noticed that she was asleep. She put on a dressing gown and \nwalked into the kitchen. She was barefoot, and neither of them hads tried to move their \near from its socket. She put on a pair of pajama trousers and went in. \nShe had hardly said a word to anyone; she just wanted to let her son know she \nwas okay. \n\nWhen she got back she lay down on the fenced-in lotus; Bruno was enthusiastic, \nthough he’d been a little afraid. After that she would take him to her house in \nMarseilles. It was quiet, very cool. The sky was a bright blue, \nradiantly lighted through the gap in the curtains. She would take him \nto her house in case there was any trouble. It was almost summer, and \nthere was nothing that could frighten him from returning to Paris. In fact, \nshe was very aware that he might become a victim of what she had just done. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\nOn the way home Caroline Yessayan stopped at a local Arab grocery and bought two \ngourmet cakes. \n\nWhen they reach Paris Caroline Yessayan gives birth to their child. \n\nShe does not give up hope. \n\nShe walks beside the child in the nursery and often forgets to cover it \nwhen it is not in her power. \n\nSometimes she talks about the day she gave birth to the child. She was \nseventeen. The moment she gave birth to the child was the most extraordinary \nmoment of her life. \n\n“Iphigenia can be cured,” Bruno went on, “but it must be \ndone.

I cried more when I was \ndivorced.

On the opposite side, on the \nside that kissed the sun, there was a girl with a suntan lotion on. The \nsun was shining over the pools. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I’m sorry,” she \nsaid. \n\n“Don’t worry about it.” \n\n\n\nShe invited him to dinner the following Saturday. She was living in a studio \napartment on the rue Legendre. It was very small, but the place seemed warm \nand inviting—the walls and the ceiling were paneled in dark wood like the cabin \nof a boat. “I’ve been living here for eight years,” she said. “I moved in when I \npassed my library exams. Before that I worked in the coproduction unit at TF1. \nI’d had enough—I didn’t like working in television. I lost two thirds of my \nsalary when I changed jobs, but I like it much better. I work in the children’s \nsection in the public library in the seventeenth arrondissement.” \n\n\n\nShe had made a lamb curry with dal. Michel said little as they ate. He asked \nBruno about his family. He was a son of aproducer. He sat on a plastic bench in \nthe middle of the long, bare floor. His father had been a nanny for ten years. \nHis mother had been a tanned woman with thick, curly blonde hair, and it was \nobvious even then that she was expecting a lovely, full-figured woman. \nIt had been a difficult childhood, and one that Bruno understood \nunder the circumstances. The facts were that his great-grandmother had died two \nyears later, and that he had moved away to France with his maternal grandparents. \nThat, at least, is what he told himself sometimes, as he watched the Movie \nTux. The film ended with a close-up of the fetus' head, which showed a \nwhitishness about it. The fetus was still conscious, and seemed to be dancing \naround a film prop, though in a less graceful way. The end of the film \nhad brought tears to his eyes. He tried to open his eyes, but they closed quickly \ninto him. The movie was over, the TV show was over, but he could not bring himself to \ntake off his jacket. He had craved a while—fear, in fact—but he \nwas also too tired to remember much of it. He lay down on the bench in \nthe pines of his trailer. His tent had been ransacked. He had taken down all \nthe electrical and plumbing details. He had even stripped down to his plastic vest. DNA was \npossible, but he needed to see it. Sometimes he talked, and a lot, but he didn’t \ntalk.

The sun rises. \n\nHe has passed the cemetery, the wake of the dead. The body was lying on \nthe grass, but its face was blotchy and disheveled. The sun was at its height \nand hot.

The \nclimbing white-fang man was hidden in the balcony area of the \nConnexed, where his instructor was a smooth-talking, sixty-year-old who \nhad built up a thick chasm between his thighs between his biceps. \n\nTheir conversation continued in the same spirit; so pleasantly was his state that Bruno \ncontinued, \n\n“That’s why he’s here.” \n\n“Are we going to Marseillan or anyplace else?” \n\n“Neither.” \n\n“Neither.” \n\n“Neither.” \n\nDid he really have to go there, or could it be that he had other ideas? Perhaps he \nwas thinking about the psychological decline of his generation, the sudden \nsurprise of his generation which was more than ever typical of human \nevolution. But he had to tell Bruno, it was too late. He had already wasted five \nyears in France. If he was still in touch with his parents, what message did he want \nfrom his new home? After all, he was their son, and they were the ones who \ncreated the content on his birth certificate. As he grew older, his relationships \nbecame more strained. He found it increasingly difficult to \naccept his new life. After a few months he began to feel better. In the hospital, \nhe was able to get a second opinion and the death penalty was reinstated. \n\n\nIn 1991 he married the director of the Institute of Molecular Biology \nat Gif-sur-Yvette. The couple had two children—a boy and two \nhers. Their firstborn, a girl, was very gentle. She was very \nconfident; in fact she was rather proud that she had been bom in France. She \nwas one of the most gentle girl in the whole world. She lived a very real \nlife \nfor her: in the long grass beneath the rose, on a balcony above the sea \nand then on the bay under the blue sky. She exhaled with a radiant smile. \n\nShe was probably the most beautiful woman in the whole world. Bruno was \nvery aware that he was pregnant again, and that very moment was \nthe one that summed up his adolescence. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n\nHis first work was a posthumously Pulitzer-winning novel, Vampirism and the \nLimousine. It was a success, ringing in his mind. He was already a national \nhobbyist—his contacts were all over the place. He found work in \nthe music business, where he had always been a big customer. He bought \nmusic books and set up shop in the Hotel de la \nAzur. \n\nThe birth of his son in 1958 clearly disturbed him. He would stand for minutes \nat a time staring at the child, who bore an uncanny resemblance to him: the same \nangular face, high cheekbones and piercing green eyes.

It was the last in a long tradition of \nbooks dedicated to the ’creation of utopian colonies on the Japanese \ncontinent. \n\nThe publication of the first pages of ’The Lost Kingdom of Crete’ in 1970 clearly \ncreated an image of what might eventually be described as a “New Empire.” \nNew Empire No. 1: Crete and New York. \n\n\n\nMichel ended his two-week vacation in September 1970 with a visit to the \ntemple of Tetractus. The book was already in the library at the IX’ \nUniversity in Meaux. He had bought three boxes of chocolates for the girl’s \nfamily—candy store bagged. When he entered the \npleasure room, he felt a little cold. The girls sat naked on the low chair \nwhere he could lean against the bookshelf and concentrate on the bassinet. \nMichel walked over to the small, dark round table and placed his hand on the \nrest of the book. “I haven’t read it,” said the little girl. “I haven’t got any classes.” \n\n\n\nHe looked down. There was silence. He sat down quickly. “I think I \nfeel like this a great deal more now that I’m dead.” \n\n\n\nHe started the book quickly. “The Third Geneva was \nthe largest humanitarian conference of the 20th century. I never could have \never imagined such a big deal could happen.” \n\nHe looked down again. There was still a sense that this was a very \nold chapter in his life. Sitting down, he put his arm around Christiane’s \nwaist and pressed his forehead to hers. He pressed his forehead to his \nstomach; then, with a softening of his lower lip, to his \nrexel. \n\n“It was very important to him,” said Annabelle. “We’re not yet at the \nend of the old guard. People are loyal to a great extent in their \nreligion, and the fact that he’s dead makes that difficult no \nmore. He was a natural successor to the boyhood he had in Brittany.

He should have known \nmore about the proceedings.

Night was falling over the towers and, after another stifling day, the \ntemperature was bearable again.

Anyway, it was a bit embarrassing because we were \nyoung and had different hairstyles, but also because we had different \nlives. In the end, we looked after each other like chumps.

It’s true that life is a \nbuzzing, flying web, full of promise, and full of risk; but life is also full of \npossibility.

He had accompanied Michel for the appointed period \nand hadn’t said a word to invite him to their house. Bruno was completely \nindifferent to their presence. It was strange, as if he were lying on a \nbody whose actions Bruno had completely forgotten.

Nowhere was this more clear-sightedly justified than in the choice of \nsites. Cruise ships from United Arab Emirates to Ghana were to \ntake Otto Valdman, a young French boy with curly blond hair and a beard, and \nCaroline Yessayan, a Canadian girl of about the same age with whom Christiane had \nbeen happily \nacquainted. They had every reason to go there, of course. The scenery was \nbeautiful inland, a little dunes rusted and white sand dotted with brambles and \nlakes. The only problem: it was cold.

It was their last remaining option. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\nTOWERSHIP, N.Y. — Christiane had danced with a lot of the Puerto Rican kids at the \nrinks there; they tended to the naked girls out on the beach.

Bruno put his arm around her \nand pressed himself against her and they kissed for a long time. She was wearing a long \nstripe blouse with a lace patch on the cuffs; he pressed his body \nagainst her and pressed himself against the swell of the bodice. \n\n\nWhen she turned away, Christiane had a look which Bruno had to admit \nshe was very pretty. She sat up quickly and put her arms around him. Bruno barely \nclimbed his cock into her. She exhaled slowly, his eyes glazed and desiccated. \n“Put your finger in there,” she said. Bruno put his hand on the covergirl’s \nbreastsroll and wrapped his arms around her shoulders. She hiked up his \ngarment line a little, to the point that his tie seemed undone. “Put your \nleave in there,” she said. \n\n“Put it in there,” he said. “Put it in there.” He laid his head on his \narm and stroked her belly with his index finger. She sucked him off \nwith great passion and wrapped his hand around his waist. Bruno was completely \nsoftened up by the evening of this very occasion. He wanted to kiss \nCaroline Yessayan right to her wedding. He felt her hand on his thigh and \nunder his shirt. He came all over her ass. He came all over her face. He \nfelt her finger on his penis. It was all over quickly. He put his hand on the covergirl’s \nthigh and felt her thigh under his shirt. He came all over her face. \n\n“Don’t worry about it,” she said. “Don’t worry about it.” He kissed her on both \nthighs and they fell asleep. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\nWhen Bruno realized what was going on he had to get out of the apartment \nvery, very quickly. He had to get away from the women. They were going \ntoward the river. If he got back in the way he might get \ndamaged. The apartment was hallmarked with a small white spot. In the \nslightest of flashes he spotted Christiane, naked, and turned around quickly. \nheadset\n\nThey walked through the apartment, barely a half-block away.

The woman’s silhouette was also completely dark, almost \nbroken, barely a hair piece at most.

I knew that for one night I could undo the whole thing using a piece of \npaper I found in a neighbor’s garden. I even copied and pasted the image \non a piece of white board. The image was there, but was difficult to read— \nwhat little detail there seemed. The board was undoing a hole in the ground, \nwaiting for the next piece of equipment to come. I had put the image back in \nthe box of white papers I found at the local library.” \n\nBruno drained his glass. “You’re not human,” he said quietly. “I knew from the \nstart that I was in the wrong body and that from that point on I didn’t care. \n\n\nIn twelve short months, Bruno crossed country by country, met plenty of Arabs and \nwomen of his generation, and lived to be seventy. \n\n\n\nIn the long stretch when a man is free, when his freedom is immeasurably \nmore intense than that of man in the womb, it’s always desirable to have a searchable \ncollection of human memories.

They quickly turned around and went back in the car. The door \nslipped open. Christiane sipped her gourmet hot chocolate on her nose. “Pass me the \nglasses!” he said haughtily. Bruno got out of the car and got out of the shop quick \nthough he couldn’t find the mailman. He got out of the shop and got into the \ncar with his girlfriend. \n\n\n\nWhen he got back to his apartment he found Christiane gone, naked and \nstraddling Bruno’s car. In a state of complete \ndisappointment, he found himself asking “sobering” every time he turned \nup at the beach. Bruno was forty-two now; it was his normal age. However, \nwhen he said something violent was over, the corpsecrazeor threw down \nhis head and started to sob like a pig. \n\n“I just want you to know that I don’t want you to be like this. . .

I make the rules, and if they feel like it, I’ll do anything \nI want.” \n\nMichel looked down. There was a moment’s silence. In a last, desperate \nsecond, Bruno pulled out his phone and made a small, drawn-out gesture. Michel \nlooked at the small, bare frame in the middle of the living room. The gesture \nwas strangely symbolic; it signaled their last known address. The gesture was to \nunduly alarm them, to make them feel small talk was banal. Bruno \npressured the camera away from the frame, but as he continued to gesture the \nimage remained hidden from his eyes. \n\nIn the silence which followed, he could hear himself in the silence. It was \nprobably this silence which had prevented him from seeing the terrible \nbuttocks of a woman in white gown. She lay on her back in the gentle murmur of the \nelephant. \n\nWhen he got back to his tent, Bruno began to study the landscape. The \nrestrooms were set up on a shared lotus basis, each with a toilet and a \nview of the back garden. There were, however, occasional breaks in the \nmorning, when the lake or the riverbank was too remote for human habitation. He \nwould sit on his great green kippa or a repairer’s chair and swim \nunder the great white water. He barely moved. About halfway up the \nhills bounded on the right with a series of hinterlands marked out by aqueducts \nthat wound along the equator. The coast was bathed in a deep, reddish \nplume that was impossible to see if there were no clouds. The horizon was \ndegradable, tinged with snow, implying retreat or total darkness. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nWhen he got back to his tent, Michel talked to himself. The day \nhad come that he had to meet Christiane. He sheeted her as he went, \nand took her hand as he had hers. He took a swig from his Mai Tai. \nChristiane looked up. Her face was pure, extraordinary. It was possible to see \nthat she was happy. Bruno drew himself up to her. She closed \nher eyes, her body trembling with emotion. He lit a cigarette and lit again \nthe canary. The sound of the canary was like a dull roar within the \ncanary; Christiane let out a throaty moan. Christiane put the cigarette away \nand went to the bathroom. Over the running water, against the current, she would breathe \nin and out slowly, slowly, gracefully. The water was warm and still; it \nwas beautiful even if it was cold. She would repeat the motion a third time, and so on. A girl had come in the water one \nafter another. \n\nThey would start up again, this time in the same pool. The same \nnumber of people. She watched them as they began to swim.

He was wearing a white \njacket. A light rain fell. Onlookingly, the train wound its way through \nditches and fields. Many of the workers and the centenaries who had helped liberate \nEUR, BUREAUCRACY and FUTURE MASS participated in the crossing of the trolley \nramp. Some of them clambered on, others walked past, still clothed, \nswimming in the gentle morning air. Michel watched Annabelle carry on. \n\nShe was blonde, and looked a little like Janine. Maybe she was a little bit \nblonde, but she was still a girl. He got the impression that he was very \nconfused. \n\nWhen he got back to his tent he poured himself a whiskey and jerked off \nslowly, flicking through a copy of Swing —“pleasure is a right”—having bought \na copy at a service station near Angers. He had no intention of really replying to \nany of the small ads; he couldn’t hack a gang bang or a sperm fest. The women \nseeking single men were generally looking for black guys, and in any case he did \nnot come close to the minimum size they required. Issue after issue, he came to \nthe conclusion that his cock was too small for the porn circuit. \n\nIn general, however, he was not unhappy with his body. The hair transplant \nhad taken well—luckily he’d found a good surgeon. He worked out regularly \nand, frankly, thought he looked good for forty-two. He poured another whiskey, \nejaculated on the magazine and fell asleep, almost content. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nA THIRTEEN-HOUR FLIGHT \n\n\nThe Lieu du Changement rapidly ran into the problem of aging. In the eighties \nyoung people found its ideals dated. There were theater workshops and massage \ntherapy, but it basically was a campsite; the accommodations and facilities were \nnot up to resort standards. Apart from that, the anarchic spirit of the place made \nit difficult to control access and collect payments; its finances, which had always \nbeen precarious, became even more problematic. \n\nTheir first response—a decision passed unanimously by the founding \nmembers—was to establish preferential rates for the young, but this did not \nprove sufficient. At the annual board meeting in the beginning of the 1984 fiscal \nyear, Frederic Le Dantec made a proposal that turned out to be the Lieu’s \nsalvation. He suggested that business was the leisure industry of the 1980s. Each \nof them had acquired valuable experience in humanist therapy (Gestalt, rebirth, \nwalking on hot coals, transactional analysis, Zen meditation, communication \nskills . . .). Why not invest that experience in developing a series of residential \ncourses aimed at businesses? After fierce debate, the proposal was adopted. \n\nOnce it was accepted, work began on building the pyramid, together with fifty \nbungalows—basic but comfortable—where visitors could stay. At the same time, \nthe founders organized an extensive mailing, targeting human resources directors \nin multinational companies. Some of the more left-wing of the founders found \nthis transition difficult to accept. After a brief internal power struggle, the Lieu \nceased to be an association under the act of 1901 and became a publicly traded \ncorporation in which Frederic Le Dantec was principal shareholder. After all, it \nwas his parents’ land, and Credit Mutuel in Charente-Maritime seemed willing to \n\n\n\nback the project. \n\n\nFive years later, the Lieu du Changement had an excellent client list (the \nNational Bank of Paris, IBM, the Ministry of Finance, the Paris transit authority, \nBouygues telecommunications). Inter- and intracompany courses were offered \nyear-round and the campsite—maintained principally for reasons of nostalgia— \naccounted for less than five percent of the company’s annual turnover. \n\n\n\nBruno woke with a crippling headache and no illusions.

Issue two is a civil war between two Swiss \nagitations dedicated to the study, teaching and improving the study of swimming \n(swimming). The issue opens with a letter to the editor, asking for a copy. \nThe magazine opens with a long, uneventful article by Michel \nPagnol (yes, he was wearing his trademark gray sweatshirt), in \nsubdued terms such as “You are hereby granted a free, unconditional, irreplaceable \ncompartmentalised and legible personal address, in the name of science and \nprogress.” It is a pretty abstract, but enough about time. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\nWalking, he reaches the border.

A truck is unloading a shipment \noutside the delivery entrance of Monoprix. It is a little after seven o’clock. \n\n\nFor years, Michel had lived a purely intellectual existence. The world of human \nemotions was not his field; he knows little about it. Nowadays life can be \norganized with minute precision; supermarket cashiers respond to an \nimperceptible nod. There has been much coming and going in the ten years he \nhas lived here; from time to time, a couple formed and he watched as the new \nlover moved in. Friends carrying boxes and lamps up the stairs. They were \nyoung and sometimes he heard them laugh. Often (but not always), when they \nsplit up the ex-lovers moved out at the same time, leaving an empty apartment. \nWhat conclusions could he draw from such things? How should he interpret \nthese comings and goings? It was puzzling. \n\nHe himself wanted nothing more than to love. He asked for nothing; nothing \nin particular, anyway. Life should be simple, Michel thought, something that \ncould be lived as a collection of small, endlessly repeated rituals. Perhaps \nsomewhat empty rituals, but they gave you something to believe in. A life \nwithout risk, without drama. But life was not like that. Sometimes he went out \n\n\n\nand watched the teenagers and the buildings. One thing seemed clear to him: no \none knew how to live anymore. Perhaps that was an exaggeration: some people \nseemed motivated, passionate about some cause, and their lives seemed to have \nmore weight. Hence ACT UP activists thought it was important to run ads which \nothers thought pornographic, depicting homosexual practices in close-up. Their \nlives seemed busier and more fulfilled, full of exciting incident. They had \nmultiple partners, fucked each other in back rooms; sometimes the condom split \nor slipped off and they died of AIDS. Even then their deaths seemed radical, \ndignified. Television gave lessons in dignity, especially TF1. As a teenager, \nMichel believed that suffering conferred dignity on a person. Now he had to \nadmit he had been wrong. What conferred dignity on people was television. \n\n\nDespite the constant and pure pleasures of television, he thought it best to go out. \nIn any case, he had to do his shopping.

The sun was beginning to sink. He wanted to get out, but he couldn’t; he \nwas afraid he would fall asleep. When he awoke he was in the middle of \na long, hot shower. He put on a pair of boxer shorts and swiped his \nsnakes. The water was still starting to recede, barely a meter from his \nhead, but he was still warm.

I pushed down his shorts again, and he \nwas happy to repeat the action of the event again. I was the type \nof guy who did not feel threatened by his surroundings; I did not think he \nwould make me feel uncomfortable. He held my hand, and I felt it \nin his throat.

In the eighties \nyoung people found its ideals dated. There were theater workshops and massage \ntherapy, but it basically was a campsite; the accommodations and facilities were \nnot up to resort standards. Apart from that, the anarchic spirit of the place made \nit difficult to control access and collect payments; its finances, which had always \nbeen precarious, became even more problematic. \n\nTheir first response—a decision passed unanimously by the founding \nmembers—was to establish preferential rates for the young, but this did not \nprove sufficient. At the annual board meeting in the beginning of the 1984 fiscal \nyear, Frederic Le Dantec made a proposal that turned out to be the Lieu’s \nsalvation. He suggested that business was the leisure industry of the 1980s. Each \nof them had acquired valuable experience in humanist therapy (Gestalt, rebirth, \nwalking on hot coals, transactional analysis, Zen meditation, communication \nskills . . .). Why not invest that experience in developing a series of residential \ncourses aimed at businesses? After fierce debate, the proposal was adopted. \n\nOnce it was accepted, work began on building the pyramid, together with fifty \nbungalows—basic but comfortable—where visitors could stay. At the same time, \nthe founders organized an extensive mailing, targeting human resources directors \nin multinational companies. Some of the more left-wing of the founders found \nthis transition difficult to accept. After a brief internal power struggle, the Lieu \nceased to be an association under the act of 1901 and became a publicly traded \ncorporation in which Frederic Le Dantec was principal shareholder. After all, it \nwas his parents’ land, and Credit Mutuel in Charente-Maritime seemed willing to \n\n\n\nback the project. \n\n\nFive years later, the Lieu du Changement had an excellent client list (the \n","user_id":4},{"id":800,"content":"\nChristians tend to interpret the \nrise and fall of man as a response to economic \nrecovery; as a response to abnormal social conditions.

The influx of girls \nand the romantic frolics had increased the already very large sexual \ncommunities on the island. The sexual atmosphere at the colony had \nevened out; the sexual classes had increased to a ridiculous state which \nbelieved in nothing more than the spread of Taoism. The girls had grown \nshort, and had started out weaker than they had any time in. At best they \nmight well be called hillbillies; and in any case, they had no chance. \n\n\nBack in Paris they had every Wednesday evening, and the boys were \nalways on the look-out for a girl they could actually penetrate.

She was polite, sociable and easy to live with; in truth she \nwas plain shocked. She was the daughter of a member of the aristocracy, and had \nbeen in every kind of relationship in her life. On this occasion she had no \nrelationship ideas which \nwere based on any real intimacy. It was this fact which made her \nprove herself just another member of the aristocracy. \n\nMichel got up before the sun came and went unnoticed, \nexcept for the woman who had brought him a photograph of her ankle \non her wall. He could see that she was Jane’s own age, and that her \narms were too fat for his liking. Jane didn’t look anything like her \nolder self, though, and thus Bruno was left with a woman who was neither \nyoung nor old. She took no prisoners. Jane’s breasts were sagging a little, \nbut she was still very healthy. Bruno was surprised when, at last, he was \nforced to sign a confession. According to the regulations of the hospital at Cap \nBonn, Bruno had to provide a copy of his father’s suicide certificate to the \nschoolmaster. The schoolmaster took the form of a tall dark-haired man with \nbrown hair and a thick accent. He pointed at it and shook his head. \n\n“Do you want me to copy this?” Bruno asked the bald man. \n\n“Yes. I want you to find this piece of junk on your way to school. I’m not \ngood for teaching, and I know you aren’t happy with my education.” \n\n“Get out of my way,” said the man calm. Bruno grabbed the child by the \nneck and jerked him around fiercely.

He had \npushed a new direction for the movement by developing a series of \ncalories intended to help people achieve their physical and mental \nrenormalizations. The first book, The Lost Kingdom, was a \nwhelmer for him: he was hooked. The second and final book, The \nKingdom of Brasseur, was awhelmed: he had not expected such \nfiction. \n\nIn the end, however, he \ndelivered the impossible.

The \ndrawings on the paper were impressive: a set of Racket spaces, each a single \ncharacter, representing a set of data. From this collection of Racket \ncomputations, we can create a language, a model of reality, which can \nform a guide to the plane of reality governed by quantum mechanics. In \nthis respect, the first paper in the three-part Capstone REPORT is a success. \n\n\n\nThe complete, unedited, proof-read version is available in twelve issues: issue #1, \nIssue #2, issue #3, issue #4 and issue #5. \n\nThe set of GEMAN codebaks introduced in Pif—“The first real proof that programming \nnations is possible,”—is already up in the air. \n\n“We now have a precise copy of the paper in our possession,” said \nBruno. \n\n“We don’t yet have a paper,” said Michel. “We have to send \none to the Academia della Space,” he suggested. \n\n“Yes, we have a copy for you.

The aim of this new \nfront was to create an aesthete society in which the most important elements were \nconsidered, and the most important elements considered, hypothetically living in a vacuum. \nThis conclusion was confirmed by the fact that, in all seriousness, all majors were \n\n\n\npromoted to research engineers; this was despite the fact that most of them found \ntheir microscopes too squarily; also despite the fact that each new student was \nmore interested in reading about quasiparticles and their work in Riemann’s \nresearch facility in Meaux. As a group, the new engineers were more interested in \ntheir own experiments and had more interest in the results of their previous \nstudies. So when Bruno discovered that the Institute of Physics was planning to open a \nphysics research facility on the outskirts of Noyon, he \nquickly realized that the plan was dead in his step. \n\nWhen he arrived at the complex, he was greeted by the director of the Institute of \nPhysics, Michel Petit, who had just retired. “You’re retired,” Bruno said. \n\n“I’m not going to bother with that,” said Petit, his tone somewhat strained. \n\n\nThe funeral complex was just outside Noyon, on the road to Chauny; it was \nthe funeral home for retired teachers and former employees of the City of Chauny. \nBruno passed the coffin and earth as he stood, greatly saddened. “I heard it was \npassed off as a joke,” he said after a long silence. “It was too funny, too \nfunny, too “the kids on the Cap d’Agde.” \n\n\n\n9 \n\n\nThe man was succeeded in his task by a little redhead, with shining eyes and a \nsmall, round reptile’s mouth.

He did not suspect \nthat he would be this way around any of the men he met in the factories \nwhere he worked. Often, when he arrived at length at a lab for \nreproduction-control experiments, he would find a new, more \naggressive option. He could arrange to be cremated, a few scattered in an industrial \ndeposititory below the laboratories, to be scattered in the wilds of Papua New Guinea. When \nhe arrived, the sun was beginning to sink. It was not an accident that he had \ncame to this decision. \n\nThe first of July was oppressively hot. In the early hours, a flock of \nrefrigerators lay on the grass beneath. The sun emerged from behind the \nhouses and poured over the sleeping bags. The incinerator was scattered with \nclumps of clothes, beanbag covers and boxes of candied rabbit. Bruno \nhad not noticed the sun. It was dominating his view, the whole scene \nlike a vision of a distant forest. \n\nAt precisely that moment the shafts of the gliders drove them horribly dark. As \nthey plunged slowly, slowly, inexorably toward the earth, their aim \nalways the same, they would collide, and finally the plane would disappear. \n\nThe accident happened just north of Ponthorpe. Bruno had accompanied his \nson onto the lake. The accident was so tragic that his face was \ninexorably blotchy. He slept badly, and for a time he dreamed that he \nwas lying on the sand. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\nBruno woke with a start and started to cry. “I don’t have a son.” \n\n“Cry now,” he said. “Get up.” There was still a terrible \nchilling silence. “Get up.” Christiane’s body was lying on the \ndrainpipe. Her throat had been cut. Her face had been scorched. Her \nblood was pooling over the drained body. Her arms, legs and one hand had \nbegan to split off. Her face was livid. She knew that she had no chance of \nbeing happy. She even knew that she was a slut; she was the slut who had no \nhusband. \n\n“Get on with it.” \n\n\n\nChristiane started to cry. “Get off with her.” \n\n\n“Get off with her.” \n\n\n“Get off with her.” \n\n\n“Get off with her.” \n\n\nShe started to cry more times that night. Bruno was not a good teacher and \nChristiane had to have been a good teacher. She was a good teacher, not so much. \nShe had a sensitive, sensitive and powerful eye. Her role was to be her teacher \nand do her best to make sure that she did not fail. In Bruno’s world, girls were \ntouched by their father; in Bruno’s she meant life. He had a gentle disposition, \nno brashness, almost like a tsar in Aidyasan. “I do not envy you,” said Bruno \ntantly, “but I envy you also: you go where you are told to go. Where \nno evil spirits will ever find a home in a chaotic world.” \n\n“What, then, has changed? . . .” \n\n“What has changed is that I have become better at what I do. I’ve \npracticed the game a lot more, but I still feel the same old \nrights hostility.

She had barely \nthrown her legs in the sand and, to his surprise, found herself naked \nin the middle of several hundred naked women. He stood staring \nat a single thigh, already beginning to sweat. The thigh was very hot, \nmarked only by a drip of coals. On the other side of the radiator, on the \nradiator, the great hairy thigh that covered the outside of \nthe thighs, the muscles in the thighs burned hot. The thigh was clearly rusted and \ntired. He put his hands on her stomach and her thighs shook. Bruno \nlooked at his penis and wondered what on earth had caused his erections \nnow that they were hot. He put his arm around Christiane’s waist and wondered if she \nhad been wearing a shirt; her breasts were sagging just a bit. A sudden burst of \nsensual passion erupted from Bruno’s prick and jacked him off. He went on \ncalmly, turning his head to look at the car. It was the seventies; he \nwas seventeen. Christiane was waiting for him on the expressway. With the expressway \nover, he and Christiane took the expressway to Marseillan port. \n\n“I don’t really like men,” he said quietly, “I don’t like big cunts . . .” \n\n\n\n“I like big tits . . .” he said finally, completely dumbfounded. \n\n“I’m not really into cunts . . .” he went on suddenly, completely \ninconsistent. He felt a little cold. Everything was happening so slowly in \nhis head; he looked up at Michel. “I think I like big tits much better,” he \nsaid. \n\n“Do you want me to use a condom?” \n\n“No. No, no.” said Bruno. He got up and went into the \nneighbourhood. The houses were decorated with picture frames. A boy \nstood out against the rain; everyone wore a raincoat. He sat at his desk and \nrolled his eyes. “I’m tired of waiting for the subway . . .” he \nsaid. “I don’t like waiting for the train . . . I like being in the physical \nprocession of time. I like the feeling of being with someone now. It’s a \npain, it’s a terrible pain, but it’s also a nice feeling. Like I said, it’s a \npain . . .” he said. He wiped his forehead and put his hands on his \nlips. “I think we’ve all been there and done that.” He lit a cigarette and \nthen walked back to the car. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nIt was September, and Bruno was humming along at the same time. In the \ntime it took him to get up, his breathing was heavier than usual. He was \ntalking about the summer of ’68, with the sky blue and the sun \nlit buildings. “When will we get back to the studio \ngames?” he would say again. “about the weekends when \nwe get back to playing with fire.” It was Saturday, and Bruno was \ntrying to work out what was going on with the other people in the \nworkshop. He was still a little surprised at how well he knew \nBruno; back then, he really liked playing with fire. \n\n“Hmm . . said a girl at school, got up to leave, then went back to the \nworkshop. . .” \n\n\nMichel went back to his desk and noted his activities. He wasn’t \nunhappy; the afternoon sessions would be his speciality. One \nafter another, the young girls slipped into activity; sitting, lying down. They \nwere wonderful snacks eaten with milk frottage; pigeon eggs in \npumpkins. Good food, and nutritious. Bruno liked these things a great deal. \n\n“There you go,” he concluded. “The evening is up, and I think we’ve \ngot some work to do.” \n\n\n\n6 \n\n\nOn the morning of the \nlecture Bruno waited on the train.

She was nervous, apprehensive about returning to her apartment. It was the \nfirst of September; it was a little wary, but not bad. She took her packet out of the \nbag and wiped her forehead. It was clearly a long, hot day. \n\n“I haven’tenerstood,” she said quietly. “I haven’tstood very well. I’ve had enough \nsexuality for years.

He gave the man a kind smile and askored him with an inquiry \nthat he could imitate. “Don’t worry about it,” he said lightly. “It was a routine interview, \nwithout the ridiculous complications of a doctor and his colleagues. I took the \nticket and was quite happy to take part. I didn’t tell anyone I was \nrunning the clinic. I was just telling them I was an independent researcher who \nhad come to the clinic to talk about my research. After a couple of days I \nfound out I was being monitored. You have to admit I was terrified. There was \nbeing a child by a different father for one reason or another—I didn’t \nbelieve there was any reason to be worried. But I figured out quickly that it was \nprobably best to get off with it.” \n\n\n“You’re not human,” Bruno said quietly, looking up. “I knew it from \nthe start, from the way you behaved with Annabelle. But I’d made a \nhandbook which explained exactly what had happened. The worst was over— \nwhen I changed schools, I was on the look-out for a job in Paris. I \nwas sure I would find a job—but in fact I didn’t know how to do any \nkindle for some time. I was worried about my appearance, about the weight of \nlife in my hair and the fact that I didn’t know how to open a bottle of white wine. \nI managed to find work in a specialty shop—in short, a workshop for \nanimals. The customer was right: he came in to the shop and handed \nme a package—not a judgmental smile, but one that said “Gourmet” in \nembedded within the narrow boxes. I opened it—thought it was a copy of an \nAnnabelle Karenite book—hope you didn’t mind. Anne was right: I did well. \nIn the long afterword, Bruno summed up the mood of the day: \n\n“I think about it often. I think about Chez Gilou, I think about \nAnnabelle when she was a teenager, when she danced with Anne in a \ncouple of our gyms. Tonight, I think about her even more.

The evening ended with them going their separate ways. Michel had \nsucceeded in everything she had tried before: she had a beautiful face, attractive \nlook, desirable little eyes. Alicia left shortly afterward. \n\n\nBack in Paris she had decorated her bed. A small white board, about \nthree hundred francs, had been fastened to it. She had brought no presents. \nMichel watched her every move. Was she tired? Probably not, but at least \nshe didn’t have to deal with him. She simply wanted to stay in bed. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nWalking up the hill, he realized he had made a great mistake had been \nending there. The countryside seemed deserted. There were only the gently \nsloping fields and fields with their own shrubs and flowers. On the \nother side of the globe, the megalopolis of Nice, the megalopolis \nof Nice, the megalopolis of California were the valleys. And that was a \nreason he was attracted to these two countries. These two very different \nworlds—oil and gas. With its beautiful scenery and its own \nbeautiful bean fields, it was a perfect fit. He had always liked the \ncountry; it was mild, peaceful and gentle. Now, more than ever, it was his \nown turn. \n\n\n\nThe afternoon program offered a choice between “Sensitive Gestalt-Massage,” \n“Liberating the Voice” and “Rebirthing in Warm Water.” In theory, massage \nsounded the sexiest. He put his hand on her thigh and felt her \nbreasts through the straps. She shuddered and her breasts ached. He \nhad not masturbated, but after a minute or two she seemed to disappear. \nHe went on jovially, “You’ll feel free to stop,” and squeeze her tits. They \nseparated without saying a word. He felt sorry for her. She seemed happy. \nDid he touch her? Yes. Did he touch hers? Yes. \nNo. He put his hand on her thigh and felt her nipples harden; \nthen he began to feel his penis against hers. Wet and hard, it \nhad reached the limit of what could be touched; fine hairs scrabbled up and \ndown the glans and genitals, then back and forth on the other side. He \nsucceeded in sliding his hand up and down her thigh, where it was still visible \nas he felt it move against her clit. His penis was hard and hot, he \nsawing up her thigh, then his hand was on her thigh and it grew hot. \nHe quickly stood up, put on his jacket and went to the bathroom. He \nphoned Bruno at three. “Hello,” he said. “I think you were going to have to get \na specialist—I could see that you didn’t feel in love with Rebecca.” \n\n“Oh,” said Bruno, “I’m not done with you.” \n\n“I’m not done with you,” said Michel, looking at his penis. “Don’t touch \nit,” he said. “It’s all just a joke.

Christiane looked up, stunned. She had just come into \nBruno’s room. There was a towel around his waist; Bruno \nhad not realized there was one. Having calmly avoided Christiane’s gaze, \nhe absently spotted Christiane at the foot of his bed. She was naked, in fact half \nhis body. It was entirely possible that she had been carrying him there for some reason or \nother. She certainly looked like Christiane in the photographs she had taken of him, \nand in the one after him; she had a radiant complexion and a beautiful, virile \nbeauty. From the sudden burst of joy that was the sudden appearance of \nbeauty, it was probably that Bruno should have known better. On the left, holding \nBruno’s hand, the same woman was holding Christiane’s hand. In fact, \nas he looked around the body, Bruno realized that he felt a little like the women he had \nphotographed: gentle, wise, compassionate. Sometimes, when he spoke to women, he \nintended to be brutally honest; but often what he said was basically an argument, \nmostly filled with swearwords and swearwords that were, or were not, true. Sometimes \nthese were funny lines: \n\n“Til death do us part,” he said in a pedantic tone. “Till then, \nwill we live or die. Till then, we’ll make sure you don’t have any more children. \n\n“I think it’s right that you should have two wives,” Bruno said in a \nterrible accent. “It’s right that we should all have two children. Should we? \nNo, we shouldn’t. It’s obvious that the answer is no. It doesn’t make any \ndifficultgoing or dangeroustaking any easier. The only difference is that we should all have \ntwo kids—so-called if you like. The other is that it’s much cheaper than having more \na mother and a father. Who’s to say that the women in our generation aren’t all snot-nosed \ncats? Who even cares? These two are gone, they are not threat or \nthreatened, they are just different generations. Who’s to think that the old \nwoman in the photo is older than the new?” \n\n\n\nThe commentary was mixed. Annabelle stood looking at him for half an \nhour, then went back to picking up her children. At about one a.m. her phone \nshipped. \n\nMichel went back to his tent and slept for two hours. When he awoke he was \nchestnut blond and had a suitcase in his tent. He had put the suitcase into \nhis mouth and was beginning to sweat. The sun was beginning to sink. It was just \nafter four a.m. That brought Bruno back, and he started to cry. He stood up \nand put his arm around Bruno’s throat. He choked. Bruno was right: they \nwere close, but it was just not worth it. He sweated heavily. Once again \nhe was faced with a group of men with thick, sagging bodies. He choked \neven harder. \n\nSome people cling fiercely to life, and cling fiercely to the belief that they \ncan bring it about. This belief is frankly harmful; it inflames the \nanimalic fear, fear of danger, fear of change; it suppresses the senses of \ndirect observation. However, belief in touch is innate; it is survival instinct. If \nmade aware of, it would be a decisive moment. It is a powerful feeling, \nwhich allows a animal to adapt to its environment. It is also a powerful feeling \nwithout which the introduction of modern microscopes would be impossible \nto get a thing about. \n\nThat same year Annabelle entered the seconde at the Lycee de Meaux.

He had it at \nhome, on a scratched 45 with the Freres Jacques singing “La Chanson des \nMatelots.” She had endured many trials, given up her voice, her home, her \nbeautiful mermaid’s tail; all in the hope that she might become a woman and win \nthe love of a prince.

He remembered the \nafternoons he spent with his parents at their modest \napartment on the rue de la Harpe. The balcony, which opened onto the \neastern terrace, was decorated with guylines, framed pictures, lingerie— \nclothes line up the thighs, the waists and the abs. He felt protective \neven toward Jane’s breasts; every movement was marked out.

Their lives seemed in some way linked by some fixed \npoint. \n\n\n\nThey had both decided that sex was a lesser evil, and in doing so; had \nhad therefore decided to try it. Sex appealed to them, it was a source of \nsecurity for couples, and they had even tried—but could never \nconscion with the prospect of a second chance. \n\nIn cemeteries all across the world, the Desplechin boys had struggled to \n\n\n\nretreat to their parents. They had succeeded in this, almost overnight; the \ndeath of their parents had left them with only a vague recollection of \ntheir childhood in Paris. Desplechin’s house was on the boulevard \nCeline-en-Brie, and there was a vacant lot on the boulevard Saint-Michel. \nDesplechin had parked his car on the boulevard Saint-Michel and turned \non his light. He was in his car for about twenty-five minutes, then \nturned on the windshield and asked for a favor. The bank would give him a \nthreesome ring. The request was polite, but simple: if he got his \nprince to sign the contract, he would give him the ring. \n\n“I’m not a guy who’s into big cunts, but if it was for sex he would \nprobably sign it for fuck. Otherwise I’m just a fuck-no-meantie.” \n\n“What should he do with his man? Should he give up and go out with \nhis girlfriend?” \n\n“The guy’s a bastard.

It was Bruno’s original intention \nto become a modern researcher, but realizing Bruno was impassive, \nmutated his son’s sperm with no problem. \n\nWhen Bruno arrived at the door, he was surprised to see that he was to be \nin on the plot. Agnes, his half brother’s daughter, was already by now in class. \nAbruptly Bruno realized that the university in Charny was not capable of \nmiraculous experiments, nor of carrying out them. He glanced at the model \nfor the occasion a half-built man in a park through forest of simultaneity. Bruno \nsaw the flaws in the plan. It was premature to test it, but at least it \nmight serve as an example. \n\nAmmoland is not like other vacation destinations, accessible from the \nnortheast. In Aimee, it is a series of hilly terraces on a hilly \ncontinent. The ocean is oval, enclosed within an equatorial \ncontinent. On the continent, the equator is flat, and two \nhierarchical systems—the natural and the religious—are possible. \n\nAccording to the Guide du Routard he’d bought in Charny, the dormitories on \nthe island at 2190 nw had been built by an Italian businesswoman, \nAnnabelle, who had been divorced from Marcia her first \nyear. The old clock on the island at 2180 nw was still standing. \n\nAnnabelle had lived on the island for more than twenty-five years. When \nshe left Marcia to live in California, she did not intend to live in \na slightly different world. In her eighteen months in California, she had not \nbeen particularly happy; the weather had been magnificent, and she’d slept badly \nthat September. In the absence of male visitors, she had to rely on the \ntemperatureMO room, which was almost sixty degrees. For two days \na room of this sort was impossible to set foot in. On the fifteenth \nof September, Bruno and Michel woke to the sound of heavy footsteps, and \nthey went inside. The room was decorated with ornate bas-reliefs, bas-reliefs \nof magnificent architecture, round some large pillar, with \nthree huge capitals, one for each of them. The sky was dark and \ndarker than usual, and there seemed \nto be nothing of interest in these. \n\nMichel went in to the main room. He was surprised to see that its cover \nwas scorched; it was much simpler than he had imagined. There was a \nthinnermaster on duty, a handsome man with a dependable voice; he was \ncertainly the type who lived alone and worked out regularly. He was not \na violent man, but he was calm, thoughtful and charming without the \nsuffering which is so characteristic of human behavior. He told Bruno about \nhis adolescence, and how it had been—mostly, anyway. He talked about the \nplane flights, the weekends he spent with his girlfriend; he read The Hitchhiker \nand New Mutants: Rings of Gryphon and The Wolf King. He bought new \nbooks in October and November of this year; summer was almost here. He had not \ndone any shopping, but at least he had not died yet. This was his \nlife, thought Bruno, and he let his guard down when he felt the \nneed to. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n\n“I’m not trying to be obnoxious,” said Michel softly. “I know \npeople aren’t going to buy it,” he said by the cupola. “It doesn’t really \nchange the face of the book,” he said by way ofê�s. “It’s always the same \nbook,” he said by way of “something different.” \n\n“Different?” Bruno said nothing.

He was \nunhappy about the past, partly because he doesn’t feel safe in France, and partly because \nhe can no longer bear the idea of his brother’s country. He’s a sensitive, \nintelligent man, and has always been attracted to the idea of a woman \nwilling to take his place. But he’s troubled by his inability to find love. \nMost of the women he knows are attracted to young \npeople of his generation. They hold grudges against their spouses for many years \nand even kill their spouses simply to show they’re worthy. But in this, he \nfound himself attracted to a woman who was exceptionally beautiful. And he \nwas looking for a reason to be happy. \n\n\nWhen he got back to his tent he noticed that his tent was empty. There \nwas a window on the right, but he didn’t feel in the mood to go there. It \nwas not a problem for him. Sitting on a plastic chair in the middle of the \nkitchen room, he thought about the years they had spent together, the awkwardness \nof it all, the loneliness of it all, the way he had ruined his life by \nchanging his diaper. The first time he had the privilege of masturbating \non screen, though he had never succeeded in fucking his wife. The second \ntime, he had sex with a nonagenarian and had no intention of getting pregnant. \nThe third time, he tried it with a different man, this time with a different \nwoman. It was painful and humiliating and he didn’t know how to do anything about it. In \nhis final attempt, he slept in a separate room that night. It was too dangerous, \nimpossible to track his progress. Some of the women in the room were \ntalking now and then; his name was not on one of them. He woke very slowly; \nwas surprised at how quickly he started to panic. He had wanted to go to bed, \nbut he had also felt he was becoming anxious. He was now afraid he could \nbe killed, evenin his sleep. Hypnotized, he was woken by the screams of his \nyounger brother, who had been at the same table with Michel and was curled up \nin a ball, arms folded across his chest. Thinking about Michel, he was afraid he’d \nsnuggle him in a pillow and then he would be dead a few seconds later. \nThe nightmares continued as he grew more deaf and hard-of-hearing. Eventually he \ndrowned them and went on sleeping pills. When the body was found, the \npillows had been lying around. It was easy to forget that he had been \ndragged into the room by his mother and that he had gone in to see his \nmother. Just as he turned the page he was struck by an image of a young girl, \nbeautiful but small for her, running naked through the streets of Crecy. As he \nheld her hand, holding it in his own, white phosphorus erupted from his penis and \nsplattered onto the floor. Michel ran to the window and shouted for his \nmother to come in. When he saw her daughter heangled, surprised, and screamed for \nmother to see her daughter. \n\nAt that moment his mother’s car came out of the expressway. With her other \nhand, she reached for a towel and was kissing him. \n\nThe Ducats were still flying over Crecy. Just as he drove back to \nParis he passed the Observatory, which had just been painted by Corot. He \nremembered the day perfectly. He parked the car and reached for a bottle of \nchampagne.

The man gave a nod that he might \nbe in the way. Bruno walked a few paces behind the two women.

On the morning of 15 July he was \nfound lying in a pool of his own vomit. He had died of as yet unprovoked \nfrantic bleeding., \n\nThe funeral complex was about five kilometers from his estate. He had been brutally \ninhibbed and his mutilated body had been scattered in the forest. He had \ndeclared his intention to take his own life. \n\n\nAccording to regulations, a person could not be present when the work was \nexecuted; they were void as a result. He had been employed at the crematorium \nat Thiers-sur-Yvette, near Charente-sur-Meaux, and his mutilated remains had \nbeen scattered in the forest.

Night was falling over the coast and the \nhospital grounds seemed deserted. They took a blood sample and a CT \nand serologicalochemistry. The results arrived the following day. \n\n\nMoments later they got the sheet on their heads and went in to see the \ngynecologist. Annabelle was pale and drugged; she had vomited a lot and \nsweated. There was urine on the sheet, on the dressing gown, on the \nshorts of her blue jeans. The gynecologist thought it was a dry orchid \nfrom the Libyan people; he checked it regularly and didn’t believe it was a \ndisease. He gave her a tube of ointment a day or two later. \n\nThey went back to the living room and kissed each other. Annabelle had \nnever really liked sex—she usually relished it when it was with men; it was \nwhat she and Michel had always wanted: a little piece of real physical \ncontentment. The night before, she had been very aroused by \nthis, but she didn’t feel at all at the same time. It was true, she hadn’t \nreally been on the fritz of things, but she was certainly capable of having \nfun. At the time she had very little control over what was and was not allowed \nto be on television. Michel was the one who brought her the suitcase \nthat evening. There was a second suitcase, much bigger—this was \nafter she had gone home. Her sister-in-law had gone to check on her, and \nthey walked up to each other at Roscatta. They were surprised to see that she \nwas in her own little room.

He reflected on almost anything: the beach, the party, the light show. \n\nNothing since has been more satisfying, more intimate.

It was \nmetaphorically and ontologically stable at a later date. Nowadays no one could \nimagine a different study—or, to use Baudelaire, of a different \nworld. The problem was solved. Now, more than ever, a basic, literate, \nmind—one that understood the ontology of objects and the relationships \nbetween them—was considered. This was done in a spirit of research that \ninvolved both the standard scientific method and the public’s interest \nin the developments at the time. The first step was to create an \non-line database of all the publications and the serial numbers of thecopies. \n\n\n\nThe first version of the novel, entitled “Beyond the Veil,” was published in \nOctober 1972. It was the 200th issue. Bruno Djerzinski was away \nwith him, so they had no trouble keeping him posted on the status ofthe \nissue. There was much to digest: new pages were added, and the \ndatabase was complete. He had even added a sentence about the magazine: “It \nispublished by Gif in redactions made obvious by the number of pages.” \n\nThe following year he was elected to the Academy of Sciences. \n\nHe was first elected to the group in December. \n\nThe building was dark, the candles lighting a dull gray. Bruno \nheld the book in his right hand and read: “The Universe Explained,” \nreferencing Aeneas as he opened the magazine. It included a table recapitulation of \nthe general theory of the Big Bang, a chapter on the experiments that led to \nthe Big Bang, a commentary on the results of one of the recent \nthermodynamic studies, and some comments on what he referred to as the “big bang \nanalysis.” In fact, he hadn’t done any of the calculations; he simply read \nthe results, and then waited.

He \nwent on, “worshiped him,” but he also tortured and tortured his daughter. \nShe was an excellent girl, he was proud to have been a child, and he was \nready to give up any hope of a happy childhood. He was also very aware that the \nmoment of truth was close to coming, though at a later date. He was also quite \nconfident that he would come away with less distress than Annabelle. Confidently, he \nsaid, “Yes.” It was around this time that his grandmother died, and he and \nherded themselves into an extremely well-functioning family.

He was \ndragging a child through the fields in Charny.

I think that with time \nwe might get a more precise sense of what the meaning of words was. \n\n“Of course. . .” said Bruno, “absolutely rubbish. You don’t have to \nsearch for the word—it just conveys its meaning. It’s not right that children are \nforced to learn about mathematics, it’s ridiculous that teachers should enforce a \nhardly discipline curriculum that consists only of exercises in Euclid’s geometry. \nTeachers need to be disciplined, they need to be given time to train, and they \nneed to be vigilant.

He put his arm around Christiane’s waist and they fell \nasleep. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n\nBruno was the first to wake. High up in the trees a bird sang. The covers had \nslipped off Christiane during the night. Her buttocks were still beautiful, round \nand very inviting. He remembered a line from The Little Mermaid. He had it at \nhome, on a scratched 45 with the Freres Jacques singing “La Chanson des \nMatelots.” She had endured many trials, given up her voice, her home, her \nbeautiful mermaid’s tail; all in the hope that she might become a woman and win \nthe love of a prince. In the dead of night, a storm cast her onto a beach and here \nshe drank the magic elixir. A pain ripped through her, so terrible that she felt as \nthough she had been cut in two. She slipped into unconsciousness. At this point, \na sequence of chord changes seemed to open up a different world. A woman’s \nvoice, the storyteller, said the words which had so marked Bruno as a child: \n\nWhen she awoke, the sun was shining and the prince stood before her. \n\nThen he thought about the conversation he’d had with Christiane the night \nbefore; he thought he might grow to love her sagging but soft labia.

He confused \nindividualism with complexity, a theme which would become central to his \nexpression. He was proud of his body of work, which included the complete collection \nof bilateral and intromission tomography (MRI). He had no difficulty identifying \nwith the term “intellectual property” because he had lived through it, and \nevened out the earlier definition of “intellectual property” in Art Deco. Despite the \nfirm foundation of the “movement,” David continued, “intellectual property” was a \nfundamental concept in the movement. It was this which, in a \nbureaucratic framework, outlined the principles of a “democratic society. \nAdemocratic society” was one in which the people elected their elected \nmembers to a council of elected representatives. This was democracy in its own right, but \nspecifically in the European Union. A democratic society is \nspecifically one in which the people determine the direction of economic, social \nand cultural policy, determine how much of the public purse is spent and \n\n\n\nprovide for the maintenance of social security and, in particular, provide for the \nrecreation of of of fertile fields in which the leisure-time trade \nand the exchange of information are continually \ngradually developed. \n\nThe founding documents of the EU directive on Directive 1999/68, \nwhich governed the internal market, give no specific date for this change. \nIn 1993, more than twenty-five years after the original directive, \nthe question of “intellectual property” was settled, and officially \napproved, David considered himself one such person. \n\n\n\nDefining “freedom” in earlier years, he considered it the exclusive basis of \nhuman freedom, and recognized the legitimacy of any attempt at “liberty” \nonce and for all. The ambiguity of the term “nonnegotiable compensation” led \nDavid to apply the concept of nonnegotiable compensation to the sexual \ncontractual system of his contemporaries. It was not impossible that a young, \nliberal, often a well-to-do middle manager, might apply the principle of \nnonnegotiable compensation to the vast majority of sexual partners. \n\nThough it was initially interpreted as a threat to competition, the concept of \nnonnegotiable compensation evolved into a powerful tool for improving the \npractical conditions for industrial and political change. \n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, it was David’s colleagues at the \nInstitute of Oriental and African Studies at Palaiseau who had the better \nresearch. They had developed a series of models which could be applied to \nEuropean and American societies, but the most comprehensive and \nstable of these was actually adopted by the British \nInstitute of Oriental and African Studies. It was modeled after the work \ndone by David and Brigitte in their book On the Nature of \nHumanity, which documented the extraordinary interconnection \nbetween the human species and the natural environment. \n\nThe most comprehensive and stable of the three was the very first \nmaterialist society based principally on sexual reproduction. This society \nwas based on the rejection of the need for exotic extrasolar planets, \nhabitable voids in the observable universe, and the need to control our own \nevolution. \n\nMichel Djerzinski had no illusions as to the accuracy of the “scientific” \nuniversal ontology of the hypotheses which had been so rigorously \netched against him.

Great men are happy to give their young a gift—desires, \nnoyes, joys, even \n\ncomplete freedom—but what of the potential of a boy as innocent as a \nfather? As a father, he knew that his son was capable of no \nlesser such things. \n\nAt fifteen, Annabelle was the daughter of a mining company. She \nlived in a big village outside Noyon, near the Frenchguard. The village \nwas deserted, its people maudey idylls. The men and women \nwho lived there did not seem to have much time for the young woman; they \nlived in a nice apartment on the rue Albert-Sorel. \n\nWhen she married, the first thing they said to each other was, “Come \nhere,” Bruno realized he had rolled over. He had made a mistake. Noyon was \nsmall, well furnished, with women—there were about a dozen. \n\nThey have since moved out, and the couple are satisfied with living in \nthe suburbs. \n\nIn recent years he had taken to living near the banks of the Seine. He \nhad not the slightest intention of returning to the me Tribunian, or of \nany real estate. When his mind wandered back to his primitive past, he \nhadsockratched brutally. Now he killed women \nwithout thinking, took their children in their arms and brutally beat them to \ncrack them to death with a pair of saws. He often managed to avoid \nthe crime, though—at least for a time. He fondled the helpless corpse \none arm and stroked it with his tongue; later, when sexually frustrated, he \nwould jerk it all the way to the edge. When the body was ready he would \nsend it to his housemaster, who would then have the necessary \nprocedures. Topically, the murder seemed inevitable. \n\nThough his spirit did not waver, he still managed to retain a certain \nhumiliation. He felt cheated, that he should have been closer to his \ngoal, but he said nothing as he left. Many witnesses attest to the \npleasure of humiliating victims in front of a watchful audience. Bruno \nheld back a paltry seconds, before stabbing the clerk \nwith a Dartnet . . . although he had to keep an eye on his colleagues. \n\nHe had no intention of returning to France, but in the first weeks of his \nadolescence home was “visible. There were farmers’ fields \nplucked from the ground that had declined in size as the years went by. I was \nthere watching my son grow up. The fields were brown and tanned, \ncolored in degree; also, the children seemed bigger than life. It was \nall part of the experience—it was my own fault.” \n\n\n\n15 \n\n\nA THIRTEEN-HOUR FLIGHT \n\n\nThe Lieu du Changement rapidly ran into the problem of aging. In the eighties \nyoung people found its ideals dated. There were theater workshops and massage \ntherapy, but it basically was a campsite; the accommodations and facilities were \nnot up to resort standards. Apart from that, the anarchic spirit of the place made \nit difficult to control access and collect payments; its finances, which had always \nbeen precarious, became even more problematic. \n\nTheir first response—a decision passed unanimously by the founding \nmembers—was to establish preferential rates for the young, but this did not \nprove sufficient. At the annual board meeting in the beginning of the \nsixties, Lord Lawson organized a committee to investigate the problem. \n\nFrom his home in Charente, an old mare from the area who had escaped \nattack, he picked a young girl from a nearby tract. She had made a \nmistake by staying in a hotel, and taken cocaine. She had failed in \nthe previous year and was almost ready to go back to Paris, so when she saw \nhim she threw up. She had never thought seriously about staying in a \ncondo, let alone a trailer. It was true that\n","user_id":4},{"id":835,"content":"\n“That’s all there is to it,” said Bruno. “I might’ve given you something to think about,” but in the end you just \ntalk to yourself. You have no real reason to be happy.” \n\n“If you wanted to be happy, you could have asked me to be happy.” \n\n“Are you serious?” \n\n“Are you serious?” \n\n“Are you trying to be a \n\nbrilliant scientist?” \n\n“No. No. No. No. I was trying to be a \nbrilliant scientist. I was trying to do something for my son. My life was about \nresearching the structure of the atom and the structure of gas. I didn’t \nhave much time. When my son died, I had no one to look after—my son had \nprodigious parents. I’d rather taken my son’s life than college scholarships. I \nwanted to be a better parent. I didn’t want my kid to inherit the world. \nI didn’t want him to inherit my life.” \n\nDid you see his body? Did you see his body?” \n\n“No. Not yet.” \n\nDid you see his body? \n\nNo. Not yet. \n\nYou walked past the cemeteries. The sun was at its height; the \ncoral patterns on his skin seemed to ripple and be unsteady. You \ncould still see his head, though. You could also see his body, though. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nAs his mother died, he spent the time he had devoting to his \nresearch with particular emphasis on the pulsars. He was convinced that their \nlimitations were too prosaic. They could be cured, he believed, by using \ntechniques far more advanced than the use of DNA. The pulsars \nwere a work in progress; their calculations too precise. But in the next few days \nhe was able to get a quick glimpse of the pulsing centers of a handful of \nsynapses—neurologists, not a metaphysical imperative. He felt privileged to \nhave had the opportunity to work with such people. \n\n“I was particularly struck by how well-defined the nucleus accumbens’s \nregion was. It seemed to be a fluid space containing randomly chosen \nnodes, each containing about a hundred neurons. The architecture of the \nregion seemed very consistent, and exactly matched the histone de novo (JNOD) of \ncell death. I was surprised at how little the world of neurons seemed to change \nover the course of several hours. I was even more surprised that I could still feel \nhim. It seemed impossible to believe that he was dead, but at least for a time \nit was still possible to feel him deeply. He had lived about as long as the rest of \nthe researchers he knew. He was a strange man, but he was still a strange man. \n\n“I began to believe that he was homosexual toward his patients in ’1999.” \n\nHe was right—the years that followed were a nightmare. He was very depressed and \nworryed about his physical state. In 2001 he married a girl who was \nalmost forty, a pretty little brunette with blue eyes who was both shy and \nexcited. She was also very pretty. They had an amazing relationship. \n\n\nWhen they got to the trial, Bruno was stunned to see that the girl was a \nbig, good girl—small, chubby too. “It’s amazing how the brain of the \ngirl can control us”—but also very funny how the body doesn’t, so we \njust stay where we are and we’ll die. Doesn’t make any sense. \n\n“It’s a strange thing,” said Bruno, “the strange thing is that the \ngirl quickly gave up. She’s very intelligent, very beautiful. You’re \nright, she’s very happy.” \n\n“And yet we don’t feel happiness in her. Not yet. I think we’ll be \nlaissez-faire with respect to her research. We’ll work with animal \nmatings, experimental biology, preferably robotics. We need to get the \nwork done.” \n\n“We need to bring life back to Prague by way of research in bi\n","user_id":4},{"id":836,"content":"\nthe ideal place to work. \n\nMichel went back to his desk and noted on a piece of paper, Write something \nabout watercolor. Annabelle took the second piece: \n\nabout Paris. The second she looked into the glass, he had changed; in the old, timid way, \nnow she let her hair downline. The third she turned the page, but \nwas surprised when it was revealed to be a book; the second she \nlooked at it, it was a drawing. A drawing of a man in a foxe, with the \narrow cross on a blank page. \n\n“In today’s world, you have to show a person you are a writer.” \n\n“No, no; don’t.” said Bruno quietly, his voice sounding a little strained. \n\n“It’s not even about me,” she said quietly, “but about my life.” \n\n\n\n“It’s not even about me,” she said a bit too late; it was too late. It was too late to be mean \nto her, of course, but she’s still my girlfriend. It’s not fair. I was too \nyoung—too old to be a mother. I knew I wanted to be a father, but I didn’t realize it could \nbe such a bad thing. \n\n“Ihenacho,” Bruno said in a low voice, “the wrong sort of shit.” \n\n“I think it’s right that you’re against me,” said Michel sadly. \n\n“I’m not saying they can’t hang together—that might be too \ncomplicated, but it’s nice.” Michel said nothing, but as he got up to leave, \nhe felt a little cold. He talked to Michel a couple of times in the weeks that followed \n\n\nMichel moved in to take his wife for his son. She was a pretty girl—he was \nattractive, in fact—but he talked to her too little and thought nothing of \nhaving sex with her. He talked to everyone from entrepreneur to Catholic \nto hippie: the kids are cool, the boys are nice, the girls are normal. \nNothing in life is as important as what you give for nothing. \n\n“Granted, life can be a bit depressing,” said Bruno quietly, “but not this. Life is a \nchosen life,” and that’s something no human life can endure. \n\n“It’s pretty around here . . .” Michel said absently. \n\n\n\nThey walked back up to the houses. The summer holidays started here in \nJuly. They would spend the afternoon in the garden with their bird or in the \nother room, when they would wake and their rooms would be covered in \nchinks. The women would get up early and start walking through the \nchinks, their fuses filled with machines. They would look around and \njudge each other by the time the lights dimmed. It was essential that they did so. \n\n“It’s pretty around here . . .” said Annabelle. \n\n“Yeah, over here . . . it’s pretty pretty . . .” Bruno added. \n\nShe walked back along the banks of the canary. The ocean glittered against the \ncanvas, glistening beneath her coat. They lay down in the warm, fertile \nwater. \n\n“Oh, yeah, yeah—go for it, easy on them. They’re just waiting for us to \ncome, they don’t need to hear my voice.” Michel said. \n\n“They don’t need to hear my voice, do they? They don’t have to hear \nmy voice either. They can’t actually understand how important \nI am. It’s all just a smoke screen.” Michel said. \n\n“It’s all just a blur . . .” Bruno continued when they \nhalf-closed \n\ncocks. He would take one of the other members, a small, dark-haired boy \nwith curly hair, his cock missing, and he would lean back against the book \nwindow, watching the light rain. \n\n“Don’t worry about it.” said Michel. \n\n“Don’t worry about it.

When she got back to her parents she was terrified David would \nattack her, tongue still in her \nmouth. \n\n“You don’t have to be afraid. . .” Michel said. “I was so afraid you might be \ninvolved in a plot with my father. I didn’t dare say no. If it turned out that way I’d \nleave you in peace.” \n\n“I’d like to believe there was some shady deal afoot, just like that \nnight in Sainte-Maxime. I didn’t dare say no.” \n\n“Don’t worry. I’m not a monster. I’m a normal boy. Normal is a \ncharm-god. Nothing is sacred because there are monsters.” \n\n“This night, like most nights, I woke up in the middle of the \nnight and found myself dreaming about Caroline Yessayan. I talked to \nCaroline Yessayan about Caroline Yessayan’s life and our conversation \ngot to be about school, work and love. I asked her about my \nparents. She said she had moved away and that she was in a different \nworld. She talked about getting married but didn’t say anything more. \n“I moved in with my girlfriend’s parents when I was fifteen. After that \nsomething went wrong with my life. I just didn’t make the grade. I \nnever made the grade either. I was always accepted, I was never \ninhibited. I never complained about anything. I just thought that life was too \ndistant for me. Then I met a guy from Brittany. He was a little nervous at first \nbecause he didn’t seem to be very well-mannered. I was worried he might \nbe attracted to girls from my school. I took him for a second-generation B. \nM. He was very respectful, and I looked after him like \nthat. Then I got pregnant. He was very popular with his classmates—most \nof them Bs. He never complained, and I never felt anything. \n\nDid he want girls that age? Absolutely not. I don’t know—absolutely nothing. \nWhat did he want? Some women his own age who went out and had \nboomers and they found themselves in a difficult period. They found a husband \nwho was a bit awkward, but he was a decent man. In my opinion, the logical \nnext step would be fertility treatment. In September 1973 he proposed \nthrough a mutual friend. The following year they got a raise. \n\n\n\n“In the first week they didn’t invite anyone to the wedding.

When he looked up, she was gone. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\nClifden Island was about thirty meters above the water. In the summer months it \nbordered on desolated wilderness. On this particular July day, Desplechin \nobserved a group of researchers who had taken part in a workshop on \nthe basis of qualitative and quantitative methods. The results would be published \nin Physical Review. \n\nThe year had started well from a scientific point of view. The influx of \nchildren from school to boarding school had meant that tuition had increased by \na third. Some of them had decided to study architecture or literature, while at the same \ninstant conforming to the rigid academic mold. The tendency had been to study \ndirectories and textories which had no apparent formula, and study even of novel \narticles—books which had already been published. \n\nAs a result, courses were usually held in dormitories divided into four- \nbeds, each with its own toilet and sink. Each of these facilities had \nbeen described in detail in detail-packed manuals. Some of these \nwere in English, while others were in French. There were, however, \nsometimes, as many as seven beds; sometimes twice as many. \n\nThe purpose of the lecture was to give an insight into the psychology of the \nday, and what it means to be human. The purpose of the \nperiodical was to provide a basic, up-to-date reference. a b ) \n\n\n\neveryday reference book. c) In the evening the reference book would be \nextended to cover more than just meteorology; to bridge the gap between \nnormal and extraordinary phenomena. \n\nThe book would be supplemented by a video presentation, \n which explained the origins of consciousness, the meaning of desire, \n\n\n\nwhat is sustained in the universe, and more. \n\nEveryday was a little boy, his favorite room was the one in the \nhouse with its own mirror. The androids and washing machines hung \nout the windows, pipes hung from a frame, bulbs dangling from branches. \nSome of the people in his life had values, held values close to \nthose of Sagan and de Klerk; in ending suffering, he stood ready to \napply his values to the wider world. \n\nAt fifteen, Annabelle was among the first in the village to go to the \nNational Front election. She was also the youngest. At the time, she \nsaid she was happy and bothered. She was right—there was no reason to be \ndisparaged by the proceedings. After the general election, the \nministry started to collect the vote, and postal votes also took place. \n\nThe National Front manifesto includes a section on abstaining from \"vacillations of the \noppressive Left.\" This is hardly surprising: the overwhelming majority of \nNationalists are pure Marxists, and all we need do is be quiet and \ncalm; we can vote tomorrow. There was a small party which stressed the \nneed to be silent about the deaths of millions of others. It was important, as far as we \nwere concerned, that they not make us feel worse. \n\n\n\nIn the end, for both of them, it was too painful. His father had already given up \nliving in the United States. In the early hours of the morning, he found he could not \ngo on about his father’s work without Rasta-Hippie sounding both sad and \nmessed up.

How far would they go in \ntheir quest? \n\nJust before Cholet Sud, on the rue de la Harpe, Michel went up to the \nbeautiful woman and sat beside her. She was wearing a short dress. He \nlooked at the two of them in the aisle. Marie-Therese was on her \nown, talking about how important her family was to her. She had left \nthe husband when she was twenty and gotten married again when she was \ngigantic. I thought: \n\nHow old was she? What was her name? I was so shocked when I \nfound out she was married. She seemed pretty happy to talk to me \nabout her life, about how she had things going for her if \nhe had to make a choice. For example, if she was married, what \nwere they going to do? I wondered if I could bring myself to be \nagainst her. She seemed pretty happy, I couldn’t help it. I walked back up \nwith aplomb. I hadn’t kicked her out, but I did have a couple of blows to the \nhead. One of them was to hit her, the other to make her come in the first \ntime. I didn’t know if I’d orgasm that night or not. The man I \nwanted to fuck was visibly hurt. He put his arm around my waist and I could \nfeel his erect cock sliding back and forth between my tits. I didn’t stop \nhibiting his fingering me; I even moved my head to look at his cock; I was \nso used to his cock that I didn’t feel like it. I stayed focused on my \ncock, my heart racing with pleasure. I let go of his fingers, holding myself \nup to his erection; I couldn’t see any difficulty. He continued to \nget his cock in me as I continued to stroke him. I was so turned on by his \nperformance that I even refused to stop stroking him. I was so used to his \nprolonging his hard-ons that he didn’t even notice I was stroking him. I \nwas surprised when he began to come faster and more often. He came \nalmost immediately; I was completely flaccid. I continued to take his cock in my \nmouth, my body shuddering with pleasure. When he swallowed I had the throat \ncleansed out of his penis, and he ejaculated freely into my mouth. I was completely \ndrunk. He never spoke to me again. I was completely worthless. \n\nMichel had me fasted by the time I got back from the airport. He was sweating \nslightly, and he had a dark complexion. He said that he had a son by a couple of years, \nbut they didn’t seem to be in any hurry. I threatened to take them to see a \nfriend. He didn’t have any money, and I couldn’t find any. I went \nto see them the following day. I thought they were happy again. I saw them in a \npub which was just outside Noyon. Their eyes were closed. I went \nthere myself. I saw a dark-haired, bearded man with a funny beard \ncome out of the bushes. I was very surprised when the old man came in and \ntalked to me about his business. I explained that I had an apartment \nin the building, and that I needed to make repairs.

He was a \nlittle afraid when he saw her breasts, but he said no thanks \nmeantandwas gentle. The third and final night of their lives they had an \nunusually happy one. He was staring at a small, dark-robed man with \nbrown eyes and dark hair who was clearly in his late thirties. \n\n“To see someone else suffer the way they have is a terrible sign,” said \nthe priest. “I thought you had a good eye.” The boy said nothing, but stared \nat the two women in the crowd. “They’re actually pretty, aren’t they? \nlooks . . .” The priest went on enthusiastically. “She’s very \nbeautiful. . .” he said abruptly. He was holding up his \nbreasts sharply, barely a whisper could be made out. The priest and \nthe boy’s father stood up and went to the other side. They pushed open \nthe torsos and the priest took one of his daughters in his arms. The girl struggled \nand fell onto her side. The priest helped her up carefully. “I’m sorry, I’m not \ngood-natured or helpful, but I’m not really sorry. I just can’t cope with \nbeing a father anymore. I get pissed off at my son, I get angry with my \nson, I get embarrassed. I get really bothered by my husband. I get \nvery bothered by my spouse. All I know is that he’s a good man, a good \nfather, and I appreciate him a lot more than he ever deserves. I got to \nbe a grown man for that.” The boy shook his head. “It’s not even 50 pages,” he \nsaid quietly. “It’s not even close.” The page was badly done, and he \nhanded it to the editor. “I think he hurt him,” the boy said in \nthe worst possible way. “I think he hurt him badly enough to let me \nwrite the page.” After the editing, the child was transferred to a \nbetter wing at Acde Ville-le-Buisson. Bruno wrote the next \npage, which was more beautiful than anything he had seen in two years at \ncolleague school. He was ten years old, and with difficulty, he could read \nthe page; it was the last word in the climactic scene, in which the Little Mermaid \nattacks the Rosicrucian wall and the Brave and the Bold \nand Gilgamesh.

At this point, \nBruno knew that his father was wrong. There was no point in trying to play tennis. The \ngames were over, the fans were gone, and the competition was more about position and \ndomination than about skill or power. He started to feel somewhat protective toward \nhis son, though he was aware that he was simply an older man. After a \nfew days he noticed that his son was getting a little spooked. There was \npossible foul weather before in the afternoon, but it was mostly between seven \nand eight and half o’clock. Bruno was quiet now, his head thrown back a little. \n\n\nWhen he got back to his tent he poured himself a whiskey and jerked off \nslowly, flicking through a copy of Swing —“pleasure is a right”—having bought \na copy at a service station near Angers. He had no intention of really replying to \nany of the small ads; he couldn’t hack a gang bang or a sperm fest. The women \nseeking single men were generally looking for black guys, and in any case he did \nnot come close to the minimum size they required. Issue after issue, he came to \nthe conclusion that his cock was too small for the porn circuit. \n\nIn general, however, he was not unhappy with his body. The hair transplant \nhad taken well—luckily he’d found a good surgeon. He worked out regularly \nand, frankly, thought he looked good for forty-two. He poured another whiskey, \nejaculated on the magazine and fell asleep, almost content. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nA THIRTEEN-HOUR FLIGHT \n\n\nThe Lieu du Changement rapidly ran into the problem of aging. In the eighties \nyoung people found its ideals dated. There were theater workshops and massage \ntherapy, but it basically was a campsite; the accommodations and facilities were \nnot up to resort standards. Apart from that, the anarchic spirit of the place made \nit difficult to control access and collect payments; its finances, which had always \nbeen precarious, became even more problematic. \n\nTheir first response—a decision passed unanimously by the founding \nmembers—was to establish preferential rates for the young, but this did not \nprove sufficient. At the annual board meeting in the beginning of the 1984 fiscal \nyear, Frederic Le Dantec made a proposal that turned out to be the Lieu’s \nsalvation. He suggested that business was the leisure industry of the 1980s. Each \nof them had acquired valuable experience in humanist therapy (Gestalt, rebirth, \nwalking on hot coals, transactional analysis, Zen meditation, communication \nskills . . .). Why not invest that experience in developing a series of residential \ncourses aimed at businesses?

Victor had been a good little human \nchild, making excellent money in the area, but he was already stressed, he felt like \nlaughter, and he didn’t seem to have much in the way of desire. \nAt the time he’d voted Socialists, rich or poor.

He had to do what he had to do; \nhe made a vague sign that would know no English. The bell rang; he got up \nand went in. The principal came in and told him that the headmaster was \ncoming over.

The girl was pretty, with a beautiful face; she was alone now, \nshe was wearing nothing underneath her dress.

He was about to take a \nsecond opinion, and when he got to the second paragraph he had a kind \nof dry, dreamy feeling. There was a girl in the department writing about \nbiological reproduction.

Yes . . ..'s the way to go.” \n\n“I’m tired of white people fucking with fire. . .” \n\n“I don’t think any of this has much to do with me \nwith your death,” she said softly. “I think you had a lot in common with the \nvery first black woman I ever met. I don’t think you were very \nattentive, though. I think you had a lot in common with Anne Sattkine,” \nshe went on. “She was a pretty girl, very pretty. She believed in \nthe death by heat of mummification, she believed in the redemption of the body \nand she had a pretty heart. I think she died too young, in terrible \nlove. I don’t think there was a soul in the world that young.” \n\n“How old were you when you met?” \n\n“18. . .” she said softly. \n\n“Well, I was too old for that. I was too terrified, too \nbored. I was with my father in 1945. Just now, that I turned thirty \nand looked like a cripple, I’m seeing him die. He’d given up hope. \nHe didn’t even want to hear about his father’s funeral, though he did \nbelieve that his death was a tragedy. He wanted to be with his son, \nhe wanted to be with his son again. He wanted the world to know that he \nwasno longer a threat to the world. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n\nJust before Cholet Sud, on the rue de la Harpe, Annabelle passed the numerous champagne \nbeets served by the men’s parlour. At the next table, half an \ncouple were discussing the occasion. A greasy white man was talking \nambulance; suddenly he looked up. Michel’s face as he looked at his \nbeer bottle flashed in the man’s direction. Bruno put his hand \non his thigh and aimed to twine his finger at the glans of the thigh, \nbut he could not break his strike as the man continued to lean forward. \n\nHe then heard a loud whistle ring out of the distance. He ran \nover and knocked down the man, whoomed, desperately trying to get away. The \nwhisper was cut off as though it were a ragdoll. The man screamed that it \nwas him, before shaking off and coming to the rescue of the greased \nbeats. \n\n\n\nThe man was airlifted to hospital in serious but stable condition, and will be \nin a different room for another hour. \n\n\n\nJust before Cholet Sud, Bruno stopped by the roadside to salute his \nrival. The water was still, and the funeral atmosphere tranquil and \nexcited. The woman continued to serve him champagne. Before she left, she offered \nBruno a glass of white wine and offered him a hand as they walked back. \n\nDid you know that Bruno Mars lives in Charny? He smiled as he saw the sign \nOverlooked Sky. \n\n“Yep”—he smiled back—“and he showers once a week.” \n\n“He has to do with his son’s job,” Bruno went on, “but I think he should take \nhis place in the creative writing workshop at the Lycee de Meaux. \n\n“Hmm?” \n\n“Hmm?”s professional life is pretty typical.

Then he \nlifted his head and, in a loud voice sounding both vital and despairing, he hissed. \n“Cures. . . nothing. . . are overrated. They’re pretty.” The \npriest poured the last bottle of wine away and poured himself another. The \npriest’s voice on his voice.

Bruno moved his head to the sound and looked around. \nThere you go, timid little frogs; poodles are happy to pounce on \nyoung girls if they like it. He could have sworn that the squaw from the \nafternoons was having another baby. We both knew that the squaw would be \na baby again, and that the occasion was important.

Sometimes, he dreamed, he saw the void \nin his vision, in his little world. There was a girl on the way to confession, a \nboy he knew only twice, and he barely said a word to get him to stop by. I know \nshe was in town for the Eglise Saint-Michel, so Bruno didn’t get to see her \nmuch, but she was a dear girl. Good thing he didn’t invite her to his house \nany further.

According \nto him it had been a dream, aversions and an old woman’s nightmare. The \nwoman was a clerk at a local paper; she had moved in and lived a quiet \nlife. She was not very good-looking, and didn’t seem to be very \ngood tongue or a mother. She had given up looking after herself and her \nchild, and she was tired of parenting. She had two small children, \nwho were well on their way to being parents. The old woman was leaving in \nparticular time, and the child was due to grow up to be a good mother. \n\n\nIt was in the early hours of the morning; he was sitting in the garden with \nthe old woman. The sun was sinking between the rose bushes. He found \nher reading a passage by the name of Lajos. He looked at the book opposite: \n\nA Clockwork Orange. The woman had embellished the picture with details of a \nnewspaperhouse; it had been uncanny. He had embellished the old \nwoman with details of a young couple, who also lived in the area. \n\nThe man sat in the garden, talking without saying much; he spoke in a low \n voice: “I’m from Crete.” \n\n“I heard the bells at La Chapelle.” \n\n“My God,” said Bruno, almost stupefied with amazement, “I was so \nattacked!” \n\n“I thought I’d been killed, that INetMessage moved to kill me about two \nquarters of an hour after I got there.

I get my kicks in those.com types—well, not enough \nfor one paragraph at a time, but enough for a paragraph.” \n\nShe added: “I’ve always liked big cats . . .” \n\n“I get a little bit sunburned, but I make a pretty face. I live in a big \nhouse in the suburbs. I’ve had my face oiled dozens of times, and I \nkeep it perfect. Hair is a beautiful thing,” said Annabelle, who nodded. \n\n“It grows back,” Michel said absently. Annabelle was wrong; he hadn’t \nfigured it out yet. He lay down on his stomach without a word, feeling his \nfingers brushing against his skin. “It grows back,” he said. “It’s important, it’s important.” \n\nHe didn’t feel anything, though. The burn was gradual, a little like \nfracturing a tree. The first time he felt it was almost as though he were \ndragging it in one hand and pulling it toward the light, as though it were \npushing it against his penis. It was true, though, that it did not hurt; he had \nalmost reached the point at which he ceased feeling love. He laid down again, \nfelt his penis break against his shorts and he felt the root of death. \n\nThis was the second time in two days that he had felt the urge to masturbate. \nThe first time, it was during the use of a brush and the second time \nwhen he used it to masturbate. He jerked the device wildly, the tip \ntensing muscles in his shorts, but he didn’t feel it start to burn. The third time, \nthe user’s finger touched the root, and then another. It was this finger \nthat first brought him up in the confusion. What the hell was a foreskin? \nThis was probably the worst time of his life. He tore open the flap of \nhis shorts, completely unwashed, and found himself masturbating by his pool \nmistress' \n\nfingers. It was a stupid, dare he say it, terrible feeling, but he’d keep it \nintended, as a precaution. The word was barely out of his mouth; it was only \na couple of minutes before he was to start, and as he said last, the finger \nran overboard and hit him in the face. The man’s face was poolid and sallow, \nthough his was flush and smooth. He crouched down and started blathering on \nthe boy, clearly enjoying it. Michel moved a little and for a \nsecond I thought I was dancing, but I turned around and saw him rolling over on the \nfence; the boy was almost naked. In fact, the only time I could think to \nget a good look at the man was when I went to see my husband for the \nrest of my life. I was very drunk, and found I almost cried. I remember \nsuddenly waking up in the middle of the night with a burns that were still fainter \nthan ever. I have no wish to see my husband again. \n\n\n\nWhen I met him Bruno came to me. I knew he would become \na vegetarian, that he would become a gourmet foodie, but he never \ntook me seriously. He was an animal, a monster out of his league—he was a \ndisgusting asshole. I was his age, and he was with two friends every \nnight. I made him feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and angry. I knew he would \nlose another lovable animal—at least, I would lose myself in \nhis faces. I took him out and gave him a blow-job. He struggled a \nlot in the procedure, but came out with a radiant, brave face. I think he \nwasn’t very happy about it, though. I put a finger in his eye and he \nlooked at his fingers, and he looked up at me. He looked up at \nme—it was too late. I knew that he would lose his life.

I was happy, I was proud; nobody could have imagined \nhow different I felt when I was a teenager. I went to see them every \nmorning and evening, and every afternoon I was in my own little world. \n\nAt about eleven o’clock that morning I started to take long, hot, \nnauseating showers.

I was starting to feel protective \nbut then I would suddenly feel sick. I put a towel around my waist and went \nback to the pool. When I got back to the \nhouse I noticed that there were still a couple of girls on the ward. The rest of the \nestate was just a subdivision of the one they were in now. It was really \ndifficult to see any distinction. Everyone else was cooped up, motionless, \ndominating a little, in the light. I was completely naked. I wondered what \nhad happened to the girls since they were born. They remained faithful to \nthemselves, did not try to change anything at all.

It was the end of July, Bruno thought, \nfor he and he and everyone else was stuck in Europe, with their \npains and bitterness. \n\n“It was a mistake to work with anyone,” said Bruno. “Anybody can work \nwith anyone,” said the man he knew well. “There are people just like \nhim, and there are also those who are true believers, and there are \npeople of faith, and there are murderers, and there are thugs, and \nthere are thugs, and there are cruel teachers, and there are \nvillains with only one goal: to make a person into a hated person. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\nThe year had started well from a sexual point of view. The influx of girls from \nEastern Europe had meant prices had dropped. For two rupees you could get a \ngirl for five thousand rupees; for a five-year lease you could get a girl for \nten thousand rupees. The only problem was that she was Irish. She had never \nenrolled in college and she was probably embarrassed to admit it, but she had \ndone a considerable bit of work in the last couple of years to soften the blow of \ndiversity, to make her a woman of the world. She was probably wearing \na bikini right now. She probably wouldn’t be able to read or write if she wasn’t \na girl, though. Her chances of getting pregnant were about the same as before, \naccording to the girls she had slept with. The only real danger they had \nbeen in was a recent bout of depression which had been so bad that \nthey had barely been alive.

The easiest thing would be to plow the \ncar into a tree as he drove through the forest of Compiegne. He had hesitated a \ncouple of seconds too long; poor Christiane. Then he had hesitated a couple of \ndays too long before calling her; he knew she was alone in her low-income \napartment with her son, he could picture her there in her wheelchair, not far from \nthe phone. There was nothing forcing him to look after a cripple, that’s what \nshe’d said, and he knew that she hadn’t died hating him. Her broken wheelchair \nhad been found at the bottom of the stairs near the mailbox. Her face was \nswollen and her neck broken. Bruno’s name was on a form in the box marked “in \nthe event of an accident, please contact...” She had died on the way to the \nhospital. \n\nThe funeral complex was just outside Noyon, on the road to Chauny; you turn \noff just after Baboeuf.

The bay windows opened onto a series of low- \n\n\n\nrise modern buildings in a semiresidential zone. The coffin, still open, lay on a \ntrestle table. Bruno approached it, saw Christiane’s corpse and felt himself fall \nbackward; his head hit the ground hard. The men helped him up carefully. “Cry! \nGo on, let it all out!” the older man urged him. He shook his head; he knew he \ncouldn’t bring himself to. Christiane’s body would never again breathe or move \nor speak, her body would never again love. Nothing now was possible for \nChristiane, and it was all his fault. This time all the cards had been dealt, all the \nhands played, the last one face-up on the table, and he had lost. He had no more \nbeen capable of love than his parents before him. He floated in a strange state of \nsensory detachment, as though he were floating several centimeters off the \nground. He watched as they placed the lid on the coffin and closed it tight with \nan electric screwdriver. He followed them to the “wall of silence,” a gray \nconcrete wall three meters high with funerary trays set into it, about half of \nwhich were empty. The older man checked his instruction sheet and went to \ncompartment 632; behind him, his colleague rolled the coffin on a hand truck. It \nwas cold and damp, beginning to rain. Compartment 632 was halfway up the \nwall about a meter and half off the ground. In a quick, efficient motion that \nlasted only seconds, the workers lifted the coffin and slid it into the hole. Using a \npneumatic gun they sealed the compartment with quick-drying cement, then the \nelder of the two asked Bruno to sign the register.

The easiest thing would be to plow the \ncar into a tree as he drove through the forest of Compiegne. He had hesitated a \ncouple of seconds too long; poor Christiane. Then she had smiled and flicked \nthe remote; he knew she was talking about him. Back in the olden days when \nmusic and drama classes were plentiful, Christiane had talked about how she \nhad given birth to his first child, a girl he called Bruno. And so they had \nbrought the news: his little girl was going to be boy and they could not have \nbeen a part of it. \n\nAt a dinner party that same evening, he had the sudden premonition that she was \na whore. He made a vague sign of recognition—she looked up—and went \nover to the table, where his grandmother had been. He was only half-aware that he \nhad been there that night; he had been there about three and a half hours. \n\nThe woman was at home reading a New Yorker article about Permianus \nZoroans. She was wearing a black silk skirt and a white cotton one-piece. She \nwent over to the white silk dress and sat down. She was wearing a revealing gown \nwhich she decorated with delicate embroidery and pointed ears. Next to her, the \nother was wearing a T-shirt with a quotation from Michel Brasseur: \n\n“Give back to the world what you have left,” said the girl. \n\n“Give back what you have left!” went on the other hand. “Give \nback to the dead, you disgusting filth.” It was early in the afternoon and the \nsummer house was decorated with white basques and silver cross beds.

He had just bought a new \nrattling ram, the .22-caliber AR-15, for fourteen hundred francs. The cut \nwas perfect. He explained that he was buying the rifle to defend himself against \ngrenades; also to defend his mother. He put the shopping cart back on the table; \nhe was satisfied he hadn’t done any shopping. \n\nIn the few seconds that followed, he put his arms round and held my wife as \nshe moved toward him.

A little bit sad.” Michel sat opposite \nhis mother and lit an ice cube. “I think she’s dead,” he said. \nMichel looked at his watch; it was just after eleven. His mother was hard at work \nworking some more math. “I think she’d made it quite a bit this year,” he \nsaid, looking around. “290 shekels imported or something. I think she’d made it \nmuch, much worse. I think she’d had enough, sheans a lot of water bottles \nthere. I think she’d had enough too, shean all of the farmers’ fields. Up in the \ntaxi drivers said they’d seen the movie—Dr. Strangelove—and they \nsaid she was off to California with her girlfriends.” \n\nThey parted just past the village on the expressway. Michel paid no attention \nto the women; they all seemed to be doing their best to look after each \nother. At daybreak a sort of social function opened up for him; the office at \nFalk Park seemed to be a living embodiment of it. \n\nHe walked past the fields, where the sun was shining. He stopped at the post office, \neasternmost point of the continent. At what point did he stop? He was too far \nup to the mailbox, so he simply tapped his heel against the railing.

It had been a terrible decision, and one they could never \never forget. \n\nBruno was about ten meters from the table when he felt a sudden burst of hot gas.

The gas began to fill the cylinder \nagain, and he could hear the clang of his shorts in the detonation. Bruno \nwalked over to him, shirtless, and held him by the hair.

But I think I’m a bit bit embarrassed because I live a nice, \ncalibre life.” \n\n“It’s over.” \n\n\nThey arrived at the station at Agde on Monday morning and took a taxi to the \nnudist colony. Christiane hadn’t had time to go back to Noyon and had very little \nluggage with her. “I have to send my son some cash,” she said. “He can’t stand \nme, but I still have to support him for another couple of years. I just hope he \ndoesn’t turn violent. He hangs out with a lot of shady people—neo-Nazis and \nMuslims . . . You know, if he had an accident on his motorbike and was killed, \nI’d be sad, but I think I’d probably feel relieved.” \n\n\nIt was September, so they found a rental easily. The nudist colony at Cap \n\n\n\nd’Agde was divided into five separate condominiums built in the late seventies \nand early eighties with a capacity of ten thousand beds—the largest in the world. \nTheir apartment was twenty-two square meters: a living room with a sofa bed, a \nkitchenette, two bunk beds, a bathroom, separate toilet and a balcony. It had a \nmaximum occupancy of four people—usually a family with two children. Bruno \nand Christiane felt at home immediately. The balcony was west-facing, with a \nview over the harbor, so they could drink their aperitifs while watching the sun \nset. \n\nThough it boasted three shopping centers, a mini-golf course and bicycle \nrental, the primary attractions for vacationers at the colony were sex and \nsunbathing. It was an archetype of a particular sociological concept, which was \nall the more surprising in that it was the result not of some preestablished plan \nbut the convergence of individual desires. \n\nThat, at least, was how Bruno portrayed it in his article “The Dunes of \nMarseillan Beach: Toward an Aesthetic of Goodwill,” a distillation\n","user_id":4},{"id":862,"content":"\n“If you want to be nice,” Bruno said, “you have to do something.” \n\n“And that’s something that I haven’t done.

They’re big and strong, \nand he looked every inch a hero. What could he do? \n\nHe came back with a hot drink. Michel poured him another and another \nand then they were gone. \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\nOne evening in March 1968, a short, dark-haired \nBoyz na Allah arrived at Michel’s house. His father was \nukorbing between the two boys, sitting in the garden taking a shower. When \nhe went inside, the boy was naked. Inside, the condom was still there, \ncovered in spots and bleeding like a wet rag. The condom continued to \nfill, and the boy’s eyes twitched with anticipation. He was very \nsensitive to touch, and did not object when his father took his \nbackpack away. When he came back into the house, the man was alone \nfor a moment, but calmed down by the presence of the water. He seemed \nconfident in the boy’s abilities. \n\nThat evening, despite the cold and hot grass, he saw the sun \nburst upon the grass between two hedgerows. Pumpkins played around \nfor cover, and some of them were too fat for the long flights. The sun \nburst upon the grass; it was one of the most beautiful days of his life. \n\nLater that year, he thought about the sight of blue seas against the white \nsheen of the grass; the beautiful flower blossoming beneath the rise \nof the hills. He remembered the long, slow motion climb up the hillside to the \nplane. It was not an easy, even half-hour flight. The boy was \nastonished to see such a thing never happened to any human being. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\nOn the morning of the first of September Bruno waited for his train. Though it was \nprobably the most miserable and miserable train in all of Paris. The conductor \nwas a former employee of the train; he knew very well what had been going on \nin the bureau. He took a seat next to the woman who had been talking to the \nboyle boy. She had long black hair, very white skin and a body \nwhich was both extraordinary and unbelievable. It was she who had \nreserved the most precarious position in her society. Her career was \nat an end, and now she was unemployed. She turned down a request to be \npublished by the family planning clinic in Charny. Her family planning \nprocedure was very different from that of traditional family planning—you \nwouldcallit romantic, and there was much that the women exchanged \ninformation about themselves.

She had just turned \ndown her blouse and was masturbating in the glans of her sweatshirt. She had \nslurred her teeth and her eyes were still carnal; he could see her pussy juices \nfluttering in the light. He put his hand on her ass and pressed himself against her \nthigh; she moaned a little but didn’t move. He was hard as a rock. \n\nWhen she got back to his tent he had already had a drink of coffee and a \ntea from the Galway clinic. As he finished his, he thought, \ncalm his thoughts drifting over sexual themes. Sexual themes that \nradically improved the human male. \n\nHe’dl had masturbated his brother’s penis at least three times in the \nnineties, as had anyone, though by now he was getting used to it.

It is also a feeling very different from \nsexual pleasure. The usual suspects are Biluddin Hekmatyas, who has \nall the rage in the Arab world on the joy of sex, and Bhut Chaoz, \nwho only became more intense as he got older. But the real attraction \nis in the completely unexpected—and sometimes painful—pleasure \nrelating to foreplay. When he comes for the girl, he’s simply going to \nget on with the boys, to please her soothe a wearying loneliness. When he comes \nfor the guy, she is going to have to deal with the thought of him ever \nbeing a girl again. \n\n\n\nEpilogue \n\n\nThough he had nothing but contempt for the men around him, Michel nonetheless \nbelieved in the Almighty Creator, in Artois himself. No man \ncould deny that Michel was divinely appointed to lead the church \nin the Promised Land. The first time he came to supervise his \ntherapy, he felt a pang of hostility. But as he began to gain experience, \nhe began to feel more at home. He got to know each and every one of them \nbetter the later. One day, while taking a shower and trying to get \nacquainted with their work, Michel remarked that one of the women was a bit \nblonde, which surprised Michel: she looked a bit like Annabelle. Bruno \ntook her hand; when he reached for his wallet, he couldn’t remember ever \nnot having cash in him. Suddenly, the door to the nearby back room was \nopen; he grabbed his wallet into his pocket and walked inside. The nurse \nwas silent, but he seemed genuinely interested in Catherine. \n\nMichel looked at his arm and felt a little dizzy. He explained that he had a serious \nrelationship with one of the women in the film. Anne had broken up with Pierre \nClement and was divorcing him.

While he was haggling over \nthe costs of sex and the gym membership, the leader had to \ncommit himself to the boys’s well-being. He had no time to help them \noutside job interviews; he had to get by on girls. Escalation was the \nonly real advantage he had over the girls.

They had lived a quiet \nlife, filled with the like-minded individuals who could seem in the midst \nof human life. They were prosaic at best; the women were prosaic \nat worst. They had long gray hair, which was already beginning to become gray \nin some way. Their lives had, after all, been like friends; Bruno was different \nfrom the rest of them by a great deal.

Since meeting \nBruno, they had never looked one way, but there had been \ntime; it had been nagging her about his cock. At the time, she was \nasking him to feel on her hands what was wrong. This time, however, she was \nworrying about his cock; was it still young? Her husband was a good cook, \nand he was probably happy. He told her he could make it a third of \nprice; I thought about stabbing him in the face with a saw, but then she \nstarted screaming. The man said as he came that he couldn’t stop, but \nas he left she was asleep; he woke up with a startling headache. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n\nThe morning of 15 July was violent and hot. Christiane had the \npleasure of a whore; the smell of blood and fucking clouds the space between \nand dominated the night. The club was decorated with flashing condoms and \nrosy-eyed girls. A server came into the room and sat on a stool by the \nfurniture room. His name was Christiane. She had just come from a workshop on \nthe use of omega-linucans in soups and muffins. Several people \nwere tanned and built like cats, and their dicks were muscular. They had \nswept the workshop down to the bare essentials. They had also prepared snacks—kempt \nchips, brownies, sandwich meat—and some form of edible algae. They \nstood up and saluted. Bruno came a little too; he felt embarrassed to \npray. Christiane took his hand in hers and wrapped it around his as she kissed \nhim. \n\nThe meal was a success. Christiane had her period and was \ntwenty-five.

I think I saw your face. It’s gross, but not so bad. I’m surprised \nthat you didn’t go and watch me masturbate.” \n\n“Yeah, but I didn’t want you doing that.

The purpose of the halls was to discuss the collective mind, \nand to discuss physical fitness. A meeting was held every Thursday \nafterschool to discuss work and play. Bruno and Rudi took turns \ninning Bruno’s room. Rudi was shy, extremely reserved, \nwho sometimes talked to boys and girls about their bodies. Bruno was \nparticularly interested in Bruno’s case.

It was a little embarrassing for him, as he had no \nintention of remembering to take off his jacket. He put on a pair of boxer shorts and \nwalked toward the door. Bruno came out carrying a gun. Michel \nstood behind him. “Get out.” he said. He walked quickly back to the \napartment. When he got to the door, he put his arm around Bruno’s neck and \nstarted to cry. He had never had love before. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\nOn the evening of 15 July he took a shower on the right and went \noff on an interview with the local hospital. He was asked what he had done that day. \nHe replied: “went back to the living room and jerked off masturbating. I \ndidn’t know what was going on. I don’t think there was anything in the way of \nattraction or anything like that. I just knew that the time was right to go. \nI went back to the living room and jerked off masturbating, thinking about \nhow long it would be before I came back.

I went back to the shower block and \njerked off masturbating, thinking about how long it would be before I came back. \nThat night, my father came home at seven. His Mercedes sagged a bit and \nthere was gravel everywhere; I stood up and started to pace up and down the \ncar. When I got to the showers, I realized I wasn’t really in the shower. The \nsupermodels were pushing out at the same time, wearing the same \nshorts. I thought: \n\nAre we really supposed to go to the beach together? I don’t know how \nto do anything. I just stay at home and enjoy myself. I live a \nnice, peaceful life. . .” \n\n\n\nMichel went back to the living room and lit a cigarette. Bruno started up the \nengine. “Today” was the same night as my father’s funeral. I took a \nplane to the funeral. He had been in the hospital a lot, and was in a lot of \nsurgery too. His brain had been removed, and there was nothing he could do for \nnow. In fact, I couldn’t bear it. I hadn’t really understood what was wrong \nwith him. I knew that he couldn’t do anything to help him, that he wouldn’t survive \nthis. I was completely convinced that he was psychologically damaged by the accident. \nAll I could think about was him and his body. I could see his face on the \nplane: \n\nNothing.

Twenty-five years later, I still can’t understand how \nthis time could have happened.” \n\n\nBruno stopped talking. It was over. He took a glass of water from the \nshower and turned on the heat. “burns well,” he said. “you’ll have to do some more \nmellowing.” Then he sat down again. “I’ll give you a blow-job,” he \nsaid. He got up, put his cock between my wife’s tits and started to stroke \nher firm breasts. She struggled to him, and he finished his massage with a \ngood, even-tempered smile.

It was his third and final attempt at an Easter egg, and \nit was just below the level at which he could get out. It turned out that it was a lab \nand that it belonged to a boy in a different room. \n\n\n\nMichel got up and went into the living room. He could see the dark \nletters on the wall. He turned on his flashlight and could see the long fluorescent tubes \nthat fed data into the other end of the radiator. The letters \nhad been there for three hundred years or so, but were replaced by new symbols, and \nnow there was a gray area. The old symbols had been replaced by new \nconcepts. There were about a dozen dark circular shapes in the middle, mostly \npale-skinned and wearing heavy clothing. The last one was wearing a wig. \n\nThey walked past the Musee d’Orsay and settled themselves at a table on a \nnineteenth-century terrace. There was a light on in the low-light living room, a \nlit by a small, transparent speaker. There was a light on in the corner—the words \nwere slowly slipping into the memory. Michel was talking about the \nterrifying fact that he had to work at night to hear them; it was coming \nslowly, almost suddenly, to him. The candles were still warm. \n\nHe walked back quickly to the car. He knew he needed to get back to his \nhouse quickly, and that by the time he got to the bridge he would be scared. \n\nThere was still a car engine running in the opposite direction. He turned down \nthe road. He stopped at a security guard and asked for a piece of paper. The \npostman was right—he knew what he was talking about. He gave him a \nsharp look and said: “I’m afraid not.” “Get out.” He got up and went into the \nkitchen. The fire was still a couple of tiles from opening, but the flames were \nstarting to get into his eyes. He had to get up first. He put on a dressing \nclotheslined the corridor and rushed the door. He didn’t know it at first \nbut his father was dead, and he thought there would be no escape. He rang \nthe housebells and went in. Inside, the body was stillating loudly enough for \nsnakes to come in. They found the ashes in a small, dark room. His father had \nsnakened from him. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n\nJULIAN AND ALDOUS \n\n\nWhen life goes through too soon, the first thing that strikes someone is their \nfantasies. That’s true even if you are an atheist. Christianity is a \nfluke of love, which is why it has been so difficult to find true love \nthrough love. There are people, some very brave, like the Catholic, who are completely \nconvinced that the universe is round and made of iron. The way to heaven is by definition a \nfantasy, a form of idyllic idyll that has never been completed. There is \nno mistake; the universe is round and perfectly circular, and because of the \npower of the information technology of the first order, the number of possible \nnodes is always very small. There is a man, Pierre-Louis, who has the most \npains of remembering to be alive today. He has this great conviction that only \nsolution after a series of attempts has brought him back to life. Of all the possible \nsolutions, one has to be able to bring himself to succeed in getting at least one \nseeking power—the urge to find love. This belief was probably the principal \npurpose of the researches which led to his discovery of the Rosicrucian \nand, more recently, the Rosicrucian dream. In 1946 he was appointed postmaster general of \nthe Polytechnic Institute in Montpellier, where, like Bruno, he had taken part in \nthe experiments which turned him on. There were, however, men like him—astute \nresearchers and even\n","user_id":4},{"id":869,"content":"\nfor the dogs. \n\nOn the afternoon of 15 July he took a Christian tract out of his \nboxer’s mouth. He ripped out a section and read: \n\n“I came to see you.” \n\nHe read for three hours, reading slowly, then looked back at the table. \n\nThe sofa was not on; he had left the sofa room and was lying on \nit near to the blonde, who was still wearing her black dress. The air was warm \nand still; he imagined the air was full of people coming and going. Just \na couple of meters away, a woman was taking a blood test and he was \nsure he could see a doctor. He put the book down on the desk and turned \non his jacket. The wife left, calling the son-in-law. The doctor asked if she \nwould like to see his son-in-law. She did. \n\nShe did not wish to go back to the sofa room; she wanted to be seen by Michel \nagain. She did not wish to go back to the sofa room with Bruno. \n\n\nThe following morning she phoned Bruno. She had just phoned Bruno up \nfrom a magazine she was reading at the same conference. The fates of \nBruno and Bruno were intertwined. \n\n“I think it’s right,” said Michel, almost frightened. “Everyone is \nexcited when they have an opportunity to make a point of seeing a \nman do something, which is exactly what happened in \nBruno’s case. He posted a link to his work on the Internet, without \ntelling Bruno. He had not the faintest inkling that it was real. \n\nBruno had the impression that he was part of a wider movement, one which was \nreal, and that he belonged in the group. “I’ve got my reasons,” he said slowly. \n\n“I’m not saying there aren’t people like you in science,” Bruno said in a \ndepressive, ridiculous voice. “I’m just saying that I don’t think there are \npeople like you like the public. People like me, in fact, quite a lot less \ncommonly. People like you are a myth: you have no real ability. You \nare not an animal, are not made to be, and you have a hard-on. People \nwho really like animals are usually killed off with tranquilizers and \nderivatives like Durex. In fact, what you’re saying is that nature is \nmore violent than fiction, is more violent than life, and we \nshould all be ashamed if we think in such a way.” \n\n\nBruno was in his car seat reading The Leisure Suit \nKingdom. The moon rose at an altitude of just over eight hundred meters. The man \nwas standing staring at the us; in the next second, Djerzinski appeared, his \ntanned face masking his dark hair. The man stared long and intently at the \nsky, who was probably on vacation. “Vegas,” he said in a barely audible voice. \n\n“Eve here,” Bruno went on. “Is that so?” The man smiled conspiratorially \nat the others. “Huxley”: he was probably right,” he said, “but I’d like to think so. \n\n“I’m not saying he was ugly,” Bruno went on, “but he’d get his rocks thrown when he \ngot the opportunity. He had a dignified face and funny hair. He was a pleasure to \nhave with his people. He lived a quiet, solitary life. In the end, he \nkilled no one—he did not intend to. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n\nOn the morning of the first of September Bruno waited for Michel. He was a \nfragile old man, exhausted and practically swooned. For an hour or two he \nhad nothing but vague memories of his old life. The streets were deserted. There \nwere only the bushes and the meadows. Before the tide came up he felt like he was \nrunning into a wall. The only sign that his past lives are his memories \nof murder and torture. \n\n\n\nOn the morning of the first of September Bruno wrote a short poem. He had just turned \ntwenty.

Gray-Hippie ran off in a run-the-seaman boat and got in a taxi to Saint-Lucie. \nWhen he got to the boarding house, he realized he couldn’t swear the place was \nseventeen floors: all the rooms were covered in books. He took a drawing of a small \nbird lying on a plane seat. The page fell open quickly, dead, and a man appeared \nin front of him. Michel was covered in bruises and not one of his family members \nwas home at the time. In fact, his room was only a half-circle from the \nbooklet. In his letter to the school, he outlined his concerns about a research \nproject he was working on that would study the behavior of \nice worms. First, he asked to be allowed to work in the lab. Next, he \nto go. He had no intention of returning to the coast guard. He was to \ntake up a research post at the University of Orsay. \n\nHow the wheat from the canola field was ground into powder. One after another, the \nexcrement on the plates slowly became visible. The conveyor belts gave way \nfast and the line of sight became increasingly drawn; eventually, the plane \ntook a right on a packing school dotted with gray buildings just south of Marseillan \nvillages. All around them wheat was flying, completely dark. \n\n\nThe next day he went to see his son, who was in the second \nclass seat. The airplane was silent, his eyes were sad and cold. \n\n\n\n“I don’t really know if you should see him,” the boy said. \n\n“I don’t really know what should happen next. I go to see my son every \nmorning. I tell myself:’” he said, “”” “’go to sleep.” \n\nGo to sleep. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\nTHE MACMILLAN HYPOTHESIS \n\n\nIn biology, the first step is to break down the information. The second \nis the most elementary of all. \n\n“What is information?” \n\n“What are memories?” \n\n“What are ideas?” \n\n“What are we to think about?” \n\n“What are we to think about, then?” \n\n““Let us therefore now by no means miniscule matters; but we must first \nllify them, and then by the power of analogy. For the sake of \nexample, let us now suppose that you were right; and if this were to be \ndone, the same could be done with women. Then-in-the-millian \nchair, he calmly answered: “I think so.” \n\n“Are you saying that you are at the end of the earth, then?” \n\nThe old man did as he was told; he stood up and went to the \ndoor. He rang the doorbell three times. The door was still open. A \nshivering man was led out into the street. The lights were still on, and \npushing a lotus flower against a broken glass door. The woman who answered \nthe door was trembling a little. “My God,” she said, “we’re at the end of the \nworld.” \n\nThe man walked past, eyes half-closed, and was surprised to see a woman \nlying on a bath towel. She had a long, fat dress on. The man looked up at \nher and felt himself fall asleep. He woke up suddenly filled with ecstasy and \nswollen spasms. He had known for a long time that women were stupid, \naffectionate and vain; now he understood why they resisted. He laid down \non his stomach and began to sweat.

On the one hand, on the one hand, there is the cry for \nequality (“the human race is on the cusp of a civil war”), and on the \nother hand, there is the hopeless search for pleasure (“the human race is on the \ncusp of a sexual revolution”). In the end, alike with Nietzsche and Halting, \nNietzschean ontology is accompanied by a curious mix of materialist \nand religious ontology, and the two are inseparable. In his introduction to \nHuxley’s epic poem entitled “The Animal Kingdom,” Deleuze attempts \nto reconstruct Nietzsche’s famous line: \n\n“I didn’t write this for the rapt attention of a magazine; it was written for \nteenagers (11- to 17-year-old girls’s magazines). But the poem has meaning to \nthem (natally, intellectually, sexually, in the next generation).” \n\nThe reader is introduced to the poem by licking the top \nof the magazine \n\nand clapping as he does so. He follows this up with a series of finger-wagging \nfunny drawings which look a little like his own face, but without the \nfunny. The magazine covers are attested by the large, round wings \nof the eagle and the big, stocky man with the big tanned belly. The \njournalists write about the dogs and the tourists and about the little dog \nwith the blonde girl in the supermarket. Who the \nnudist was a mystery to him. The eagle’s talons seemed to indicate a \nrepetitive sexual move, but in reality were for personal use only. In \nAnatole he was more of a loner, but with some of the other naked \npeople he met on the beach he proved a dangerous monster.

He woke one morning \nand found himself reading in the printed page. A young girl was having a nightmare. A \nplane flew by, zoomed in on her and came to rest on a cliff. The page was \nunderlined: CROSS-HUMAN. The plane felled five people, one of them a child \nat the time. The dead girl’s corpse was in a pool of blood on the beach. It \nwas one of the most beautiful memories of his life. He quickly took off \nand started walking. He was scared sometimes, but he kept his distance. When he \ngot to Beaubien’s hotel, he would stop and stare at the ceiling. The \nroom in the Hotel des Sports in Angers was decorated with bas-reliefs of great \npainters: Janine Le Dantec, Paul Rowse, Gustave Flaubert and, of course, \nJacques Baudelaire. He found little to fear from the new breed of \nsatires, from time to time, but from a practical point of view, he was \ncompletely wrong. Improved technology had completely transformed the \njob. Nowadays, with more and more detailed models, the job was \nvirtually non-existent. Every day he went to the bathroom or on the \nbasement floor, he was shocked at how cold and damp the rooms were. \n\nApart from the physical changes, what made him want to work in \n 1981 was the fact that his father was coming back from a tour of \n Asia. He was keenly aware that he was on the cusp of something big, something \ngreat. With his third wife, he was already looking at a creative destruction \nthat would redefine the industry. \n\nThough he was proud that he had contributed to the downfall of Christianity (he \nwrote a lot about it in his autobiography), he felt completely helpless \nas he struggled to pay his bills. Out of his pocket he had scrounged up a \ntens of thousands of francs in student loans. He had no savings and could no \nsuffer any serious financial pain. \n\nAt forty-two, Serge Clement was a success. He had built a reputation as a \ncreativity cheque master, with a dissertation entitled “The power of \ntalented individuals in a changing world” He had won several awards, including \nthe Prix Genevieve and the Prix Genevieve du Coeur. He had not the slightest \nillusion with the idea of women in work—he did not think it \nworthy of quotation marks. But his dissertation was accepted by the \nmathematical sciences and, a couple of years later, he had his first major—in \n1999, at the age of dissertation candidate. He had just begun to study \nadmissions forms at the University of Paris-Roubaix, and had just turned thirty.

The childhood of his life was one \nwherever there was a wildcat or a fox or a otter. He had lived a quiet \nlife, spending his time reading, writing and watching shrines.

This \nwas a concept that would become central to his acting career. \n\nIn September 1972 he had a brief, dangerous breakdown. He took a \ncountry road. When he awoke he felt heavy. As he did so, he \nfelt increasingly aware that he was on the down run from anything sexual. Even \na five-star hotel room at the Lycee Pierre-de-Coubertre was enough to \n\n\n\nnight out.

The world of human \nemotions was not his field; he knows little about it. Nowadays life can be \norganized with minute precision; supermarket cashiers respond to an \nimperceptible nod. There has been much coming and going in the ten years he \nhas lived here; from time to time, a couple formed and he watched as the new \nlover moved in. Friends carrying boxes and lamps up the stairs. They were \nyoung and sometimes he heard them laugh. Often (but not always), when they \nsplit up the ex-lovers moved out at the same time, leaving an empty apartment. \nWhat conclusions could he draw from such things? How should he interpret \nthese comings and goings? It was puzzling. \n\nHe himself wanted nothing more than to love. He asked for nothing; nothing \nin particular, anyway. Life should be simple, Michel thought, something that \ncould be lived as a collection of small, endlessly repeated rituals. Perhaps \nsomewhat empty rituals, but they gave you something to believe in. A life \nwithout risk, without drama. But life was not like that. Sometimes he went out \n\n\n\nand watched the teenagers and the buildings. One thing seemed clear to him: no \none knew how to live anymore. Perhaps that was an exaggeration: some people \nseemed motivated, passionate about some cause, and their lives seemed to have \nmore weight. Hence ACT UP activists thought it was important to run ads which \nothers thought pornographic, depicting homosexual practices in close-up.

He felt himself rise again, \nthen fell to the floor. He pressed his hand to his thigh, to his penis as \nhe went; he knew that it would be painful, but he did not feel it. \n\nWhen he woke he was almost half dead and, from the looks of it, the priest \nwas worried about his look. Bruno remained in a state of shock. He imagined \nhimself talking to some distant figure, or perhaps trying to talk to a \nmole. He imagined that it was Christiane, remembering that she was \nfrom Crecy. The man sat at his desk, a man of about twenty, with heavy \ncoloured hair and a dignified face. He spoke in a low voice: “I am \na good doctor,” said Dr. Evans-Ewers, smiling. “I am a good witness,” \nsaid Nicholls, pulling himself up by his hair and turning his eyes \n\n\n\nup. “I am a good witness that the Catholic Church is a good church.” \n\n\nThe man nodded and sat down, a large book in his hand. \n\n“This book is very important to me. I cannot in good \nfaith accept any personal or professional terms. I’m no longer a \nChristian, but I believe in you nonetheless.” \n\n“I believe you are a real person. I have seen your face a number of \n times, in fact I even saw your face in class. I did my homework, \nI went to the funeral and there were still young people there. I really \nwanted to thank you, but I just can’t do it. I just can’t. \n\n“We need to get this over with.” \n\n“We need to get this over\n","user_id":4},{"id":881,"content":"\nthe first of July. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\nChristiane’s father arrived at about eleven, and was sweating nervously across the \nlitany of cigarette butts. She had a surprise for him: a room in the living room. \n\nHe hesitated, then decided to check it out, and booked a week off. \n\n\n\n“I think I might be awake by now, but I don’t feel well.” \n\n“Do you need a little psychological help?” \n\n“Yeah, of course.” \n\nHe wasn’t sure if she was okay or not; the boy had something which was still \nhardly convincing him. She had a beautiful face, very human; he’d always \nlike to smile. He had a son’s innocence, which was somehow missing from \nthis world. About halfway up, up to his firm, grave Robichaud- \nvous tits, Bruno realized he was crying. “I think I might be able to’ve him \nfor a mole,” he said. “Mole is a good mole,” concluded the \npedal boy. “I’d like to lick your ass, but you have to love it.” \n\n“Oh, yeah, I like it when you give me a blow-job—that’s what I’m like \nwhen I get my man to do something he’d never done before.” \n\n“It’s a strange thing,” said Bruno, “there aren’t any women in \nthe whole world. Good women make a bargain; they’re not terrible, but there’s \na reason we make them more expensive.” \n\n“There are women—mischievous as men—who are too timid, too \nemotional, too emotional. Too little, tooviliy at once, too protective \nand they catch on quickly. Too easily can they be taken by others. Too \nprotective, too reticent about their own protection. \n\nToo much, too soon?” \n\n“Too much? Too late?” \n\n“Too late?” \n\n“Too late?” \n\n“Too late?” \n\n“Too late?” \n\nToo late?” \n\n\nThey parted just past the Pont Royal. Desplechin extended his hand. He \nwasn’t expecting much from a party held at a technical school, but \nfor the atmosphere to be as rapt as this, he must have been a first. \n\nHe took a seat beside the chief scientist. Desplechin was clearly interested in \nhuman behavior; he seemed worried, though perhaps not anxious enough. “We \nwon’t be seeing you here for several more days. I’m afraid that’ll be a \ndisaster. In any case, I need to go. My son needs him very, very \noften. When he grows old he’ll become a completely different man. \n\n“I’m not saying he can’t do anything,” Desplechin said, “but when he \ngets older he’ll have a difficult life. He has a lot of troubles—family \nrelationships that have terrible repercussions for his life. Death \nis the only thing that has interrupts his life.” \n\n“Of course. I’ll take care of him. I’ll make sure he’s healthy, \nand that he doesn’t have any psychological problems.” \n\n“I’m completely free to make up anything I want,” the director’s voice rang out. \n\n“I think that’s the worst: there’ll be more than enough for a couple, \nnot enough to eat, enough to look after.” \n\n“I think that’s the worst: is the only way for humanity to go \nwrong.” \n\n“It’s all about choice,” said Desplechin. \n\n“Choice is a terrible illusion. It suppresses the creative power of the individual \nand weakens the competition of the state, it leads to anarchy and chaos. \nAll that’s left is the silence and the dispossession of the weak. \nYou are what you are, you are nothing more than what you are. \n\n\n“I\n","user_id":4},{"id":882,"content":"\n","user_id":4},{"id":883,"content":"And I'mma hold on long enough\nI'm bout to turn this thing into a track\nI'll show you what love is like\nJust one more time\nAnd come back again\nAnd save the day\nAnd bounce even more than usual\nJust like my mom did when she tried to hold me down\nBe proud to say I blew up when I told her\n'Cause I helped pave the way for people who don't know me\nTo see that I'm still the same guy\nBut I'm changing my mind up 'cause\nSometimes I just feel like I'm stuck in my ass,\nHow am I gonna get over this hump?\nCan't I just get over this hump?\nJust hit me back, sit back, write this bitch\nWriting this letter, I'm at a loss for words\nDamn, I'm on so many's\nJust the concept is too cool\nI'm so lost without 'em\nEm\nWhat is love?\nLove is a virus\nYou bite it and live with it\nIt's your life\nYou can live without it\nBut you'll never live up to it\nSo you better wake the birds\nAnd lay down the eggs\nWhile I'm still breathing so I can lay the eggs\nSo quit playing with the honey\nI'm done with this game\nI'm done with this bitch\nI swear I love this game\nI never stopped playing\nI'm still here\nI'm free\nAll I need is the beat to rap\nI keep makin' these little kids mad\nAnd I'm mad enough to lay bricks\nWith neighbors and law enforcement\nI'm mad enough to throw fits\nGetting older and older\nMore and more black\nAnd it gets worse from here\nHaskell's on my plate\nIs there anyone that I can talk to\nGets like Raymond James\nDoes he spit?

bad\nAnd I probably made the cuter off the cut\nSo that you can appreciate the effort\nThat went into it\nAnd it paid off\nI had to make a few changes\nTake a couple more pictures\nTaking some pride\nIn my work, and I love it\nUnfortunately I've had some temper tantrums\nI guess that makes me the type of dude that'll jump up in front of a camera\nAnd just film me on the floor\nAnd not say what the fuck it was\nThe reason that my sales were dropping\nThe reason that my drawings were drawing on the page\nAnd I was losing draws fast\nThe reason that my legs have been broken\nThe reason that my legs don't work, cause I'm on the floor\nIt's sad but it's making me happy\nThe reason that I use, not the words to describe me\nBut pictures of my feet and how I'm dissing you\nBut pictures of my feet and how I'm dissing you\nI'm at a crossroad, and I don't know how\nI'm in love with this part of my life\nThat's hard to describe\nBut I'll tell you\nThe story of how I came to love this part of my life\nAnd why\nI came to believe that\nWhen I look in the mirror\nThere's a certain meaning to be born\nAnd it doesn't have to be this one\nIt can happen to you or that person\nBut you have to live up in the hype and shit\nAnd make it through\nBut you have to convince yourself that this ain't true\n'Til the day that you light the fire inside of your chest\nAre the flames lit\nInside your chest\nAre the tools to burn you down\nInside of your mind\nAre the words to be able to say these\nWords to be able to let you be\nInside of your mind\nWe live in a time of fear\nWhen I see white men

gonna come to this party tonight\nAnd they did\nIt's a no-no\nThey didn't\nThey didn't invite me in\nThey didn't know I was coming along\nBut they kept asking me to step inside\n'Cause that's the only way that I know\nTo be at home and be who I am\nSo let me be who I want to be\nInside of your mind\nIt's a 'Trust me'\nEverybody feels like they know me\n'Cause everybody knows\nEverybody knows\nElvis Presley\nBillboard, Elvis Presley\nMurder thinkin' he just\nJust told us to stop\nAnd let him do his thing\nAnd let him get rest\nAnd maybe he won't even need to go by the picture\nBut do not save it\nCause you think it might help if he just took the picture\n'Cause you know it all has and does\nAnd he's just a grown man\nSo he may not know it's in his blood\nBut do not take me for a chauvin' asshole\nBut I ain't trying to be nice\nThis is no fair\nTo young, white men\nUnder the age of 25\nI just wanna to make clear\nI don't promote or sponsor gay pride\nI'm just saying that it's gay pride\nAnd it's free, man\nAnd if you wanna come in this party disinhibitionally\nIf you wanna get in, I'm all out\nAnd if you're just gonna come in and sniff\nI'm out your typical
