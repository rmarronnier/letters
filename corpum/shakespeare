  ANGELO. O, I am dead, and all is lost!
    And now I am a ghost, and it is my duty
    To purge the business of my soul.
  CAMILLO. I have lost myself,
    And I am damn'd for't.
  ANGELO. I have.
  CAMILLO. My soul's afeard; he that hath the body
    Must make the grave.
  ANGELO. Most heinous!
    I mean to be reveng'd on him.
                                                                                  Exit Lady.
    We have your happiness; you that have
    Whose country's most bounteous bounty are
    Due for your deaths.
  CAMILLO. I'll pay it, I say.
    I am a vice as rich as money.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  O you, my lord,
    One that lives an hour where no life lasts,
    But still makes a virtue, and a virtue
    That lives in death.
  ANGELO.  [To PORTIA]  That's a good man;
    And that's the way to die.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  So, good man!
    If I have spoken all the truth, I'll say
    There is no virtue but this: it is the
    Death of the damned.
  ANGELO.  [To PORTIA]  So, so.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  Yet that's true too;
    For virtue is not a virtue but
    A virtue that dies in virtue.
  ANGELO.  [To PORTIA]  And that's true too.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  But that's true too;
    For virtue is not the death of the damned.
    For virtue is not the death of the damned.
  ANGELO.  [To PORTIA]  Why, then he dies toil in virtue.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  Therefore virtue is not dead toil.
  ANGELO.  [To PORTIA]  And that's true too.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  Yet that's true too;
    For virtue is not dead toil but in virtue.
  ANGELO.  [To PORTIA]  And that's true too;
    For virtue is not dead toil but in virtue.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  But that's true too;
    For virtue is not dead toil but in virtue.
  ANGELO.  [To PORTIA]  And that's true too;
    For virtue is not dead toil but in virtue.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  And that's true too;
    For virtue is not dead toil but in virtue.
  ANGELO.  [To PORTIA]  But that's true too;
    For virtue is not dead toil but in virtue.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  And that's true too;
    For virtue is not dead toil but in virtue.
  ANGELO.  [To PORTIA]  And that's true too;
    For virtue is not dead toil but in virtue.
  PORTIA.  [To ANGELO]  'Tis true too;
    For virtue is not dead toil but in virtue.

====================
    Or do you not know what's in't?
  TITINIUS. No, sir. The matter is, my lord.
    The Duke of Milan, in his peace, was given
    To such a man as he, and was
    Of twenty brothers present.
  LUCIUS.
    A great one, my lord.
  TITINIUS. My lord?
  LUCIUS. As great as himself; for he was
    Of twenty brothers present.
  TITINIUS. So great as I was thus much in love
    With this most noble gentleman!
    But how did he bring our Lord of Milan
    To him?
  LUCIUS. He brought us, my lord.
  TITINIUS. And when he was come
    To make his peace, he, being of such
    A noble mind, and of such friends,
    Came to see our Lady Comanius,
    Whom he was in intelligence of
    The very very danger he was in.
    To-day she came to visit him; and now
    Her dear acquaintance is coming to
    The Duke of Milan.
  LUCIUS. What news?
  TITINIUS. I pray, my lord;
    I know not what I would have said.
  LUCIUS. What news, good my lord?
  TITINIUS. I told you, my lord, there was no remedy
    But that the King should have spoke with his brother;
    But I know his mouth is gilded with words,
    And sure his letters are full of good tidings.
    But what?
  LUCIUS. What?
  TITINIUS. His letters are all empty, and great tidings
    Are every day's affairs sent by him.
  LUCIUS. What, what?
  TITINIUS. No matter if your lordship had been so bold
    To give him letters of your royal pleasure.
  LUCIUS. Then tell me, noble Hector; what letters?
  TITINIUS. Letters, my lord, that your lordship sent to him
    After his own studies.
  LUCIUS. Why, then, he sent them to my lord,
    Upon what order?
  TITINIUS. Take it from him, my lord, that you list
    The contents of his letters, which
    The Duke of Milan hath sent for you.
  LUCIUS. What, what?
  TITINIUS. First, that he hath sent you letters of love,
    That's all the contents of his letters.
  LUCIUS. What, what?
  TITINIUS. First, that you send him letters of desire
    That he brings to you from a child-like friend
    A man that his love cannot love;  
    And first, that his letters come from you;
    Which, my lord, is to be hated by him,
    For he thinks them false, and so sends you
    The receipt of his love.
  LUCIUS. What, what?
  TITINIUS. First, that he loves you, and in good time,
    And then, that you send him letters of desire
    That he brings to you from a dangerous
    Of some wrongs that he hath committed.
  LUCIUS. How, what?
  TITINIUS. First, that he loves you in such a kind
    That you send him letters of desire
    That you know he has you in ill labour;
    And lastly, that you send him letters of desire
    That you know he is a coward, and that he
    Is in a civil way removed to school.
    What, what?
  TITINIUS. First, that you dislike him, and that you
    Tell him how you hated him, and tell him
    How you now think he is a villain.
  LUCIUS. What, what, what?
  TITINIUS. First, that you do dislike him, and that
    You know he is a villain, and so tell him
    How you dislike

    All where she seems to be, do Jove's daughter move!
    I was amazed at these thoughts;

    The gem in the deep of the deep of the forest

====================
    But not so
    As you think.
  SIR TOBY. My lord,
    Well, I thought my ancient advice would make him
    To throw away his old counsels, or to give it in
    A new way.
  BRUTUS. So will this advice,
    To him that takes it.
  SIR TOBY. Give him a good report,
    And let him do you service;
    And, for his sake, say what I have said so far:
    That the Emperor is a Roman, and his
    The son of a Roman; and his claim upon Rome
    Must be, by his service, admir'd. But what think you
    That I have so grossly misconstrued thy
    Great and ancient advice, and that now have
    Within my power, too late taken my advice?
  BRUTUS. You shall know this by my meaning.
  SIR TOBY. My lord,
    I cannot tell what to say, but I think
    It is my duty, when I shall have the time
    To say what I have done.  
  BRUTUS. If thou wilt not know what I have said,
    Thou art a poor man.
  SIR TOBY. My lord,
    I would that you had been my father, and
    My uncle's son.
  BRUTUS. My lord,
    If I were your father, I would be yours,
    Your uncle's son, and yours too.
  SIR TOBY. My lord,
    As I did tell thee, I did call upon you
    To thank me for the advice I gave you.
  BRUTUS. As I was your uncle, I did give him
    The very thing I had given him.
  SIR TOBY. Your uncle,
    Your uncle, the very thing I did devise
    That I should make him my subject.
  BRUTUS. As I have told thee,  
    I did give you the very thing I had given
    Your uncle; and in the giving of it
    He gave me the very thing I had given
    Your uncle; and in the giving of it
    He gave me the very thing I had given
    Your uncle.
  SIR TOBY. My lord,
    I am glad you have not given me a suit,
    But I am glad you will not give me a suit
    That I shall not win.
  BRUTUS. I warrant you, my uncle,
    Your uncle, I know you well; and I
    Am glad that you have not given me a suit
    But I will not win.
  SIR TOBY. My lord,
    There is no suit; but I will win;
    And, my lord, you are my father.
  BRUTUS. I know you well.
  SIR TOBY. The suit that I gave to him for the compliment
    I gave to him for, I tell you, is no suit;
    But I am glad that you have not given me
    Your father, or mine, a suit against my
    suit.
  BRUTUS. And I'll win, my lord,
    By giving you a suit against my suit.
  SIR TOBY. My lord,
    You may win if you may win; but I will
    Win if I have a father I will not give.
  BRUTUS. I warrant you, my uncle,
    The very thing I had given him, or her, or that
    He gave, or any of you, are yours;
    And in the giving of it, he gave me the very thing
    I gave to him.
  SIR TOBY. My lord,
    I would have won, if there had been no father,
    My uncle, father, or son, but my father.
  BRUTUS. And I'll win, my lord,
    If you had had one.                          Exit

    What news abroad?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. What news?
  FIRST SOLDIER. Ay, my good lord.
    How now, my good lady?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. You are come, my lord;
    How come this news?
  FIRST SOLDIER. I hope, my lord, it is true.

    What is this, my lord?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. This is the parcel of your letter,
    That I sent to my friend to-day.
    Your brother sent it, my lord, but you
    Did not receive it; for he sends you
    'Good master, your letters are come.
    I pray you, tell me how I may recover them.                   Exit PRINCESS.
    The noble Prince of Wales, your son, and the Duke
    Of York, have I his letters to-day;
    And I hope, on their return, you shall find
    Your brother's son shall desire to have them.
    You shall know how I may obtain them.

    What is this, my lord?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Here comes the Duke of York.
    My brother is not yet come to us, and
    We are in haste.
    You do know the Duke will not be off till
    The Duke himself be at the Duke's pleasure.
    But, Warwick, I think you may find yourself
    In some quarrel between the Duke and me;
    For, think you, your father sent me these letters,
    Not unguarded from his knowledge,
    But with a secret promise of my love
    That I should be her true attendant.
    Tell me, Warwick, is this true, and
    Will you trust me with the Duke in this?
  KING HENRY. Your father sends me letters to-day,
    And, Warwick, is this true.
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. My lord, I know it is true.
  KING HENRY. True in faith too, when, Warwick, I
    Am in love with the Prince of Wales.
  KING HENRY. In faith too, as I remember, or myself.
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Your love of the Duke is most noble,
    And worthy yours of the land.
  KING HENRY. And such a love, by the Duke,
    As is your father's, is like the Duke.
    So is your love in love, and such love,
    That I am, for your love, his honest friend.
  KING HENRY. And so is my love in love.  

                     
====================
    Would be a worthy revenge.
    I'll be sworn   I am not the King's son.
    Farewell, my liege, farewell; farewell, my liege.
                                                   Exeunt King, Queen, and Players
    Well, my liege; I am dying of a fever.
    My brother's death, my brother's death,
    My brother's death, his death; I am dying o' th' King.
    I'll go with my brother, I'll not stay till I come.                    Exeunt

    Thy sire would have given thee leave to speak!

                                               [Alarum]  
  Alarum.  [To the Fool]  I pray you, Jack;
    And think upon your honour and fortune,
    To do me good and to the best of my power
    To make this quarrel a peace.                                           [Alarum]  I pray you, Jack;
    And, if you will, to be a witness to this.
    [To Horatio]  I was but a fool, Jack;
    And now I am full to my wit, and shall fail
    When I can prove my wit up to my heart.
                                                        [Alarum]    Good Jack!
    [To Horatio]  You have done well, Jack; but now
    You have been a fool, Jack; and such folly
    As I am now.
  Hor. No, Jack; I am a fool.
  Fool. Jack, a fool! O, Jack, a fool!
  Hor. I am a fool.  [To Horatio]  I pray you, Jack;
    And think upon your honour and fortune,
    To do me good and to the best of my power
    To make this quarrel a peace.                              Exit.

                           Re-enter Lear, with a letter

  Lear. My lord, where have you sent this letter?
  Fool. [Reads] 'Your honour and fortune, Jack,
    To do me good and to the best of my power.'
  Lear. 'What, 'our honour and fortune?' What, my lord?
  Lear. 'Your honour and fortune, Horatio.'
  Hor. What, Horatio!
  Lear. 'Your honour and fortune, Jack,
    You have lost your friends and your friends' names.
    I must give you another letter with
    Your honour and fortune, Horatio.
    My honour and fortune, Jack,
    I do give you a letter of the like sort.
    If you do it out of respect, my lord,
    I'll write you a thousand pound, if you do it
    Out of respect of that honour you have lost.
                                                              [Alarum]  
  Lear. To make this quarrel a peace?
  Hor. No, my lord, not to make it peace.
  Lear. Who is this?
  Hor. This man, my lord.
  Lear. How say you?
  Hor. I know not, my lord.
  Lear. How say you?
  Hor. No, indeed.
  Lear. How say you?
  Hor. I know not, my lord.
  Lear. What say you?
  Hor. I know not, my lord.
  Lear. I would rather hear how I was wrong'd than
    How I am given to say I was wrong'd.
    O, I am a fool now, Jack!
  Hor. I will be so old, my lord, when I am old.
  Lear. Why, then you are fool'd too.
  Hor. Why, then you are too old; for, Horatio,
    Why, Horatio, you are too old.
  Lear. What art thou?
  Hor. I pray thee tell me.
  Lear. What art thou?  
 
====================
    Hush!
                                                                                 Exit PANDARUS

                                 Enter A MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. Dear madam,
    Your Grace knows my father was a physician.
    I have seen him perform a cure for my  
    Haply small fever; and in the meantime,
    In the name of the gods, he doth drive his country
    To armed action against the citizens.
    Your Grace, a physician's name, is a word
    That not only speaks Iago's mind, but
    Shall be in my mind once more.
  LUCENTIO. Well, good madam, I at least am sure
    He will not be born to to Jove's bill.
  MESSENGER. Marry, indeed, my father died a Roman,
    And after his death his wife, wife, and children;
    And from her daughter his son, whom now
    He hath married to the younger fair Katherine.
    And this same Katherine, by some miracle,
    Hath now her daughter, sister, and son;
    And by the miracle she is found,
    He hath married her, and is his wife and son.
    And so, good my lord,
    I'll be bold to call him a peaceable
    And unmeritable.
  LUCENTIO. I see he will not be born to Jove's bill.
    He shall, madam.
  PANDARUS. He shall not be born to Jove's bill, sir.
    I do believe him to be a peaceable man.
    But I do believe him to be a Christian.
  LUCENTIO. Faith, if he be born to a Christian,
    He shall not be in Jove's bill!
  A MESSENGER. A miracle indeed!
    I never heard of such a miracle.
  PANDARUS. How can you, madam?
    You have a husband and a wife? Am I not sure
    The man shall be his wife and wife and wife?
    I do not know what miracle a miracle will,
    But I pray you tell me; for all the world there's one
    That will not be his wife and wife, how  
    Will he marry his brother? Or whither he goes,
    And what comes before him?
  LUCENTIO. But I know you are a Christian
    And would have him marry his brother.
  PANDARUS. I'll tell you, madam, a miracle will
    Happen.
  LUCENTIO. The miracle will come.
  A MESSENGER. But I know you are a Christian;
    And think you should marry your brother.
  PANDARUS. I am a Christian, and wish him marry his brother.
    To him, marry my brother!
  LUCENTIO. Faith, I am not a Christian, but wish him marry his brother.
    But I know you are an honest man, and wish him
    To marry his brother; and if he should marry his brother,
    He should marry his brother too.
  A MESSENGER. I pray you tell me, if you were so sure
    That he should marry your brother, you should marry your brother.
    But if he should marry his brother, he should marry my brother.
    Or else that I should be your husband,
    And you your wife, and you your husband,
    And that you were your husband and wife,
    That you were your husband and wife, and you your husband,
    That you were your husband and wife, and you your husband,
    That you were your husband and wife, and you your husband,

====================
    With our courtiers, more dangerous,
    Than ever before, and more valiant than men,
    Have we at our court any of these?  
    No; now I see them with my soul, and I will
    Give them my due. What, when I have made a friend
    That will forswear to swear his love, and pledge
    His love to this man in my love?
  BRUTUS. I'll swear then that I will not;
    For life in me is dear, but not born of love.
    A man that is truly blest!
    And that is my hope.
  BRUTUS. Your hope is in my love's love, and is
    A hope that you but lack.
  BRUTUS. I hope I have not had your love; I hope not
    Your love, but have been your friend, and am your friend
    To my friend. If I have been your friend, then I
    Will be yours to keep, and that is your friend.
  BRUTUS. Had I not your friend, my friend would make
    My friend famous, and make me a Roman's friend.
    But if I have not been your love, my friend
    Would make me a fool and my friend,
    And make me a fool and my friend.
  BRUTUS. And my friend
    Could make you laugh, or make you cry, or
    Cry 'Good friend!' or 'Good friend!' or 'Good friend!' to one else.
    But I am not yours to keep, and that
    Is my friend.
  BRUTUS. Nor my friend.
  BRUTUS. Your friend's friend's friend's friend's friend is not yours.
  BRUTUS. And your friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend
    is not yours.
  BRUTUS. Your friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's  
    friend's friend is yours.
  BRUTUS. You are not mine,
    And mine's not yours.
  BRUTUS. I know you well.
  LUCIUS. Prithee, noble Brutus, speak more softly.
  BRUTUS. Speak more softly, and you shall be sure
    You have nothing to fear.
  BRUTUS. I am no coward: I have done all I can.
  BRUTUS. I have done all, and I'll do it to many,
    But nothing that's worth saving.
  BRUTUS. You lose, and you lose; I lose.
  LUCIUS. I'll lose nothing, and I'll lose nothing.
  BRUTUS. You lose nothing, and you lose nothing.
  BRUTUS. You lose nothing, and you lose nothing.
  LUCIUS. Of nothing, I lose nothing!
  BRUTUS. Of nothing, I lose nothing!
  LUCIUS. And I lose nothing, and I lose nothing.
  BRUTUS. What, I lose nothing, and I lose nothing?
  LUCIUS. I lose nothing, and I lose nothing.

                              Enter SICINIUS

  SICINIUS. Thou, Antony, art a Roman.
  BRUTUS. And here's a difference of words.
  SICINIUS. Thou art a Roman, and thou art a Roman.
  BRUTUS. I am thou, Antony.
  SICINIUS. I am thou, Antony.
  BRUTUS. I am thou, Antony.
  SICINIUS. I am thou, Antony.
  BRUTUS. I am thou, Antony.
  SICINIUS. Thou hast stabb'd me in my house.
  BRUTUS. I have slain thee, and thou art a Roman.
  SICINIUS. I have slain thee, and thou art a Roman.
  BRUTUS. I would I were thy enemy.
  SICINIUS. I would I were thy enemy.
  BRUTUS. I would I were thy enemy.
  SICINIUS. I would I

    My cousin Thurio took him to court,

  KING. How doth your cousin?
    He hath a great deal of fat in him.
  CATESBY. He's like as a poor man in a desert place.
  KING. You may say he's a gentleman of the people.
  CATESBY. I am sure he has a great deal of fat in him.
  KING. Why, so does he, and so hath he a great deal of fat.
    No matter, my lord; I'll tell you what, I am as mad as he.
    You know he was a gentleman of the people.
    Some of these gentlemen have been my friends;
    Some have done me favours.
  CATESBY. It is my fault that I were born a gentleman.
  KING. Yet he hath a great deal of fat in him.
    Was it not this fat that I got in him?
    Why, this fat, I warrant, that he hath fat in him.
    This fat, I warrant, that he hath fat in him.

  KING. What's the matter?
    Wast not the fool for thy passion?
  NORFOLK. No, my lord; it is because thou art so good at it.
  KING. What fool is that?
  NORFOLK. A fool that, as thou say'st, doth love me.
    I am but as good at it as thou art.
  KING. Why, then, I'll tell thee, and what fool is that?
  NORFOLK. A fool that, as thou say's, doth despise me.

  PISANIO. Beseech your Highness,
    If any thing he do wish to you,
    He shall find it good; and in his grief
    If any, he shall be most happy.
  TAMORA. I dare say, my lord, that nothing he would wish
    I should think to me.

    A strange passion in his eye
    And with a strange eye he looks to heaven,
    And to the sun, and to the stars, and to the spheres;
    And it seems to him that holy vows are made;
    That are made in love, but not made by heaven.
    Who makes the vows that makes the vows is holy?
    Who is the holy man that makes them, if they be?
    Or is it not you? What is the holy man?
    And who is not holy? Then are you not holy?
    For if you are not holy, why is not the world?
    Therefore, holy, be not so holy:
    But be holy, and be holy holy holy holy.
    For if you are not holy, who is not holy?
    And who is not holy? Then be not holy, and be holy.
    And to be holy is to be holy, holy holy holy.

  KING HENRY. It is note-book to thee, good madam.

    You have but little or nothing of what I know.

  BERTRAM. I am sorry that I have been thus long entreated;
    But God make me thankful for what I have learned.
  KING HENRY. Madam, I was a gentleman.

    You have not a cause to refuse me your son.

    What the hell is he? And what doth he love?
    What's he? Why, what a foolish fellow!
    Who would say he was a traitor? No, a thief!
    Were he not a traitor, this would be
    A monstrous deed; and such treason
    Would be a very monstrous thing  
    That could not possibly be done.
    But what is he? And what is he? Who calls?
    There is a certain in Padua, whom I know,
    And I know myself, and I know thee,
    That would be a traitor.

At a public place

Enter PROTEUS, GREMIO, and OFFICERS with others

  PROTEUS. Go, good Verges, go seek out the man you saw in the ring;
    Tell him what the matter is, and bid him be merry.
                                                                               Exit GREMIO
  OFFICER. Go, good Verges.
  PROTEUS. Thanks, good Officer.
  OFFICER. Will you believe that I have bought the ring I saw?
  PROTEUS. I did.
  OFFICER. I pray you, keep in mind that I am a Jew.
  PROTEUS. It is to enjoy the Jew, and I will be
    no more than a beggar.
  OFFICER. I am sorry, sir, for your sorrows, and to have
    your answer.
  PROTEUS. I have been a beggar too, and shall be paid by charity.
    My father- I mean my father, my mother, and all;
    And he that is not the Jew is a beggar too.
    I drink and speak in the streets, and have been a beggar too.
    But now I am a beggar too.
  OFFICER. You are a beggar too; you are a beggar too.
  PROTEUS. I will not allow it, sir, but I will be as good
    as beggary.
  OFFICER. I'll be answer'd.  
  PROTEUS. I will say no more.
  OFFICER. Sir, I will not.
  PROTEUS. Come, come, come, come; come, come, come; come, come, come, come;
    come, come, come, come, come; come, come, come, come; come, come, come;  
    come, come, come, come, come; come, come, come; come, come, come;       Exit

  SHYLOCK. Bloody vulture!
  KING. So you have a hart in your head and a horse in the back.
                                                                                     Exit
  THOMAS. No, my lord.
  KING. It is the deputy's duty.
    The King is come to answer.
  SHYLOCK. What is his answer?
  KING. To the charge of mine own goodness.
    The duties of my father were of no consequence
    In the time of his death.
  THOMAS. That is too much of our duty.
  KING. It is not a fault the King cannot bear.
    His father's name is very near the point,
    And he is the son of an elder brother.
    On the contrary, my lord, the son of a brother,
    Who once, but a shadow had been born in me,
    That was not here.
  THOMAS. To the contrary!
  KING. In your own good stead, my lord,
    I think it is. I must not bethink myself,
    I know you are not King, that you should be thus.
    My father, being grown a prince,
    Hath made himself a king by your looks,
    And now you are a beggar. A beggar!
    My father, by my life, hath stol'n him a king.  
    I have not been a king in your sight but I have
    In mine eye.
  KING. So this is the way to be king:  
    To be King by your looks.
  THOMAS. And yet the way is foul;
    There is no remedy; you may be King
    And have the objects of your looks.
  KING. You may indeed, my lord,
    If you follow the Prince, stand aught but wrong
    On your royal head.
    But what of the Duke?
  THOMAS. His Grace, having been King, hath thus been made
    A beggar. He is now a king.
  KING. What is his Grace?
  THOMAS. A beggar, my lord;
    And will not be so after his Grace.
    The Prince is the man.
  KING. What is his son?
  THOMAS. A woman.
  KING. Were that a beggar, what of the Prince?
  THOMAS. As a beggar, by my life.
  KING. What of his Grace?
  THOMAS. As a beggar, by my life.
  KING. What of his Grace?
  THOMAS. As a woman.
  KING. What of his Grace?  
  THOMAS. As a beggar, by my life.
  KING. What of his Grace?
  THOMAS. As a beggar, by my life.
  KING. What of his Grace?
  THOMAS. As a woman.
  KING. What of his Grace?
  THOMAS. As a woman.
  KING. What of his Grace?
  THOMAS. As a beggar, by my life.

  DOLABELLA. O, that my good aunt would speak to me!
  KING. Good aunt, you have given me cause to fear.
  DOLABELLA. If you fear me, I'll be true; if not, I'll lie.
  KING. And if I do not, tell me how I did wrong you;
    For I would know how you came unto my love.
  DOLABELLA. O, tell me, cousin, how I came to you.
  KING. I never had a quarrel with my aunt.
  DOLABELLA. I never had one, but I do remember
    My aunt gave me such a quarrel that, in her eyes,
    My worst fault was, I spake of him.
  KING. In this most abhorr'd fault, my aunt gave me
    You with a strange distemper to draw upon me.
    My sorrows, my woes, were ever mine own; but
    Wherefore, in your eyes, did you see what I did,
    Or what I did in yours?
  DOLABELLA. I know what I did to my aunt.
  KING. Did I not think that there should be a fault?
  DOLABELLA. On my life, I think you did. But, cousin,
    I do beseech you, let us all be merry;
    And if you will be merry, let us all be merry.
                                                          Exeunt

    What, indeed, art thou such a woman?  
  DIANA. Why, Agender, I would weep.
    Alas, poor man! wot thou not love?
  ANTONIO. Yes, Agender; I would weep.
  DIANA. Now say what thou wilt do with me if thou hast any
    money.
  ANTONIO. Ay, but nothing.
  DIANA. Well, that's not a woman's fault.
    What, indeed, thou wilt say I am a man?
  DIANA. No; thou hast no soul, man.
  ANTONIO. Ay, but thou art a man.
  DIANA. 'Tis true, indeed.
  DIANA. But thou art not a man, is't not?
  ANTONIO. No, indeed; but thou art not a man.
  DIANA. But thou art not a man, is't not?
  DIANA. If not, then I am; if not, then I am.
    What, indeed? Is that love?
  ANTONIO. Ay, but thou speak'st of love; who says so?
  DIANA. Ay, but a man.
  DIANA. What say'st thou?
  ANTONIO. Ay, but a woman.
  DIANA. What say'st thou?
  DIANA. Say indeed, I am a woman.
    What say'st thou?
  DIANA. 'Tis love's semblance that art thou a woman.
  ANTONIO. Ay, but a man.
  DIANA. You are more in love with men than with women;
    For love is a woman.
  DIANA. O, but thou art not a woman;
    But thou art not a man, is't not?

  TIMON. And yet here's a cause of my goodness.

SCENE III.
Rome. A street
====================
CORIOLANUS. O, think how you would have us think!
    You would say you would have us think,
    Since you would say we would bethink of
    The worst in the world; and you would say
    That the worst in the world was worse than
    You and I. But you would say we were better than
    We were; so that we would think you were fainto

    Be more noble than noble. But if you
    If you were not thought to be a murther,

    To think that I are so.
  TIMON. I will pray you, my lord,
    To think
====================
I never thought the Duke of York's son to be a
    good soldier, but upon the contrary he was a soldier
    worthy of the rebel cause. There was a notable man,
    Sir John Rowland, who, like the Duke of York, was from
    Normandy and from the north, in his service of the
    French at Calais, was a friend of mine.
    Good Sir John, trust not my words; on my heart I say
    I would never have been a soldier.
  SIR JOHN RATCLIFF. Your Lord of Lancaster, I pray you, and on your
    heart; I love your lordship, I love your friends, and I
    believe in England that all men are alike.
  LEWIS PRINCESS OF FRANCE. What, lords?
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Aye, aye; but I have heard of men of such
    quality, and of men of such qualities.
  SIR JOHN RATCLIFF. My Lord of Lancaster, I pray you, I would not
    have been a soldier if I had known not the nobility of
    France.
  LEWIS PRINCESS OF FRANCE. I would have been a soldier, you saw; I love your
    lordship.
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. I would do you good; I would have said good morning.
                                                        Exit SIR JOHN RATCLIFF
  SIR JOHN RATCLIFF. 'Tis not so; 'tis not so.
    But when you have so finished your speeches, do you not
    perceive the end of your great study?
  LEWIS PRINCESS OF FRANCE. I do perceive it.
  SIR JOHN RATCLIFF. I do perceive it.
                                                 Exit SIR JOHN RATCLIFF
    But, Sir John, is it possible that
    Such a man should be in our court, and have
    His speeches so long?
  GUILDFORT. Sir, I cannot tell; it is not possible
    That this man should have his speeches so long.
  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. I shall know your mind; I'll tell you what:
    A man of great learning and a man of great judgment,
    A man of great learning and a man of great judgment,
    A man of great judgment, and of great judgment,
    A man of great judgment, and of great judgment,
    And of great judgment and great judgment,
    And of great judgment and great judgment,
    To be a judge, and to be a judge;
    But I beseech you, sir, let's see your speeches.
                                         Exeunt PRINCESS and GUILDFORT
    But to the very point of the course of words
    Whose full meaning is to effect the end
    Of your great learning and your great judgment
    Let me hear this speech.
  PRINCESS. In faith, sir, I do not know what it is.
    But, sir, I beseech you, let's hear it.  
                                                   Exeunt




SCENE II.
France. The DUKE'S palace

Enter DUKE, GUILDFORT, and OFFICERS

  DUKE. What is your will?
  GUILDFORT. My will, my lord.
  DUKE. It is a curse to serve without the will;
    But, I beseech you, let's see it.
  DUKE. Well,

ACT IV. SCENE I.
Pisa. A street

Enter FAIRY, in a gown; CHARMIAN, in a gown, attended

  FAIRY. 'Tis very late; 'tis late.
  CHARMIAN. By my soul, 'tis late.
  FAIRY. Well, I'll be in the time.
  CHARMIAN. By my soul, 'tis late.
  CHARMIAN. By my soul, 'tis late.
                                                                                Exit FAIRY

                    Enter LAUNCELOT

  LAUNCELOT. Alas, my lord, it is dark; we have not seen you.
    I have heard the King say that his daughter is
    To thee, my fair lady, is no match.
  LAUNCELOT. O, our daughter!
  LAUNCELOT. The King himself hath described her,
    And said she was unnatural; and there is no
    Reason why he should not take her in that sense  
    And give her to my daughter-my sister with him.
  LAUNCELOT. In such a case is not she fair;
    For, as he says, the King had her to marry.
  LAUNCELOT. The King himself has said so; but let's hear him.
                                                   Exit LAUNCELOT
  LAUNCELOT. I am sorry, sir, that I have not
    Deserv'd the entertainment of your gracious guest.
    I have a daughter, and my soul is full
    Of woes and joys that I have borne to you.
    My daughter, I assure thee, is too young,
    And not young enough to be my wife.
    I pray, sir, what means my wife is too young?
    A man is old enough to be my wife.
    But what says the Queen to this?
  LAUNCELOT. It is a fault of yours, my lord:
    She is too young to be her wife.
  LAUNCELOT. Another fault, my lord, is that she is too young.
    But that's no fault at all on my part,
    For to her age my hopes are too weak,
    And my hopes for my daughter too weak.
    But that's a fault of my fault too young.
    I know I have fault'd my son, my daughter,
    And given my daughter to a man whose fault
    I cannot excuse. I have fault'd myself
    That I have married a man whose fault
    I have divorced my daughter, and have left her.
    I have fault'd myself that I have married
    A man whose fault I have divorced myself;
    And I have married a man whose fault I have

                          Enter ANTONY

  ANTONY. All this villainy and the villainy of the time shall make me blush,
    That I may with a little note, with lights of incense,
    Show the face of the King.
  LEONTES. Remember thy good master.  
  ANTONY. 'Twas thy master, and that good master, Antony.
  LEONTES. There was a time, and a little time, that he lived,
    And thou art a villain.
  ANTONY. 'Twas all villainy;
    For villainy is villainy at a time and a little.
    This time is villainy's time.
  LEONTES. Here is my copy of that letter.
  ANTONY. O villain! Thou villain!
    The King is a villain: 'tis not thy little villain
    That dost make thee villain.
  LEONTES. Thou villain!
    The villain is an old villain; we are villainies.
  ANTONY. I know't, villain.
  LEONTES. Thou villain! O villain! Thou villain!
  ANTONY. I think thou art villain.
  LEONTES. 'Tis not thy villain.
    But, villain, thou art a villain.
  ANTONY. I think so too.
  LEONTES. 'Tis not thy villain.
  ANTONY. I think it be a villain to be an old villain.
    Men are villainies, and they are old men:
    Thou villain! Thou villain! Thou villain!
    Thou villain! Thou villain! Thou villain!
    Thou villain!                                                                   Exit LEONTES
    But now I come to this question.
  LEONTES. Ay, that it be so.
  LEONTES. Then may I be a villain in the time to come.
    But to say I am villain is to say I am old.
    But villain-like, villain-like, I must be old.
    Villainy is a kind of villain.                                          [Exit ANTONY]
    If it be so, then old villain will be old villain.
    So, if it be so, that is my fault.
    If it be so, that is my fault.
  LEONTES. Why, that's my fault right and wrong; and his fault is my fault.
    And so, if it be so, that is my fault.
    And so, that is my fault.
  ANTONY. I am sorry for thee, villain; thou shalt not have it.
    Thou art old, thou art old, thou art villain.
  LEONTES. What, thou villain?
    Thou hast a villainous villain in thy head.
  ANTONY. I am sorry for thee, villain; thou shalt not have it.
  LEONTES. What, thou villain?
    Thou have a villainous villain in thy head.
  ANTONY. I am sorry for thee, villain; thou shalt not have it.
  LEONTES. What, thou villain?
    Thou hast a villainous villain in thy head.
  ANTONY. I am sorry for thee, villain; thou shalt not have it.
  LEONTES. What, thou villain?
    Thou hast a villainous villain in thy head.

    Some of you have been my fellows; but I know you are strangers.
    You have been a gentleman of the highest estimation;
    That which I shall say I do not think I have.
    I will be thy friend in the war, and with all my heart
    Seek to be a soldier, and have no other friends;
    I am but a gentleman to the best of my blood,
    And by my fortune I am well know'd for it.
    Yet I am not a soldier. I have not fought for Italy;
    Nor I have not fought for Italy. The gods are much in love
    With me, and I am confident in that.
    I have not fought for Italy; I have not fought for him-
    And this 'no other friends'- I have not fought for him.
    And yet I am not a soldier. I have not fought for him.
    But this 'no other friends'- I have not fought for him,
    Nor had no fight for him, nor had no fight for him.

    Nor had no fight for him, nor had no fight for him;
    Nor had no fight for him, nor had no fight for him.
    But this 'I have fought for him and him have not fought,
    For me and for him both are friends;
    Had I been one, I would have fought for him.

    And this 'I have fought for him and him have not fought,

A seaport in Agincourt. A hall in the DUKE'S palace

Enter LAUNCE, OTHERS, and BARDOLPH

  LAFEU. I have never seen such a bed; but what a bed
    Hath been in the hostess' chamber
    That all the beauty of the room hath appeared
    In my dreams, to be admired once more.
    The duke hath left her a bed where ever she was,
    And now she sleeps in it; and yet the duke teacheth her
    That she, the very air, which breathes and doth breathe,
    Hath a delicate air, and, apart from that,  
    Does not seem to breathe, doth seem to die.
    But would these dreams be true?
  LAFEU. So they are, and so are they.
  LAUNCE. So, in that they are true;
    And then, I hope, they come true.
  BARDOLPH. I am sorry, sir, for my vow,
    To be contented with dreams,
    But I am contented with my house.
  LAFEU. But I am contented with dreams!
    But I am contented with my house.
  LAUNCE. Nay, it is my dream.
    And yet I have the devil here in my head
    That gives me bed.
  BARDOLPH. I have given myself up to your lordship,
    And to your lordship; therefore you shall hear,
    That 'twixt the sheets I sleep I have not slept.
  LAFEU. O, then you had been in your dreams then.
    You have seen these women.
  LAUNCE. O! now I see, now I see.
    Now I see!
  BARDOLPH. Alas, my lord, I am sorry
    The bed of comfort I have slept upon
    Is so dear that I am sorry
    I have not slept upon it. This is the way
    To comfort myself.
  LAFEU. Well, my lord, this is the way to heaven.

    The Plains of Arno are full of wind
    That blows upon the habitation
    Of Enceladus; he sleeps like a shadow.
    A plague upon thy company!
    Thoughts of age do outlive time,
    And men's loves live on barren barren barren.

    For the time is full of new friends and new foes.
    Look you, the gods will not think of thee.
    The time's full of new friends and new foes.
    What doth thou think of me?
  CAIUS. The gods, I know not what to think of thee.
    Think not of me, for time is full of new friends and new foes.
    Think not of me, for thou hast been of late
    A man of great fortune and a king.
    Think not of me, for thou hast been in time too.
    Think not of me, for thou hast been in time too.

FIRST MERCHANT. Well, sir, I hope you have good things in mind.
FIRST MERCHANT. There is something in our manners that is very unnatural.
SECOND MERCHANT. This is the very virtue of youth,
and the boy is the man to do it.
FIRST MERCHANT. It is in his nature, I think, as he is;
for the man is a man of many virtues.
FIRST MERCHANT. In virtue, sir, the boy is very well;
for he is a very virtuous and a virtuous
man,
and one that is young.
SECOND MERCHANT. As I may say, sir, it is a gentleman
of many virtues,
that he is a gentleman of many virtues,
that he is very well;
though he is not in the common good, he is well.
FIRST MERCHANT. Good sir, I dare say well, and I hope well;
though he is indeed in the common good.
SECOND MERCHANT. Then, sir, do you love yourself well?
FIRST MERCHANT. I do, sir; and my love hath been in me
for many a dear year.
SECOND MERCHANT. And your dear friend is well.
FIRST MERCHANT. So, sir, I would say well, and I hope well.
SECOND MERCHANT. And yours, sir, is well.

  SERVANT. No, indeed, I think no; but, sir, I do know him
    To be a gentleman of many virtues.
  GUIDERIUS. If virtue be not so fine as it is,
    Virtue, I should say, might be so alike
    As make a man of virtue: virtue is,
    As a man of virtue, as a gentleman;
    And therefore, I beseech you, determine what virtue
    Is so alike.
  SERVANT. Yes, sir.

  BARDOLPH. Hail, my sweet Bardolph!  
  BARDOLPH. Ha!
  BARDOLPH. I thank a thousand gods, Bardolph, for thy Grace's good pleasure!
    No matter, Bardolph, that you shall desire me
    To love-love you best I can,
    If I love you by any chance.
  BARDOLPH. Come, with me to my chamber; I'll attend
    On that which we have interr'd, which we shall call
    The sessions, that the lover may attend.                             Exit
  BARDOLPH. Sweet Bardolph, let me see your sister;
    Though I have a sister in my bosom, she's
    A very gentleman; yet he is such a villain
    That I must forswear all such terms.
  BARDOLPH. Come, come, Bardolph.                                Exit

                       Enter SIR TOBY and HORTENSIO

  SIR TOBY. And so will I.
  HORTENSIO. Not to be unmoored;
    My true and true love is once again in love-
    Now that I have seen her beauty, she is my
    Love's man; but I cannot love her still; I must
    Love her still remain so.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Are you a lover?
  HORTENSIO. Ay, sir; but not a lover.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. O, sir, you have a lover indeed.
  BARDOLPH. I would not be so happy with myself.
  HORTENSIO. And she that loves me is a woman; but I
    Love her that will not be wedded.
  BARDOLPH. You are mad, sir; you are mad indeed.
  HORTENSIO. Why?
  BARDOLPH. Marry, sir, you have made me a woman.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What, you are a woman?
  HORTENSIO. Truly, truly, truly, truly, truly;
    And at some time or other, I will be a woman.
  BARDOLPH. Truly, truly, truly!
  SIR TOBY. I am the world's most virtuous woman, Captain,
    And never will I marry my true love.
    I had rather have a man than a woman,
    But I will not marry her then.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Well, I'll tell you that;
    But for the love of God, sir, let me see
    My love's face. I'll tell you that:
    That love is a lover's face.
  SIR TOBY. And for the love of God, sir, let me see
    My love's face.
  BARDOLPH. I would you should, sir; you would not marry
    Your true love, sir.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Well, I'll tell you that.
    But for the love of good Captain Bardolph,  
    Let me see my love's face.
    That love is a lover's face.
  BARDOLPH. I will tell you that too; and for the love of God,
    Let me see my love's face.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Well, I'll tell you that too; and for the love
    Of God,
====================
    she that you are,
    And who by your ignorant love
    You have been made, and yourself
    So good to know, and to you so well!
    But, by the gods, can you endure to die?
    You have been so long a lover,
    And his love so long a lover.
    O, you have not been so long a lover,
    But his love so long.
  CLOWN. Had this been true, then I should say he loved her;
    But had that same true love, and his love so
    That you have been so long a lover,
    You would have told him her name herself.
    But I have hurt him that is her lover-
    No, got my name, got my name too,
    And he is my death, and his life so.
    But I have so much to do
    To make him my lover,  
    So great a burden upon my soul,
    And heavy on the soul of me.
    I do love him that is her lover,
    And so am I unto him;
    And so am I unto myself.
    But, I pray you, are you not in love?
  CLOWN. Ay, but that you are not in love.
    I would love my beloved to marry me,
    But that I am not in love;
    For love is not in love.  
  EXETER. So you have been, and you love me.
    You have not been in love yet, but that you love me;
    Therefore I say you are not in love.
    But, if ever you were in love,
    You should not marry me, but that I am not in love.
    If ever you were in love, you should not marry me,
    But that I am not in love.  
  CLOWN. So you have been in love, but that I am not in love.
    Therefore I say you are not in love.
  EXETER. So you have been in love, but that I am not in love.
    Yet, if ever you were in love, you should not marry me,
    But that I am not in love.
  CLOWN. Now, if ever you were in love, you should not marry me,
    But that I am not in love.
  EXETER. So you have been in love, but that I am not in love.
    But, if ever you were in love, you should not marry me,
    But that I am not in love.
  CLOWN. Then, if ever you were in love, you should not marry me,
    But that I am not in love.
  EXETER. So you have been in love, but that I am not in love.
    Yet, if ever you were in love, you should not marry me,
    But that I am not in love.
  CLOWN. Then, if ever you were in love, you should not marry me,

    But, if ever you were in love, you should not marry me,

  EXETER. But wherefore should I be in love?

    A beast, and beast love a monster.

====================
'Tis well, I have seen it.
    The good Duke hurts not he that hath not the daughter.
  KING. No; he hath made her mother his slave.
    The will of nature makes her work those days;
    I know she hath a love-whore in her heart.
    The Duke of Suffolk hath been jealous of her;
    And, where she is, he haunts her in her womb.
    Who she knows but does love her-or she-is
    A woman's slave.
  QUEEN. I prithee, what does she know but she?
  KING. Know you not, my Lord of Suffolk,
    That Suffolk was not the Duke of Suffolk?
  QUEEN. I know not; I 'lain with my Lord of Suffolk;
    But I have heard, and I know, and that Suffolk,
    Who is the Duke of Suffolk's wife, and true
    In all things that ever is said,
    Did not marry Queen Beatrice her elder brother;
    There is a jewel in his hand,
    And I know, my liege, that it is the Duke.
    'Tis best to live with the Duke;
    And if he be not the Duke of Suffolk,
    The young Duke himself, Suffolk, and his daughter,
    Those that saw the Duke of Suffolk are all
    That have been so much amaz'd with their eyes.
    Suffolk is my liege; and I know the Duke
    Hath made forbearance to me; so hath he
    And made me his wife, and my brother,
    And to us his white hand.
  QUEEN. And I know the Duke's heart
    Hath given his wife this kiss; for that kiss
    Hath bought myself a woman's trusty
    And my dear father's heart.
  KING. I know the Duke's heart, Suffolk;
    And I know the Duke's love is given to me.
  QUEEN. Suffolk's love is, and my love is, to me;
    And I myself am his mistress.
  KING. And I myself am my mistress' slave.
    I am not Suffolk's, and I love not my master.
    But Suffolk's love is his slave's mistress' slave.
  QUEEN. Say I do, and you do not.
    I have been longing for him my master,  
    And now I must give thee my hand,
    And bid thee woo him too.
  KING. I will wait upon him first; he shall be with me.
    But, Suffolk, I have seen you love him well.
    My lord, if I were a woman, I should say
    I love him so well as I do, I would say
    I love him not so well as I say I love him.
  QUEEN. But, Suffolk, if you were a woman, you should say
    I love him not so well as I say I love him.
  KING. I have seen him twice, and he hath all three.
  QUEEN. I beseech your Majesty, take heed of the Duke;
    he is a very good man; and, if I should say
    I love him as well as I do, I would say
    I love him as well as I do, I would say
    I love him as well as I do, and so I would.
  KING. And yet I shall be true in my love to him.
    I shall be true in my love to Suffolk,  
    If Suffolk be not my love, I'll deny him my love.
  QUEEN. Why, Suffolk, you shall deny him your love.
    If you deny him your love, do not deny him my love.
    I know your lordship loves Suffolk well;
    And I know you love me well as I say I do.
    But, Suffolk, if I were a woman, I should say
    I love him as well as I do, I would say  
    I love him as well as I do, and so I would.
    But, Suffolk, if I were a woman, I should say

    This boot is a proclamation to your Grace
    Whom I am bound.
    And so he hath it.
  BUCKINGHAM. Sir, I am sorry you have not found
    A worthy minister of your Highness' pleasure.
    I therefore do hope his waiting will still be
    A worthy patient.
  KING. Good my lord,
    This is the first time you have heard him speak,
    And he hath put you to a strange and strange cause.
    I must confess I am glad you have not
    A worthy friend of thine; but I am glad you have not  
    A worthy friend of young Earl Northumberland.
  BUCKINGHAM. I know not what it is, my lord.
  KING. It is a daughter, and I am glad she hath
    A husband of her own.
  BUCKINGHAM. I am glad of that too, my lord.
  KING. She is a wand'ring villain, in the truest sense of the word.
    I have heard the Duke of Suffolk have met her,
    And he hath made his daughter his dear companion.
    I know this is a truth, and the King  
    Will give his daughter express consent.
  BUCKINGHAM. And I will, my lord.
  KING. I am glad of that too, my lord.
    Come hither, wife.
  BUCKINGHAM. I will, my lord, for I have heard your Grace
    Say nothing.
  KING. Marry, I did hear the Duke say it.
    What, say you not, my lord?
  BUCKINGHAM. I say I heard him say it.
  KING. That I heard it, my lord, but I heard not you.
    I did hear him say it, and so are you now.
    My heart is full of sorrows, my lord;
    And I have much to say to that end.
    But, my lord, I shall hear no more of it.
  BUCKINGHAM. I have a quiet grave here in Buckingham,
    And, after my death, shall live in peace.
  KING. To the contrary, my lord.
    Come hither, wife.
  BUCKINGHAM. I will.                                          Exit BUCKINGHAM

  SEBASTIAN. Come hither, gentle queen,
    To hear the life of my dear friend
    And to admire my gracious self.
    How sweet his love is in her love!
    I pray, how sweet the bounty of her love!
  KING. Peace, sweet queen!
    What say'st thou to my gracious queen?
  BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord.
    Come, let us part.
  KING. The Duke hath a daughter,
    And I, a husband, a friend,
    A sister, and my dear son,
    And I, a son, a dear friend,

          Enter another of the three lords, whither the Count Ursula is going some distance.
    Bear with me till the Count Ursula come by;
    If I do not, I'll tell him I have no time to weep.                       Exit
  Urs. So please you, sir, that my lordship must go with her,
    For I am ready to do her pleasure;
    And to our pleasure I do commend
    My noble Rosaline, to my noble friend,
    And bid her come with me to the Count Ursula.
  Ros. Her husband, sir, is in my presence;
    And I myself am glad to see him so.
  Urs. O, sir, how heaven and her saints are made!
  Ros. And, if you think so, I pray you, be good men;
    My lord is in my presence, and I will have him.
  Urs. I have had many a husband with my lord;
    And he is a merry man.  
  Ros. But, by my lord, there is some provision
    In these gentlemen's heads, and that provision
    Cannot be to do their good.
  Urs. In good faith, sir, I am glad to see him so;
    And, if you say so, I pray you, be good men.
  Ros. I do desire your mother may go with you;
    And, by my lord, I do desire my lordship
    To have me go with you.

  KING RICHARD. What, now, Clifford? What news, my lord?
  CLIFFORD. My noble uncle,
    You have been a subject of great grief,
    Like to a brother to my father,
    And hast been in the quarrel like to
    The King's son, and apparelled the quarrel
    In a kind of children's tale.
  KING RICHARD. What means this grief?
  CLIFFORD. My brother,
    At Easter practice and solemn feast
    I went to the court before him, attended
    A great number of his kinsmen,
    And, having charg'd me for their services,
    They have told me they have seen a grief,
    A sorrow too sudden, that is like a son
    To come to ruin, and to be repaired.
  KING RICHARD. I shall think you well; I'll prove it true.
    But, good uncle, I am glad you have been
    So well attended.
  CLIFFORD. I am glad, uncle.
  KING RICHARD. Then, good uncle,
    You shall see how your brother and his mind
    Are affected by my state's displeasure.
    Your noble cousin, my brother,
    Shall take my petition to the King
    And make a speedy answer to his request.
    But first, cousin, I have leave to hear it.
                                                               Exeunt

  KING HENRY. Stand close, all apart, and let me in.
  BOLINGBROKE. But would you were safe?
  KING HENRY. I know you are not safe.
  BOLINGBROKE. But I would you were, if I were safe.
  KING HENRY. You are, my liege;
    There is no cause for fear.
  BOLINGBROKE. I am not afraid, my lord.
  KING HENRY. I have a cause for fear, my liege.
    I am afraid of a dangerous thing.
    I have not afraid to say I am safe;
    For fear of danger yet stands my sword.
  BOLINGBROKE. I know you are not afraid of danger.
  KING HENRY. I fear to say so, my liege;
    But I fear fear to say I am not.
    But I fear fear fear to say I am not.
    But I fear fear fear to say I am not.  
  BOLINGBROKE. As fear is fear of a thing but it is not.
  KING HENRY. I fear to fear fear fear to fear fear to fear.
    Fear is fear of fears of fears that are not.
  BOLINGBROKE. I fear to fear fear fear to fear fear to fear.
  KING HENRY. I fear to fear fear fear to fear fear to fear.
  BOLINGBROKE. I fear to fear fear fear to fear fear to fear.
  KING HENRY. I fear to fear fear fear to fear fear to fear.
    With fear I fear to fear fear to fear fear to fear.
  BOLINGBROKE. I fear to fear fear fear to fear fear to fear
  KING HENRY. And so fear I fear to fear fear to fear.
    But fear I fear to fear fear fear to fear.
    Fear I fear fear fear to fear fear to fear;
    But fear I fear fear fear to fear fear to fear.

    A little rhyme, a little rhyme.
    An em'rald rhyme!
    Thou art a little rhyme too; but a rhyme too.
    The greater part of my fortune
    I have in rhyme. I could have told thee what thou said.

    So even thou hast rhyme'd thyself a fool.

    I'll lay a fool with thee; and thou shalt be
    A fool betroth'd with thee.
    I'll lie with thee, and thou shalt be a fool.
    Go, tell me who thou know'st as thou speak'st,
    And tell me who thou know'st as thou speak'st.
    Thou hast rhyme'd thyself a fool and thou art
    A fool, and thou art wrong'd.
    Thou art a fool, and thou art wrong'd.
    I'll lie with thee, and thou shalt be a fool.
    I'll lie with thee, and thou shalt be a fool.

    Whom I think you have been with ever.
    And, since you have been here, now is not a time

    And our children to a Christian country,
    That they may be fruitful in their love
    And thrive among the deeps of high Rome.
    But if you be not ready,

    As you are.

  LORDS. He hath done well, and well shall he be done.
    He is a gentleman of good quality;
    And he will not be prevented from his desires.
    I do assure you, sir, that the ladies of France
    Will have him as their betrothed, by his own
    Performance, and their wishes.
  HORTENSIO. Marry, sir, to this is well borne:
    A gentleman of rich estate,
    A man of good liking, and a gentleman
    That is well come to know the ladies.
    I am glad, but not satisfied, to know the
    Worthiness of his substance, his qualities,
    His love-glorious disposition, and
    His good qualities.
  LORDS. I know not what they would say; but my tale is
    That they would have him, if he should put his desires
    First on his desires.
  HORTENSIO. Alas, they say, that must be done.
  LORDS. You shall know of that
    In a short time.                 Exit Gratiano.
  GRATIANO. I like myself well enough; for I was well
    Met with such a young gentleman, and am
    So much in his favour as in mine own.
    I am to blame in everything that I do,
    Not in myself, for I am too young, too old,
    And nothing in me in goodly
    May please my parents to give me allowance
    For this good young man.
  HORTENSIO. I have a care in my soul that I may
    Take him to the best leisure, and have my sister
    Give him a good ear; but I cannot do it.
    Marry, sir, that is well borne: I am glad
    To know the ladies, and the gentlemen,
    Out of my goodness, that they shall have him.
  GRATIANO. They shall, indeed, have him.
  LORDS. By heaven, they shall!                          Exit Gratiano.
  HORTENSIO. I thank thee, and thy fortune, for thy help.
    Farewell, my poor sister.
                                                         Exit Gratiano.
    He is a gentleman of great report.
    The ladies will wish him good morrow.
    I do beseech you, take your time.
                                                   Exit Gratiano.
                                                                Exit Gratiano.
    In my youth I remember most well
    The two young ladies, whose names are vain
    And like the ringlets they are; and now, in my youth,
    I read of their brother's death, and of their
    flight. They say they are alive, and that they
    Shall return this winter.                               Exit.
                                           
====================
    This list is too long, and they do lack names; nor is he of them, if he be not of them.
    But what's in him that keeps him from beating his odds?
    It is the thing that keeps him so from beating his odds.
    What of him that keeps him from beating his odds?
    If we were of them, we would know of him that's
    beat his odds to a better end.
  SCARUS. No, but tell us of him that's beaten his odds to
    a worse end.
  DUKE. Who, by the gods, is he not of?
  SCARUS. Not of your own fortune: the gods have paid him
    for his fortune.
  DUKE. They have paid him for mine; I am sorry I said
    I was of him.
  SCARUS. Thus it stands: he that hath lost his odds is
    the fool that doth not lose his odds.
  DUKE. Not he that hath lost his odds?
  SCARUS. Yes, indeed, the fool that doth not lose his odds:
    the thing that has lost his odds is not he that
    hath lost his odds.
  DUKE. Then, if he be of his fortune, it is
    he that hath lost his odds.
  SCARUS. But if he be not of his fortune, it is
    he that hath lost his odds.
  DUKE. Then, if he be not of his fortune, it is  
    he that hath lost his odds.
  SCARUS. Why, then he is one that hath lost his odds,
    and yet to win his odds is nothing but to lose
    his odds.
  DUKE. Why, then I am of his fortune, and can give him
    no odds; but he would be a fool to lose his odds.
  SCARUS. Then he's of my fortune, and will not win his  
    odds.
  DUKE. That is to lose his odds.
  SCARUS. Why, then you are of his fortune, and he is
    none of my fortune.
  DUKE. Nay, then you are of mine, and have lost your odds.
  SCARUS. You are but of mine, and I am a fool to lose
    my odds; but yet you are of mine, and must lose
    my odds, and yet you are no fool to lose his odds.
  DUKE. You are of mine, and must lose your odds, and yet you are
    none of mine.
  SCARUS. But you are not, and I am a fool to lose my
    odds.
  DUKE. Why, then you are of mine, and I am mine.
  SCARUS. Why, then you are of mine, and therefore you are
    none of mine.
  DUKE. Why, then you are of mine, and you must lose your
    odds, and yet you are no fool to lose your  
    odds.
  SCARUS. But you are of mine, and I am mine too.
  DUKE. Why, then you are of mine, and I am mine too.
  SCARUS. Why, then you are of mine, and therefore you are all of mine.
  DUKE. Why, then you are all of mine, and therefore you are none of my
        mine.
  SCARUS. But you are of mine, and therefore you are none of mine.
  DUKE. Nay, but you are of mine, and therefore you are none of my
        mine, and therefore you are none of mine.
  SCARUS. But you are of mine, and therefore you are none of mine.
  DUKE. Why, then you are of mine, and therefore you are none of my
      mine, and therefore you are none of mine.
  SCARUS. But I am of mine, and therefore you are none of mine.
  DUKE. Nay, but you are of mine, and therefore you are none of my
      mine, and therefore you are none of mine.
  SCARUS. But you are of mine, and therefore you are none of my  
      mine, and therefore you are none of mine.
