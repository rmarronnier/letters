And I'mma hold on long enough
I'm bout to turn this thing into a track
I'll show you what love is like
Just one more time
And come back again
And save the day
And bounce even more than usual
Just like my mom did when she tried to hold me down
Be proud to say I blew up when I told her
'Cause I helped pave the way for people who don't know me
To see that I'm still the same guy
But I'm changing my mind up 'cause
Sometimes I just feel like I'm stuck in my ass,
How am I gonna get over this hump?
Can't I just get over this hump?
Just hit me back, sit back, write this bitch
Writing this letter, I'm at a loss for words
Damn, I'm on so many's
Just the concept is too cool
I'm so lost without 'em
Em
What is love?
Love is a virus
You bite it and live with it
It's your life
You can live without it
But you'll never live up to it
So you better wake the birds
And lay down the eggs
While I'm still breathing so I can lay the eggs
So quit playing with the honey
I'm done with this game
I'm done with this bitch
I swear I love this game
I never stopped playing
I'm still here
I'm free
All I need is the beat to rap
I keep makin' these little kids mad
And I'm mad enough to lay bricks
With neighbors and law enforcement
I'm mad enough to throw fits
Getting older and older
More and more black
And it gets worse from here
Haskell's on my plate
Is there anyone that I can talk to
Gets like Raymond James
Does he spit? No, he just
Has straight blood? No, he just
Shoots himself in the fucking face with a rifle
(HE'S EMINEM!!!!!) It's Mr. Big
That pissed off in his late fags, didn't he
That somebody fixated on the little kid
That I barely scratched the surface
That got swallowed whole
I'm sick of all this self loathing I get
From all these different angles
Can't change the fact that I'm a
Face full of red balls
And this is the only clear mirror
Of my true self
But I'm self hating
Cause I'm hating
I can't eat, sleep or call
And my medication is making me doubt my own strength
And my strength
And my medication
Cough up a lungful every time I take a pill
But this time, I'm just dispensing enough
Yeah, Mr. Big
Take my hand, and go take this Cheech
Take my hand, and go take this Cheech
(Obie Trice take my hand)Yo
This one's for you and me
And if you don't like it, you can't go out
You can go in your own skin
And be yourself
You can go Cheech
You can get in here
I'm just trying to encourage you
To go out there and show them that you love them little niggas
And if you don't like it, you can't go out
You can go in your own skin
And be yourself
[Lloyd banks]
I got a new fag album coming
I'm married to this bitch
I pay her a visit
Lookin' over every baby's show
Stole the mic from her
Carried her whole ass
Knocked her down
Beat the shit out 'em
Beat the fuck out of 'em
[Eminem]
You want lyrics to be free?
Yea
You can hook up with rappers that take lyrics
Long as you're white
Hook up in a
White whorehouse
With all the drama
Christmas wreck
Between the twins
Living in a trailer
And my fuckin' homie is jealous
But y'all better hate me
Or find me a whore
And flaunt my wealth
You better come to my trailer
And let me suck your dick with one hand and
Paint your other with the wordless word
You better come to my trailer
And let me suck your dick with one hand
And shit your wank ass
[Proof]
Few are as sick as Weisman's,
who supply the HIV
Patients come from all over the world
Sworn to come here sick and heavy
Though I'm in the RV park, the sick ain't
Coming from my country
Or come straight from giving a fuck
Give a fuck what you think
Or make it rain or shineGive a fuck what you wish you had
Come back when you're sick and you need it
When your been in the lab so sick,
Here's
====================
My momma's coochie,
She used to tell me the line was long enough to bust my head in half
And then she would go to the mall and pick up the branch and spray
it on the way home, a ho tied it with rope and tape
And a mean wiener t-shirt with a cross stitching on it
Wife beaters and a hundred and ten decals
My little sister used to make hoopla in the bleachers,
By pouring hot glue through her eyes
To put out the candles and make the night come to life
My brother would watch and would try to get his tuna ole sauce
Until his titties started turning and he started turning
Walking barefoot and barefoot spittin'
And knees started bent and knees were bent
I think my momma got her wish when
I went to get it, I think I got it
I don't think my momma got to hear me
Sayin' her word 'cause my brother's mad
I think my momma got it too
At the time my brother was only in fifth grade
My mother was screaming "Get him off of this'
I don't understand what her doing
Why can't I please my Lord be merciful and forgive my father
'Cause this is my fault
I don't understand why she's mad
I don't know why she's so mean
I gotta take it 'cause I'm not trying to be merciful
I'm tryin' to understand
What my momma's tryin' to say
'Cause I know that I won't be able to pull it
It's like she's super lazy see
All these other rappers gettin' laid I don't see how this
Can't be good, it must be bad
Can't be that bad
Hook:
My momma's tryin' to get rid of me (uh-uh)
She's anti-Tip her damn, she's anti-Tip
My father's a big fan of y'all, uh-uh
And I don't think her just means 'em little good jokes
Don't think she's tryin' to grandstand
Oh yeah she's really got some nice things to say
She's got a new album out, and I hope it's not a Jay-Z-centered
Rappers who just can't keep it super-smooth
Like Makaveli, keep it real, yeah
and Ja Rule too, he knows what she mean
She's one of them big cats, she rules like a champ
And I hope that she keeps tryin' to rap for me
It's super confusing, I'm crazy with this
I've been tryin' to get my shit, done and shit
evened out, and it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
I've been tryin' to get my shit, finished
evened out, and it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
I've been sick of being broke, I've been sick of being broke
I've been told every time I go to rap, I'm signin'
And that's when you can't sign me, when you feel like you got a problem
And you feel like you gotta, uh, make a change and maybe
You don't like it, but you can still sign me
And I appreciate every minute, because I appreciate every minute
It's been a ride, ain't it? I've been paid, I've been paid
I been told every time I go to rap, I'm signin'
And I feel like I'm goin' psychotic
I've been sick of being broke, I've been sick of being broke
I've been told every time I go to rap, I'm signin'
I'm an asshole, bitch, I'm signin' Jay-Z
Fuck my flow, fuck my shit, I'm sick of all this
Homie, this is the only shit that I'm dissin'
And I'm coming to get my dick sucked out
By a dick sucker, cock! Fuck you!
P-p-p-piston monologue, phat preview
Probably say the f-cking one from Fifty years ago
When I first started this shit
Wouldnt it be great if you gave
You the finger, I wouldattach it, so you know
Who's the one you want to lose
Pedal to the metal, patient torture
A painful reminder of where I'm at
Practicing as a pro, I hope you don't question
My hand is in the deck, pat on the back
Here I go again, it's past you all
Shady aftermath, aftermath, aftermath
It's nothing, it's not happening
It's too late for the other side
They're in the car, quick as I get to the gas
====================
It's like a nightmare, it's comical
But the things I dream about, is,
Rhyming in my drink, I drip in my medicine cup
But you won't make sense to me
Unless you're Hannibal
The twisted side of me Hannibal
Hannibal was always going Hannibal
And you couldn't see the twisted side of me
I always felt bad for Hannibal
He was always going Hannibal
I had this bad boy look inside my dreams
And I knew it was going to be rough
And I knew I had a bad boy look inside my dreams
But it wasn't going to be easy
I had to deal with this bad boy inside
And that's when my bad boy look in my dreams
It was like a nightmare, it's comical
But the things I dream about, is,
Rhyming in my drink, I drip in my drink
But you won't make sense to me
Unless you're Hannibal
The twisted side of me Hannibal
I had this bad boy look inside my dreams
And I knew it was going to be rough
And I knew I had a bad boy look inside my dreams
But it wasn't going to be easy

And that's when my bad boy look in my dreams
It was like a nightmare, it's comical
But the things I dream about, is,
Rhyming in my drink, I drip in my drinkI ain't gonna lie, I'm just so fucking excited to get this done.

Thanks for stopping by
I love it
Y'all like my music
It helps when I hear my songs
I get to hang with the best
People from out south
Coming together to celebrate our 50th anniversary
Yeah, it's a pleasure
Straight out the gate we're goin'
It's been one hell of a ride
Yeah, haha

Cause, I want to see if you can swallow a fucking mouthful
Cause I want to see if you can spit a fucking word
Cause I want to see if you can suck a fucking nipple
Cause I want to see if you can swallow a fucking mouthful
I'm not a doctor, I'm a fucking statistician
A fucking statistician, yeah, I'm biased
A little bit, I think I'll spit a fucking word out this coin
And put it in your bank account
And have you sitting by the time you see?
I'm curious, are you paid
And given the time you must be spending
Inhumane, inhumane, inhumane
Inhumane, inhumane
I see you taking pictures of me
Sitting by the blood, watching the streets
Just as a policeman waits for you
Ain't no one here to see that I'm happy
They call me Viceroyal, I'm a soldier too
A soldier, because I'm a soldier, it's time for me
To serve, not follow, rules of the trade
I think I understand the mentality here
Ain't no one here to see that I'm happy
They call me Viceroyal, I'm a soldier too
A soldier, because I'm a soldier, it's time for me
To serve, not follow, rules of the trade
I think I understand the mentality here
Now, I'm not going to pretend to know you
You don't see me as much as you think I do
But I do know that I love you
And I think we have a pretty good bond
I think you probably think I'm trying to hold you against me
Well, that's nonsense of course
First off we don't know each other's name
You know what I do when I do
I just do
I do it
It's not a contest
It's a living, breathing thing
If you respond or not
I'm just happy to be outed as the one who murdered your mother
And put you in the position to see
What it's like to be white at the dedication
And it's like being White Jack, Kenny
While I blaze a cigarette at the bar
I think I'm smoking a lighter
than Peablo Scevi when he injects you
With the syringes that make up the plaque
That the bastard was 'bout to grace the bill
It's a game that I play
I think I'll put on for sure
Shit, is him all doomed
He's still trying to get over to me
So be proud, be proud
He's grown, grown
Laughing, laughing, laughing
I think he's quite aware that we're human
He's grown, grown, grown
He's an animal, growin' a dick
He's frightened of me, he's grown, grown, grew
He's frightened of me, he's grown, grown, grew
Fuck it, he's coming to see me dog
I'll show you fuck the world
I'll shove you a horse through your shins
And shove you right through to the wind
So be proud, be proud
He's grown, grown, grown
Laughing, laughing, laughing
I think he's quite aware that we're human
He's grown, grown, grown
He's an animal, growin' a dick
He's frightened of me, he's grown, grown, grew
He's afraid of me, he's grown, grown, grew
Oh shit, he's growin', he's grown
Oh shit, he's coming to see me dog
I'll show you fuck the world

Up in this raw state, a sinner's sanctum, always on the hunt for a way out, but never out
But out, I don't turned back no more, and that s***, I'm out
So every last word that I have, I have been replaced with this blacker and this white ain't rhyming
But these last few words, have made me scream
And I'll never forget them
I'm going to walk through that wall, never leaving the mural
And I'm not going to leave to the fact that I love my hood
Cause when I'm passed out on the first trimester ultrasound
I'm going to inject this drug, and this is what the scare looks like
'Cause these last few words, have made me scream

The buzz is tremendous now that Andre has entered the game
I'm in the booth conversing with Andre
Conversation is everything
Andre is on the mic
Andre is talking all the time
I just keep hearing the same things
My head is fogging up
My confidence is up
My days of being on the underdog has been wiped

I'm finally able to step up to the front
And talk to these fantastic people
From Andre and Andre's to Andre's
And Andre's name is on the wall
With a baseball inlay
And Andre's hat's on the floor

No, not again
Just because
Oh, I'm so sorry mommy
I just think I'm over exaggerating

====================
It's like a nightmare, it's comin' to you
You screamin' and screamin' and oh
I don't wanna go another round, I'm ill
So on the radio every night when Dre's comin
And y'all mothafuckers say, "Oh, it's Dre!"
Well, you ain't dope, you ain't kush
You kurt spurt or spurt your feet
It's Dre!
So, how do I find him?
I started on the radio, I sold out tour
Then the tour ended and I was gone
I couldn't sell a single album when JÃ¤ger died
¢¤iÃ¤ngers I got to wait
And pray every single night when Dre's comin
And y'all mothafuckers say, "Oh, it's Dre!"
Well, you ain't dope, you ain't kush
You kurt spurt or spurt your feet
It's Dre!

I couldn't sell a CD when JÃ¤ger died
It was too late to start over
So, how do I find him?

Yo, I'm so excited, I feel like I'm going insane
I can't believe it, I just got signed to E! and I'm Raekwon
All I'm feeling is tremendous energy
All I want to do is relax and unwind
I'm so excited, I feel like I'm going insane
I can't wait to throw this party and have it
over and forget
What happened on the way back
Me and Dre were running errands in the area
Could have stopped at a sign
But instead we went over the edge
Started flipping burgers and veg out the back
Went from Long Beach to the Red & Gold
Didn't know it was SoHo

But Dre was gone
I almost passed out
I was dancing with friends
Fondly embraced
But then I realized
I was crazy
Guess it was just the two of us
But guess who's back
 (Kuniva)
Oh (Interlude)
I feel like, stumped
Started goosing
Searching
====================
I don't know why they do this
I don't know how they do it
I don't know if it's psychological or spiritual
It's like they just don't understand the fact
That they can't escape their own roof
It's like they got a plan B
And it's just not happening
[Chorus]

Yo,
I'm going to kill this bitch with a scalpel
I'm ready for combat
I'm like Master P, I'm a Man with Two Fingers
I Shot Jessica Alba, so what?
Ready to shoot at somebody, armed with a pencil
Who's got a Mac-10s? It's like shooting a nuclear missile launch
From an altitude of six feet below
You can reach them, reach them,
And I ain't going to let you down
I'm a man of my word, so you can expect a rude awakening
When I talk, I'm a man of my word
'Cause when I speak
I'm a man of my word
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm going to kill this bitch with a scalpel
I'm ready for combat
I'm like Master P, I'm a Man with Two Fingers
I Holla'ed Jessica Alba, hopped on a dick and a tube of lube
Went in and out of town
Wasn't doing my body like a circus animal
It was bound to get me in a fight
Probably wouldn't anyway
Been real enough to cause Sarah Palin an abortion
Why am I such a sick pig
Am I attracted to the strangulation of Monica
Baby girl, you're such a dick
I put a scalpel in Christina's mouth
Knock her down, punch her in the stomach
And push her until she knocked herself unconscious
(I'm going to kill you)
I'm a man of my word, so you can expect a rude awakening
When I talk, I'm a man of my word
'Cause when I talk
I'm a man of my word
(Speaking in a low voice)
I'm a dude, so you can expect a rude awakening
When I talk, I'm a man of my word
(Speaking in a low voice)

I'm comin' back, with a vengeance, with a brand new album
I rewind every time I write so you can see why I'm poppin'
And rap lyrics I'm reppin'
My motor city is no good,
I'm sick of all this beefin' and I'm comin' back
With a vengeance, with a brand new album
I rewind every time I I write so you can see why I'm poppin'
And rap lyrics I'm reppin'
It's your mother fucking life that you fucking hate
That's why I'm sick of all you
And I got a new nigga for you to hate
That's right, B.I.G. G-I-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-NIGG!
And I got you feelin' a lot of self-hatred
From the first you bit,
Then I let you try everything
Everything was just counting
Then it got to the last minute
I think I just...I don't know
I just feel like I'm surrounded by so much hatred
I just can't breathe!
And it's getting late
So I'm always late
I guess this will just make me feel

I'm on the clock
Rising up from the ashes
I'm a clock ticking
It's 2 am, I'm in the middle of speaking
I want to talk
Excuse the music
Time to introduce you
To the face of the business
I wanna start with you
You're the wrong type of...
I wanna start with you
You're the wrong type of...
To start with
I'm coming to kill you
For you
And for you
And for you
And...and for you
I'm coming at you with a vengeance
No words at first, just a stare that says
No count, no words at first
Just a stare that says
No count, no words at first
I'm coming at you with a vengeance
No words at first, just a stare that says
No count, no words at first
Just a stare that says
No count, no words at first

Song: I love you
Verse:
I just come to kick your ass at your own game
And to wake your competitor up
Jumped out to dinner with files
And made the dinner-breakfast sandwich
And center-fasted the challenger for the same reason
I'm coming to kick your ass at your own game
Cause when I think of you
I'mma kick your ass at your own game
[Album]
No pun intended
'Til supper time
When the tension is under control
To kick it back to the ways of me and you
I'mma be intense and deadly with this rap
Before I end up in jail
Can't lock you up, can't keep you
You're in this together
Because you're not gonna fight, then you're gonna
Die, so to speak, when you come to fight me
I came to save these young mothers
From going without without
You coming to see
How these weak and hollowed-out minds
Are
Cause of this music, and our current political climate
It's hard to relax when
You're feeling nostalgic
When you came to this earth
For this game
To be through
It's like a journey
You coming with lyrics
And lyrics to wrap your mind around
And we're gonna make this again
We're gonna make this again
You coming with lyrics
And lyrics to wrap your mind around
And we're gonna make this again
We're gonna make this again
Pickets of yellow fever
Lightning strikes again
I think I'ma lose my keys
Everything I should be up in
I'm like a head trip with the wind
I could be the head of this crew
It's like a twist on a string
I think I'ma lose my keys
Everything I should be up in
I'm like a head trip with the wind
I could be the head of this crew
[Artist name]
I start
====================
You wanna be friends?
You'll never think of us, let alone eat, sleep, or be nude
We're laughing all the time, and we're always smiling
I smile all the time, and I eat, sleep, and be nude
See, things have changed in the game, like they used to when I was the ganja
But I can't change the way I feel about you
I still feel sad that I lost my virginity to you
'Cause while I'm on the subject,
I'm also sorry I didn't tell you
I still feel sad that I didn't
Tell you
I guess it's okay for you
To hate the game
You can hate the sport
You can always go and just
Go and just

Lyrical
I give the world of mine
A little bit of myself
And indulge in some R&B
I write the sort of poetry that gets the crowd pumped
And full of it, pride on you
You're poetry is filled with a
Fill a can, it's empty without it
So bow down, and God is my salvation
From all pain, all hatred, all jealousy
I release from my grip
The shackles I've been dealt, I'ma hold onto this today
Just so I don't repeat them
Motherfuckin' West, fuck the present
Fuck the past, fuck the adolescent
I'ma hold onto this today
Just so I don't repeat them
Motherfuck lil' boys, this is the history
And you better fucking understand
Boy I'm a mean, boy I'mma fuck the mariah
Boy I'm a mean, boy boy boy
I'm a drain boy, boy I'mma fuck the girl

Hilary Duff once said
====================
See what I do in my brain do
Ain't nothing new to me
It's been going on here for a long time
My name is Marshall Mathers
Dre told me to call you, to tell you
What I think of you
What I respect the most Marshall
I guess that if I hear back
I will have no choice but to raise hell
Raising hell I will either
Raise hell or hang up
I'll be praying for answers
I'm locked in a cage
So I'm breathing
No one seems to know it's a cycle
Raising hell I'm holding my nose
I'm going to die raising hell
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my mind
That I'm going insane
I think I'm losing my temper
Holland wont even speak when I slap his dick
Holland wont even take my tongue
And put on my Tasco de Mayo
And wear a Karl Kani
And take a shit on the Pepsi
It's a double victory
And I think my medication is working
I'm finally putting an end to the madness
I think I'm starting to lose my temper
I think my medication is working
I'm finally putting an end to the madness
Raising hell I'm holding my nose
I'm going to die raising hell
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my mind
That I'm going insane
I think I'm losing my patience
I think my meds are taking me way too far
I think I'm going insane
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hell I'm holding my nose
I'm going to die raising hell
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my mind
That I'm going insane
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hell
I think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hell
I think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Yeah, ho
What happened, Marshall?
Ha ha, what happened to be, coming through?
Yeah, came out, came in, new school, h.o.d
Hittin' on the next level, ain't nothing new to me
Hittin' on top, hoe-ha ha, I got a new nigga named B.i.
New school nigga, hoe-ha ha ha, that's great
Nothing new to me, that's what I came up wit, ho
Hittin' on top, came out of nowhere
Bout to rip his own chest like Cheddar Bobs
I don't even know what's new, it's old school, hoe
Raising hell, I think I'm going insane

Inside it, funky as can be
It goes one on one, we bust out of it
We bust out of our pen, scribble in it
It's always going it's we say
When you bust it you can't do
What you doing the beat should be the beat
The beat should be our pen
Pen in our notebook, scribble in
====================
You can't see me
I'm hiding behind the safe
I'm on a quest to make it through school
Without a clue what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing
I just want to shake the whole world
And get to know all the beautiful women who got it goin
I had a dream girl, who I mistook for a friend
Who was always pushin' me to the brink
Even though I was soon to be broke as a child
I remember tryna shake her head in that state
I was goin' through on my way to get through
I'd go in the door and the doorbell ring
But I guess I just ignored it
I was tellin' Hollywood not to push me
And tellin' Hollywood no one
Tellin' Hollywood no one
I was tellin Hollywood not to push me
And tellin' Hollywood no one
I was tellin Hollywood not to push me
And tellin' Hollywood no one
I was tellin Hollywood not to push me
And fuck it I'd rather be goin through
What would you do for a woman who push me
Threw me down a flight of steps
And never shoulda' come to the rescue of me
I remember cryin' at the top of my lungs
Now this is my little miracle,
I'm givin' Amy Winehouse a try,
Can't no longer ignore my look
And it just tears my soul out
Doesn't it?
Oh God no!
Now grab the scissors
Cut the paper and the pencil
And go to the car wash
Cut the baby's neck off, still alive
Trying to drag the dead body out
Some slut so twisted
I'm still tryna cop 'til the pot is boiling
Aiyyo t.i.b.drama, its that junk you goldie
You must be out of your mind
Aggravated rapist
Spent your whole life trying to prove
You aint shit, man you shoulda killed the bitch
You'll never, not even if you wanted to
But you know that the life you turned to a basement diss
Is saucy now you must of had the fun
'Til the chopper slid
I hit the gas
Took the whole house in her (ha ha)
Shit, I wish I was dead
But I just kept goin crazy
I'm a direct result of you hating on me
And by the way
You probably know the story behind it
I spent the winter in the attic
Open flossing away the blood
Went to the bitches, pleading
Please don't let me be me, I need a father
I've been down a road
I'll beat the shit out you in a couple weeks
You probably know the name of my blood
The road that I went, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
That road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm backI guessin' it straight out
I guess I need a lil' break
I'm sort of rolling with the dough (yeah)
I mean, sometimes it's hard to find time for all these crazy shit that's out
Everybody's gettin' to be just a little bit crazier
Catch me if you can, Nick Cannon just passed you in the lobby
Hi, it's me, what? You want some?
I dunno, just a friend of mine
What is he sayin'?
"He's just a friend of mine", from when
====================
Sound like a fight to the top
Shake your head like bear hugs
What you doing to the world? You're f***in' with the world
And I'mma make your life miserable, you're gonna fucking kill yourself
I'm bumping a bitch in the street with a car door hinge
She's pregnant, I don't need no help
I'm chucking at his trachea
She's in the trunk, he's chucking dead hoes
I'm bumpin' him with the trash can
Going, "Here, let me grab this tools, and I'm coming at you from this angle, and you can't duck it, and I can't back it"
I'm punching the air in his face with the bat
He's so mad, he's got his jaw chipped
I'm chasin' his chest with a belt
I'm chasin' his face with a mask
I'm chasin' his chest with a mask
I'm chasin' his face with a mask
Yo, how come you couldn't quit with Shady
You were so eager, you quit, you bled so much that you didn't
You quit, you jumped in front of a gun and let it
walk, now you propped it up so much that it
shouldn't have took you
So, why do I keep giving you reason to wanna kill
Why do I put so much hate in your tweet
And put together just a mere 50
So, get down, you're gonna feel
Like a boss when I slump, I'm a bitch
I'm a. Don't like it? Like I'm great?
Get the hell outta my mind, bitch!
I'm gonna fuck you up! My tea's gone cold I'm wondering
Why am I such a fucking prick?
Why do I act so wimpy?
Why do I act like I'm so cold
I don't understand why I'm so warm
And someone said to me, "Don't act like a fan, you want to get cold-hearted?"
So, I said fuck the person
I hate, I'll kill him like I'm KillasKryptonite
And a therapist told me to shut up, and when I did, it made me ill
And, I hate it
So, I'm poison gas, I'm sick of it
I hate it, it's sick to watch
But, it made me into the guy from the movies
I just hate it 'cause it sucks, yeah, suck, yeah
I'll shit on you, suck, yeah, suck, yeah
Hate it is, hate it is
I'll shit on you, hate it is
I'll spit on you, hate it is
I'll fuck you up if you look at me
If you are a slut, I'm a world of sires
I'll shit on you, shit see, fuck you
I'll shit on you, shit see, fuck you
I'll shit on you, shit see, fuck you
I'll shit on you, shit see, fuck youModels know what it's like to be cut
From the hand of a man who just happens to be your manager
Tell him that your goal is to eat dough
I'll fuck you up tomorrow, boss
What you missin' about junior? Next thing you know, you's married to Rosie
And your baby's grown, right? Misses you will still be missin'

Yayo[Intro]
You wanna start with a blank stare?
Or should I say stare in a blank look
like this (ya see my nigga)
start to think that I might be one of them kids on the
Block (yeah)
who start with blank stare and go through and
make it official I'm the illest nigga to grace the (block)
my peers and I just might get rolled
cause I'm so soft
like cocaine (yay)
and the streets that I might slip and fall
like I might just need a drop of liquor
like ice two pills and a half
a nice day for the fresh start
now GET OFF!
Okay

PJ:
[Chorus: x2]
My mom always told me, "If you really felt like you were going to die..."
I always said, "If you really felt like you were going to die..."
[Proof]
Yo I'm always right here with
the best cause and emotion I can think of
is how my mom felt when my feet were on the ground
and I'm still in touch with my momma through
our family...
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Baby mama said, "I don't want you dying, this is the wrong message to tell you..."
I got her by the hand and she choked
I said, "Ew, she said it was for me, not him..."
I used to tell rappers how they could hurt your mama,
but she don't want to go that route
My mom loved me and my dad hates me
And I know him for many reasons
but she just don't want me to go that route
So before they cut me off at the door
I told 'em, "We want you to know, we love you..."
I told every motherfucking mama in the house
"I don't want you dying, this is the wrong message to tell you..."
I got her by the hand and she choked
I said, "Ew, she said it was for me, not him..."
I used to tell rappers how they could hurt your mama,
but she don't want to go that route
I told 'em, "We want you to know, we love you..."
I told every motherfucking mama in the house
"I don't want you dying, this is the wrong message to tell you..."
I got her by the hand and she choked
I said, "Ew, she said it was for me, not him..."
I used to tell rappers how they could hurt your mama,
but she don't want to go that route
I used to tell 'em, "We want you to know, we love you..."
I used to tell rappers how they could hurt your mama,
but she don't want to go that route
[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
If I had just kept my temper and acted like fuck the world
I might have made the cut
I might have stopped the game
I might have stepped up to the mic and said I'm glad that my flow is spiking
I'm happy that I'm alive
I just might have made the cut
if the stakes were right
I might have let my mothafuckin mouth drop
I don't think she understands that
Mama Mia!
Mr. Porter!
Yes! Yes!
Oh! Stop! He's upstairs!
Mr. Porter!
Mr. Porter!
Mr. Porter!
(both Mr. and Mrs. )
both Mr. and
(wham!)
both
(oh my god!)
(women scream)
I just stopped! Went back to the lab!
She said, "Mr. and Mrs. Porter, your husband's involved in a lot of shit, and I know that your husband's involved in a lot of shit too.
(chorus)
Oh, what the fuck, whoop that ass!
Oh, what the fuck, I don't know!
Oh, what the fuck, I do know this shit!
Oh, what the fuck, I don't know!
Oh, what the fuck, I don't know this shit!
Oh, what the fuck, I don't know this shit!
Oh, what the fuck,
====================
Cause I don't think you understand that..
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
I don't hate you do I?
I just love you
Sometimes I just want you to know that
I'm justma let you go but until then
I'm justma take your place
I guess it's time for you to die
I told you I'm not afraid of this fuckin wastin it
I don't know if this what it feels like
To walk in the store with a gun to my chest
And expect no help
No reason not to shoot
But until then, I'm justma let you die
I told you I'm not afraid of this fuckin wastin it
I don't know if this what it feels like
To walk in the store with a gun to my chest
And expect no helpMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Mister "I'm Not Peeing Around This Thing" You Knew That Thing Was Coming
You Think I was killin' these hoes
Who knows?
Maybe I was just tryna' hide from you
I don't remember tryna' tell you
Sittin' inside your dreams a trippy little girl
With Hello Kitty on its bottom
Trying to, sit up in the
Feeling stupid, tryin' to figure out what the hell is up with this logo
Dear Stan, I didn't, I was tryna, just ducked
And got jumped by all 5 of you
Went to your mother's house
Don't know why, but I guess it's
Your dream dad, did I not,
Or did I have enough doubt
That I could break into your house with a knife and kill you
So I guess it's that time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
Yo, yo
Dear Stan, I didn't, I was just tryna
Fuckin' to,
And got jumped by all 5 of you
Went to your mother's house
Don't know why, but I guess it's
Your dream dad, did I not,
Or did I have enough doubt
That I could break into your house with a knife and kill you
So I guess it's that time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
Dear Stan, I didn't, I was just tryna
Fuckin' to,
And got jumped by all 5 of you
Went to your mother's house
Don't know why, but I guess it's
Your dream dad, did I not,
Or did I have enough doubt
That I could break into your house with a knife and kill you
So I guess it's that time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
Dear Stan, I didn't, I was just tryna
Fuckin' to,
And got jumped by all 5 of you
Went to your mother's house
Don't know why, but I guess it's
Your dream dad, did I not,
Or did I have enough doubt
That I could break into your house with a knife and kill you
So I guess it's that time for you
This is it
I'm done tryna walk out of here now and leave this bitch
No need to go to the hospital
Open the gate for anyone
Enter through the back door
Take a few steps
But don't give way
A couple of people
Could otherwise be heard outside
It could be a car with the windows down
Slipped and ripped like Saint Laurent underwear
Chorus
Oh, I don't know, maybe
I just, forgot
Who am I kidding?
A bunch of little kids?
Yeah, look, there's a fight here
Rappers fight in a sport,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenasAlright, so now you know that I,
====================
'Cause all they do is scream, yell, and fuck us
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
So they're screaming, yell, and fuck us
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
So they're crying, and fuck us
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
So they're screaming, yell, and fuck us
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
So they're screaming, yell, and fuck us
And I'm the reason they can't go to sleep
And I'm the reason they can't wake up
And I'm the reason they can't fight
And I'm the reason they can't breathe
And I'm the reason they can't fight
I'm the reason they can't understand us
They don't understand us, when they saw us
They saw us with their bare hands
They had a vision of a tonight in hell
They saw our bodies lay
Just outside the door of the guest house, and they said, "Oh, it's okay, we gotta go, we can't leave now!"
Kuniva said, "Let's go, we can't go now, we can't
Go, we can't go now, we can't
Go, we can't

This Generation, we're gonna face it now
What do you see the most? Shady
I see the penitent
With bullet wounds all
While I write this, serenity
To think I love this woman more than you
See me write and act like you loathe me
But you're the one that I've been holding dear
Though we grew apart, what's on your mind
Is bringing closure to me
What you don't wanna hear is the chorus
'Cause I'm getting paid for this love
So everything I write is for you
I put it out and only sit through my dinner and cavort
But I don't spare the energy that way
Keep living your life and what you look like the rest of my life
And everytime you look down I'm supposed to be there
The one with the gun
I'm supposed to be the one with the shot
'Cause everything I write is for you
I put it out and only sit through my dinner and cavort
But I don't spare the energy
====================
I'm not a Hollywood type of person, but I get to make a living off them
filmmaking
Clerk
Deputy
Poster child
My life's like a popcorn classic, yeah
There are so many more laughs
I'm thankful for the planet
grrr
I'm a food stamp lotto
My trailer sat next to the linens
Which is to say I could just eat the trailer tomorrow
Which is to say I'd probably die if I ate the pussy today
Which is to say I'd probably die if I ate the pussy today
I'm so horny today, I guess I just hate bitches
Clocks
Pants
Dicks
Hoes
Momma
Yeah
Shorty I love you
Chorus
Oh yeah
I think I just pulled the plug
Yesterday
I was so eager to get back
I overdosed on prescription medication
and just couldn't get it
Plus
I was trying to get my P.T.A.G.T.
To stop the X-Men
Coming through for the first time
Running up in your chopper
Screaming F.B.I.B.
When will it stop?
I think I need some Xanax
and I'm not at all pursuing it
Alot of people are panicking
I think I'm about to choke
I think I might just faint
You're coming with me
and I ain't even back
That's the only shot I got
I was panicking and scrambling
Looking for someone to clutch
and gee, I gotta get that
You're not searching for a spark,
it's just the last shot
I'm just giving you the chance to shine
and all the chances
are gonna be wasted
It's like giving up a friend
All they do is taunt me
And I'm thankful for that
But it's like a cycle that's following me
And they panics and panics
And they panics
I'm like a fish in this sea
and this is the story of me
And this pen, when it comes to pens
I'm so full of myself
I feel like I'm on top of the world
I'm so full of myself
I just let it go
I'm free flowing
I'm not a person who can be locked up
Just because I'm famous
They say I'm a walking disease
But I'm a disease, I'm a disease
So they say I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking
I'm a walking, walking
I'm a walking, walking
I'm a walking, walking
How you gonna treat these pooh-poohing, coo-poohing, coo-poo
Feels like an hour left, on the clock
I'm at work, yeah I'm home, I'm home
I'm a walking disease, I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking (I walk, walk)
Walk in the park, walk in the sunshine
I'm making a new habit
I'm going back to walk the dogs
I'll walk with them, however long that it takes
I'll be living the Walk, my Walk
I'll walk with them, however long that it takes
I'll be living the Walk, my Walk
I'm so full of self-esteem
I feel like I'm walking the entire island
I walked the entire world, in a box
I got my cane and just kept kicking it
Never realized how much of a pain I'd be in
Probably shouldered off the couch
Stood on the other side of the world
Just for to walk a straight line
Felt like I was goin' nowhere
Till I looked around and saw a whole new world
I walked a straight line
Felt like I was going, world wide
Told everyone in the car
I'm sorry I walked straight into it
Maybe if I'd just opened my mouth
I might not have said a word
But I sure am sorry I walked right into it
And I'm so sorry I apologized to my fans
And apologized to Hip Hop when I said I'm a walking disease
And I apologize to the world
So I just know that its sickening when the glass is half gone
And the pain is gone, it's too easy to forget the bigger picture
The bigger the hole, the bigger the hole
Complete lack of self-esteem
Drop the chains, quit admitting you little motherfucker
Is now I got my baby at the altar
====================
I'm a criminal, innocent until proven guilty
Then hang me if you don't want me
I'm a criminal, innocent until proven guilty
Then hang me if you don't want me
I'm a criminal, innocent until convicted
Then hang me if you don't want me
I'm a criminal, innocent until convicted
Then hang me if you don't want me
I'm a criminal, innocent until convicted

I use it like a thousand volts, with no extension cord
Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy
Teenage boys, teenagers spendin' this monstrosity
Still going strong, that's what I'm spendin' money for
I use it like a thousand volts, with no extension cord
Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy
What goes through my mind when I'm swinging this thing?
What goes through my mind when I'm swinging this thing?
This Mona Lisa with her goatee
On the floor of the living room, with its its lights off
It goes a little bit like a little brother, goes under the stairs
Down to the basement, over to the bridge
Down to the bridge
Oh, he's coming too, Molly, I'm crazy
Come on, we're in the club at a brisk pace
I aim to throw you both off the edge so fast
That you might as well fly through the midsection
Oh, he's coming too, Molly, I'm crazy
Come on, we're in the club at a brisk pace
I aim to throw you off the edge so fast
That you might as well fly through the midsection
Oh, he's coming
Soon as the first words come, I'm laying in the mud
Foul floss, I'm campaigning for mayor
Oh, I'm going postal right now, I have no time
For these lame interviews, and these phone interviews
I do this fifteen second guessin', throw you in a deep punch with no room in A-ball
Two letters, and I'm still alive, still laughin'
Even if the grammy I end up with
Probably won't even make sense to you
Hows that's a thousand digits, um, six-eight
Sixteen, seven to go
I'll break your leg, that's a thousand digits
That's a thousand digits
That's a thousand digits
That's a thousand digits
Oh, he's coming too, Molly, I'm crazy
Come on, we're in the club at a brisk pace
I aim to throw you off the edge so fast
That you might as well fly through the midsection
Oh, he's coming too, Molly, I'm crazy
Come on, we're in the club at a brisk pace
I aim to throw you off the edge so fast

Oh, he's coming
Soon as the first words come, I'm laying in the mud

Oh, I'm going postal right now, I have no time
For these lame interviews, and these phone interviews
I do this fifteen second guessin', throw you in a deep punch with no room in A-ball
Two letters, and I'm still alive, still laughin'
Even if the grammy I end up with
Probably won't even make sense to you
Hows that's a thousand digits, um, six-eight
Six wanting to go
I got a thousand and a half, it's a thousand
And I'm aiming for a million
You want to throw me off, talk about a volcano
A volcano in a million years, I'll throw you off the face
And wipe you the floor with a broom
Shit if I don't, then I won't fix this soon
I got a thousand and a half, it's a thousand
And I'm aiming for a million
And I'm aiming for a million
Fuck the world, fuck the Grammy
Fuck the Macmillan, fuck the whole industry if you doubt me
I'm a fagot, believe me homie, I hate awards
I'm so jealous, I wonder how many kids I kill
How many hats I leave on my mom's neck
Slap my dog, bitch I'm a bitch, show me your paper
I'll flip it in my lap, bitch, show you my reel
And you won't flip shit when I flip it in your face
I flip it in your face,fucking hate
[Chorus]
It's ho', it's ho', it's ho', it's
It's been a long time comin' and I'm ho', I'm
Wait a minute I forgot what aUTEAN

You can do it your way
You can do it your way fine fine, fineI told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back
What now nigga what now what
You's the projects nigga
[Chorus]
One shot two shot three shot four shots
All I hear is more and more of what I hear is pop
I think I'm about to lose my mind
All I see is a blur from a distance
When I invert what's going on between us
You see that's why I call it crucible
Cause when the pop hits I think I'm gonna retreat
Cause when the guns are startin' to fire
Me and Dre are like two foxes
Kiss the moon landers and forgot the fact the moon
Would come back on moon landers again
And I think I'm runnin' out of ammo
So yeah I'm gettin' the paper right I ain't shoot at nothing
Rappers are killers just like sheep
And I'd never trade for you
I'd never grab a razor for you
I'd never grab a razor for you
I'd never grab a razor for you
I'd never grab a razor for you[Eminem]
This world is mine
And I'm not looking for nothing in return
None of you fuckin' docs
Come on docs
You know the fuckin' song
Is about to get serious doc
Hey, how you doin'?
You know the fuckin' song
Is about to get serious
Do you want to go or you shut your fucking mouth
You said you aint in the mood to mess around
And that's a choice
Well fuck it, I choice, go play the island
[Obie Trice]
Don't ask me Obie, I'm not with you in the studio
So Gotta listen to me, but you know I quit, I'm just fuckin' with you
This Is Never A Snatch, Me and Obie, We Never Dumped The Pup In The Back Of The Ac
So, Aftermath
So, Aftermath, how come you couldn't find the tear stains
Since when we last played, your vans would come home gasping
And we wouldAutomatically Suck Thy Assholes
Of course we rip every fuckin' magazine out and point it at you
But you ain't nothin' with us, so fuck that shit
We can't fuckin' kill ya
We're killin' killin' killin'

So this is my life, my words comin' from this side
So listen up, you're listenin' to the rules cuz they hate me

I'm in a white in his 20's
Police car in my 40's
I'm walking my a** west
And I could be dangerous, in a blink of an eye, I'm
Ain't no one around, what the fuck you wanna do?
I walk around mad, you can call it seance
Cause I'm a rebel, walking my a** south
And all my people from Mars
All my people from the 50
Cause I'm a pop, I'm a rebel, walking my a** south
And all my people from the 50
Cause I'm a pop, I'm a rebel, walking my a** south
Guess who's back, back, yo, who's back
The 50's return
After 13 years, they still don't let me be solo
I'm still standin' by this,
My people will never see you again
They said if I wasn't so goddamn mad,
Then I'd probably still be outta gas,
Went to church every Sunday,
Went to shave,
Went to read the Bible,
Went to pray every Sunday,
Washed your ass,
Went to take your kids out to the beach,
Went to take you out to dinner,
Went to bathe,
And more,
I'm still mad, but I'm not afraid of danger
Of dying, of dying, of dying, of dying,
Yes, I am, I'm going to die,
I'm going to die, (bye bye)
I'm dying to see you,
(I love you)
I'm dying to see you,

I told this bitch to slow down, slow down
I told this bitch to slow down, slow down
She didn't like the fact I was off the water
I told this bitch stop ducking
I got my knife and she stabbed me in the fuckin neck
So, I'm steaming in the cold water
Let her neckLick, b****, b****, b****
Who the fuck passed you the mic?
I had a little surprise for you both
You missed it, I'm always
====================
Two words: defensive back
Hustle hard, this will take skill
Intellectually speaking, I'm better than them
Brains, I've been training hard to reach,
And this ain't just a drill
This is a defensive back drills
I'm just trying to get my ass off the ground
Two words: defensive back
Hustle hard, this will take skill
Intellectually speaking, I'm better than them
I come with the best defense and try to stay ahead
As long as I can stay ahead,
I'm just trying to catch a buzz and stay fresh
Two words: defensive back
My dick is sore now, I got the funds to buy a prosthetic arm
And I got a tattoo of Darth Vader and Ah, poor soul
I hope they cut my fucking head off, I've been standing there
Still standing there,
Like it's raining and snowing,
Like I'm trying to count down the days until Christmas
Then I hope they catch me on Easter Monday
I'm still standing there,
Walking dead, it's all dead and gone
I guess you could call my murder weapon
But still I try to live a regular life
Assuming they don't cut my fucking pay
It's funny,
Don't you think that we can get along the shootin' you pistol
Don't you think that we can hold you responsible for my fuckin' actions
That were so bad that they deserved to be sued for embezzlement
And that I would score a dollar in lotto,
And that's just for signin' my fucking flyers at the mall
Just to get you all the way there
I'm still standing there,
Walking dead, I got the funds to buy a prosthetic arm
And I got a tattoo of Darth Vader and Ah, poor soul
I hope they cut my fucking head off, I've been standing there
Waiting for them to let me off the hook
So, I'm waiting for them to come around,
And they don't come around until I'm fucked badly
I'm waiting for them to come around,
And they don't come around until I'm fucked so
Much
That I'm wonderin', "Why am I such a fuckin' asshole?"
Am I a fuckin' sinner or a fuckin' asshole?
Am I a fuckin' sinner or a fuckin' asshole?
I'm a fuckin' bitch, if you fucking consider me your fucking bitch
Then fuck me warm, then cold, then warm
Hustle hard, you'll melt any suit you wear
I'm a fucking pimp, and your fucking words are fucking killers
I might leave early, wear 'em later
Stay in bed, cause I'm watching the oscar,
Screaming Fuck Dolly Parton, I'd rather die then you fuckin' wit
Testing liquor, Dolly Parton, I'd rather die than you with
Testing liquor, Dolly Parton, I'd rather die than you wit
Nuts, nuts, faggots see you take it
They say I look like a fuckin' sissy, yeah
I'm known as one of the suckers, yeah
Take your dick out, you little faggot
(Hail Mary please accept this as a warm welcome)

Get rich or get fucked
Ain't no one in it for me
[Eminem]
Is it because you hate it when I talk that you always tell me to cut it off?
I can't tell you what the fuck I was thinking when I
said that, cause there was a lot of shit planted in my head that day
[Proof]
S***, SHUT UP!

Oh, I can hear your heartbeat
It's urgent
I put the phone down, it's urgent
I think I'm passing out
I'm on my way to work
To get a fuckin' diamond
And my fuckin' bestie
Coke, Coke, Vanilla Ice
I'm a cipher
I set the world on fire
Don't point it at anybody
But rather point it at
Em
Cause ain't no one who's as dope as me
Bad as me
Bad as me
Bad as me
Bad as me
You're probably familiar with Obie, the soft-nurse
Who cooks up the cheese and ill-prepared
Who makes the little people eat the sick
And arranges the sick for his grandkids
And ill-fame it's heir, rest of his life
He may not be as bad as you think
But he is me, who's the baddest bitch in the house
Who's always in the sickest and truest
Who picks the kids up in the cribs
And puts the kids in the damn van while the kids are at the play-pen
Cause when he gets to pick up the guitar
His guitars will just keep playing
When will he learn to sustain?
Cause he must buy a goddamn gram
I told you it's bad for your health
I don't like the sound of it
I don't like the shit I hear when I'm hearin' it
Don't like the music
It's like the music's played
All these drugs cause they bad for your health
(Come on)
Gimme the mic, let me hear ya
I'm a walk up in the bar scene
And I ain't playin' no games
No one respect you y'all or anything
I walk up in the room naked in a doghouse
Have you ever seen the half-naked Michael Vick?
Look who's got you goin' crazy
I'm goin' in your hair, fucking your mother
[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear your heartbeat
It's urgent
I put the phone down, it's urgent
I think I'm passing out

Who keeps the kids in the cribs
And puts the kids in the damn van while the kids are at the play-pen
Cause when he gets to pick up the guitar
His guitars will just keep playing
When will he learn to sustain?
Cause he must buy a goddamn gram
Oh boy, I almost forgot
It's urgent
I put the phone down, it's urgent
I think I'm passing out
I'm on my way to work
To get a fuckin' diamond
And my fuckin' bestie
Coke, Coke, Vanilla Ice
I'm a cipher

To get a fuckin' diamond
I'm a secret
A little girl, I love you
I love you
I love you
She's my baby, she loves me
 I love you
I told you I love you
I just put flowers in your coffin
Lay awake in the morning
Couldn't see which of us would
Call her my girlfriend
Just the other night I told her I loved her
I just loved her

I'm eatin shit like it's happening
From the depths of hell I've emerged
And I'm in the streets of disgust
With my jaws down and my teeth up like Triumph,
In the second that I come close enough,
I put my whole neck and whole side of my neck on
Stomping and my whole face and whole side of my neck
Off a ledge like Jell-O, my whole back is on
And I can run circles around you like I'm running from Superman
And so it goes for the heroes of our day,
And for those that are past,
We embrace, with love, the present is the future
And the future is glorious,
And I will always remember those that we beat,
And the ways that we clawed,
And kept kicking ass in the present,
And I'm swingin' my baton on the track,
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,

Is it me or do I look like a banana,
like a bum on a bad day,
our spirits high,
and your breath getting hot,
know that you got egg in your face,
I told em, 'hey look look',
let em get in,
its your fault,
my words gettin' them caps,
you can suck them words,
I'm a slim shady,
straight to bed of the troll,
witchy with a dead katana,
on to bed of the troll.

Bitch, turn the music up

====================
I never loved you
Always kept you in my thoughts
When I had the penicillin to make you cry
I never wanted you to grow up
Never loved you
Never will
But tonight
You're going to the hospital
For the hospital
For the rehab
Yeah, wait
How long will it be before the demon falls?
I don't really know
I just want to make sure you know
I love you girl
I miss you a lot girl
I got a lot of things in common
I'm addicted
To that pill you took
You said you were going to kill me
But you didn't kill me
You just happened to pick up the phone
It went something like this
Jumped out to meet you
And I was like
"Ok let me kiss your cheek then"
"Ok that's what you wanted"
"Ok then what's up with the lip gloss?"
"I don't know"
"Ok let me do that"
"Ok let me do that"
"Ok then what's up with" that and
"Ok that's what's up with with that
You're kissing my ass.
I'm leaning against the wall
"Ok let me hold that phone up"
"Ok let me hold that phone up"
"Ok let me hold that phone up"
"Ok let me hold that phone up"
I never wanted you to grow up
Never loved you
Never will
But tonight, I'm going to the hospital
For the hospital
For the rehab
I don't really want you to grow up
Never loved you
Never will
But tonight, I'm going to the hospital
For the hospital
You know, I'm in this together
I'm in this together
They called me Rosco
I'm in a whole 'nother world
You're in a room full of other Buddays
Together we sing this song of thanks
And when I light the bonfire
All I need is the wind to blow
And all I I I am I flame Buddays together
Just the two of us
We burn lighter than 100 of us
Smoke like 100 kilos of grass
Together we sing this song of thanks
And when I light the bonfire
All I need is the wind to blow
And all I am I flame Buddays together
Just the two of us
We burn lighter than 100 of us
Smoke like 100 kilos of grass
In between us on the freeway in Colorado
I'm so busy
Driving down a mountain pass
I'm not looking back
So why am I such a lonely man
When I think I'm melting away
In a fatal lack of backbone
Someone's knocking on my door
Looking for me like I'm serial killers
Someone that I chase like a serial killer
But they pull the scissors and cut a limb
And slice my heart in half so they can eat Jack Daniels
I'm so busy
I don't even come to meetings
I'm just busy
Just busy making movies
And I'm not going to jail
Feeling so out of control
This world is mine for the taking
World's my jam, world's my dime
And if I'm not the one you want in your life, this world is mine for the taking
So keep working
Keep living your life, and I'm going to make you bleed out
And kill you if you don't let me lead
Keep living your life, and I'm going to make you bleed out
It's been 21 years and 6 months and I don't see no me
This is my life, I'm running around killing maniacs
Yanking motherfuckers' arms out and ducking
Looking like one of them last thing you wanted to do was pull a gun on us
You wanted to flaunt it, we shoved you down a victim's
But you didn't want to admit it
We were coming with guns, you flippin' it
So we walked out and dropped the soap
And wiped our blond hair and laughed
Like the streets we should be ashamed
We ain't been able to stop your assasin from doin'
Now let's go back to the corner
And turn right around
We got a brand new ragtime
This time we won't even call it a loss
Like we lost a ragtime for nothing
Shit, Shady, Shady
I'll never forget
The first time I ever used to snort one
I made a batch and put it in a pipe
And snorted it back and forth until one
Hows me re-enactin' the whole thing again
And got up and down the street in a Ford
Into a ditch, blaring the speakers
When I pulled up
It was clear to me now
That
It's not a sunny day
And the air was so warm

====================

But I think we did a good job
Of keeping the world calm and peaceful
Dre, what'd you do if he was on his knees
And you were with him and he was drunk?
You and your husband could get serious if you got along
But I think what impressed you the most was the fact that
That I could trust you
And you were able to come up with some shitless shit
That didn't involve me
And you could get along but you
Didn't seem to have much of a interest
In living up to your own word
Yeah, I guess that's a littlesoType it's like saying I'm not your daddy
And I'm not your momma
But it's you and me
It's me and my daughter
I want you to know she belongs me and not some toy
That she shouldn't have
But I'm not gonna let her hold me back from growing up a hero
I want her to know that I love her
I'm so glad that you're here
That I'm your daddy, but you don't know what'sin'
You and your husband could get serious if he was on his knees
And I think what impressed you the most was the fact that
That I could trust you
And you were able to come up with some shitless shit
That didn't involve me
And you were able to come up with some shitless
So don't front and play with us
And let's clear this up for the son of a bitch
I see you bitches are all bitches, let's talk about a K

He used to pull my pants down to ease his lower back
Now I'm dropping, spitting, rhymes on the stereo
Thrust around my girlfriend's ass with no seat belt
Feel the wind blow on my dick, are you crazy Kim?
Bitch, I'm about to pull up
And I don't want no lines to begin with
So here we go, 13 years later, I'm still coming off that line
And all this time, I was just fine
Seeing as how crazy and how I am and what I been up to
But this time, I'm coming off that shit too
So you gotta let me go crazy
Man, I'm going bananas
Oh, this my jam, this my jam
The way it goes, bananas
This my my my jam, this my my jam
The way it goes, bananas
Oh, this my my jam, this my my jam

This is the story of a kid who lost his momma, went to college and became a songwriter
But his dad had a problem, so he took him to the doctor
And the damn aspirin was for side effects
Not the little kids, these little kids are all like that
This is the story of a kid who lost his momma, went to college and became a songwriter

This is the story of a kid who lost his momma, went to college and became a songwriter
But his dad had a problem, so he took him to the doctor
And the damn aspirin was for side effects
Not the little kids, these little kids are all like thatI think it's a waste of my time
All this time just jottin', jockin', jockin' and booin' and shit
Man I think it's comin', it's too late to save these little kids
I think it's fuckin' kinda cool to celebrate
And I think saving these little kids is justin' fun
To just jack and play and I think
That maybe it's time to go and just kill some more
But I'm not gonna do it just yet,
Can't I just get the job done
Man I'm glad that they got me at the pen
And I am, but I have a few more projects to complete before I'm finished
I'll have a nice cup of tea and a cup of coffee at the bonfire
And if you're still alive and you wish to get acquainted with my voice
I'll be glad to answer you all of your questions
Excuse me my ma's name but please understand
That I don't give a fuck, okay then
Madame Minister thou dost love me, I love her
And I don't give a fuck if she's a boy or a girl
I'll even give a fuck if she's a girl
But if she's a boy, I won't fuck you if she's a girl
If she's a girl, I won't fuck you if she's a girl
You see, I'm a tease, a silly thing to do
But I really do want to play, and play with myself
But lately I've been rockin' and I've been baby-boomer, yo
Baby, I think I'm doin' some yoga
Honey I think my bum is ticklin' off
I think I'll wear a dress and drink a bottle of liqueur
Cause I just don't have the room in my house for more bunnies
I think I'm too old to drive
Ya HaHa go to Wayne State
[Chorus]
It's a must a crib for boys
Boys may call me playin', but I ain't playin' jack
I'm makin' wack jack, but I'm still makin' jack
Play wack jack, but wack jack won't fuckin' give me that
Injuring, I've had testicles shoved in my ass
This is wack jack, this is wack jack
Yes sir, yes sir
[Verse 2]
This game is basic jock jack
But the concepts are more advanced, you know
And it's the sickest, sickest and most cynical
Formula your competitors is ill
From birth, you can look for a way to criticize
But you soon are put through
This is jack school, you're put through
This is jack jack school, you're put through
Ha ha kids is so sick it's ridiculous
Ha, ha, ha
[Verse 3]
You think you playin' with fire, you better put your bets
Put em in the ground and pull em out
It's jack toe school, you can call em sis
But remember when we played Source you should
Back out too fast
Don't put em in the ground, you can't push em out
It's jack toe school, you can call em sis
But remember remember remember kids is so sick it's ridiculous
Ha, ha, ha, ha
[Verse 4]
I lay in the sun, I'm warm, fuzzy and fuzzy and fuzzy
I'm so fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzy
I wake up in the morning, fuzzy, fuzzy fuzzy and fuzzy
I'm so fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzyI feel the ball, hit the post,
Fuzzy and fuzzy, I touch the ball,
Fuzzy and fuzzy, I hit the post,
Fuzzy and fuzzy, I hit the post
I said I'm back, or check the ball, hit the goal post
Fuzzy and fuzzy, I touch the ball,

It's a time of the year when I throw a party
You better throw a bomb on us
People go to work
When the President's with,
It's the people who go home
The people who go to church
The people who go to church
The people who go to church
The people who go to church
The people who go to church
The people who, the President's with
It's the people who go home

It's the people who go home
The people who go to work
The people who go to work
The people who go to work
The people who, the President's with
What's goin' on?
The plot has been laid
Let's go, when the President's here
When the President's here
When the President's here
Verse 2
So Joe Hill can his ass in the sand
I'm here for the mic, let's go
When the President's here
When the President's here
When the President's here

When the President's here
Verse 3
You never seen harder times
Managed to get by with a lot of debt
But you can't ignore us neither
Gotta fight to keep your chin out of the side of the room
So I'm standing here as a man
What the hell is goin' on?
I don't have no answers no more
You better hope that you got some answers
Next time you may sit down
In your living room and just talk about how much you miss the dog
How much you miss the dog
How come you could not even give us the hug you got
Through the grape vine, through the straw,
I'm a man so I'm a bitch
Still got shit on, but I'm whittin' up
Startin' to pray, started to hate you
Be tryin' to listen, is always a target, yeah
You know, I just wanna love you more
Just let you know that
Just let you know that
Just let you know that
Just let you know that
Just let me know
Alright
Alright
Come on
I think we done both left the same camp
Just learn to live with it, and keep it real
And just be realin' with your family
And partner it real
And hopefully through it and through it
You get the message, that you truly love your enemy
And get through with it
And all you see is more of the blue & the purple baby
Til it rids in, but not before you see your baby
See the tears well up in our eyes
We know you're sad, right?
Well, look at what you did for your wife
You did it hard, and it pays off
But tonight, you gotta kick your tires
And your spouse, so here's the money
And you kicked your spouse's tire pressure
Initiated, forced, decided
To make a new plan
And it's on, on
It's going to be a long time before the money comes
Before the pain does, leave us nothing to hate
And let's let the music out
Before the music stops
So breathe easy, you could hit the brake
And brake hard enough to not knock us off guard
We're not taking any damage, you just doing our duty
We're gonna take what we got
And let's roll
Never knew we could touch so many people
It's like a juggling act
You can't skip a beat, you miss the groove
You just can't live without it, can't afford to be a hypocrite
But fuck it, you can just afford to be nice to us
When the President's back at the D, we're back at it
Yo, if you don't like it, you can get the whole block in a single
Second, you can get your shit out
At the same time you know we love you
And we'll be soamer if you accept our apology
even if it means admitting we was wrong
and we still was right
If you just accept it
It's nothing, we're not coming back
Not even when the Detroit Lions come to town
[Verse 1]
They came to tell us, "Hey, we love you"
They said that the way you lookin, you should too
You should be able to look at us and say, "Wow"
We came to tell you, "
====================
They said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
I said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
I said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
I said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
I said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
My music is like a drug, like cocaine
I might be the best thing you've ever done for your child
My music is like a drug, like cocaine
I might be the best thing you've ever done for your child
You shouldn't listen to my music, if you do listen
It might make you sleepy, it might make you dizzy
Think of my daughter when you think of her
When you think of my daughter, think of my daughter
Think of my daughter, think of my daughter
Think of my daughter, think of my daughter
You shouldn't listen to my music, if you do listen
It might make you sleepy, it might make you dizzy
I just make you mad, I make you sick
You make her sick, you make her angry
I just make you mad, I make you
So what's the difference between me and you?
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm a normal MC, if you hear this then I'm dead
I just make you mad, I make you sick
You make her mad, you make her angry
I just make you mad, I make you
So what's the difference between me and you?
I'm on a mission to make a messianic MC
If you're not impressed you can't be boss
If you're faithful you can't be patient
I make the messianic crew feel welcome
If you're not my kind of MC
You make the paper thin bitch look easy,
If you're not Mathers you'll fuck a virgin
If you're not T-P then I'm gettin' the message easy
If you're not T-P then I'm gettin' the message easy
You're a fucking D and a rabbit,
You don't get to fuck with Mathers unless you want her baby
You're a fraud and you ain't no magician
But if you're not Mathers then I'm in the mirror,
You fucked yourself so bad you should fuckin' throw up a vagina
'Cause you find it disgusting and you degrade it
And you don't wanna come across a kid with that many razor's
In six inch of soap, when you find out that I tried to split
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to doubt your credibility
You're pathetic, it's obvious
You're starting to doubt your own fucking resilience
You're starting to doubt your own fucking resilience
You're starting to suspect your own fucking luck
You're starting to doubt your own fucking resilience
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
Yo this is your jam, yo this is your stomp
This is your fucking verse
This is your fucking chorus
This is your fucking lyric
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is stagedI'm starting to think this shit is staged
Now look
This shit's really happening
We on the cusp
Now it's almost a given
That we'll ever leave the same fucking creek
Now shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Then come around the corner
And look like a giant boulder
This boulder's about to send me down
Daddy's here to save me
Daddy's on my dick
I need a daddy to bounce
I'm a grown man,
I know that if I keep going
I will grow as a man
Baby, shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Oooh ooh, shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Oooh ooh, shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Ohh ooh, shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass,

Verse 1 [Verse 2]:
I'm in love with the dr.dre era, the more that you got me pissed off, the more that you squeezed me off you idiot, I'm a step beyond the hype, the hype, I'm the illest man, man, I'm the illest rapper to hold the roscoe hostage and blaster the puppet so violently, slap me and bounce off the puppet, go ahead slap me and bite him and eat the puppet, put the heat on him and heat on the emcees, cause I'm hot as the fuck and the hottest man inside you stinking faggot, I'm sick, I'm sick of emcees who just don't got it, who just don't have it, who just don't have the guts to say it, who are the big bad wolfs, who are feeding this hot shit this hot shit a taste as sour as the vodka and the pheny, who can stand in the sunlight and poke a nose in it, and still be able to rip a Granny Smith's head off, and still be able to get a headstart, and still get a living, and I don't really have a choice, I can pick which path I'm on, whether I want to go or not, I'm a picketed, you picket me, you can't pick which side you're on, it's like being on the fence, 'cause you can't pick which side you're on, you can't pick which side you're on. And so, I'm standing here with this hammered up shit, laying here with this battered up shit, and this whole house packed, and if I could just put it all into a single frame, I think I would, but it's like a double-hoof, like a tax preparer, and I'm reminded of the trailer backed preparer, and I think of the projects that were put in, and what a tangled web it was, so I just stopped putting together a single frame, and put all my eggs in one basket, and I think of the good old days when I would watch the news cycle and try to make a single statement, and try to make a single plea, and try to convince myself that it wasn't that big a deal, but it was closer to home, and put everything into perspective, and look at the size of this house, and the fact that this is happening at the same time pretty much says that this is my fault, you know, it's like putting together a Thanksgiving turkey, and it's almost like the centerpiece of the house, 'cause you know, look, I'm so big, and I'm not just any comedian, I'm, I'm the centerpiece of the house, and like, I'm not just any comedian, I'm, I'm the centerpiece of the dance floor, and I'm not just anybody, I'm, I'm the centerpiece of the dance floor.
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Cause man, I wouldn't give a fuck if it was Thanksgiving, I'd roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and

I'm going for whoever's taller than me
Who turned out the better tonight, to shake the world
And show us that you're still hungry too[Hook]

Daddy's mommy, and me and my niggas was down
And fed up, gotta have a daddy to hold
So I'm like, "you're gonna have to take your two niggas out there and try to turn them into stars"
And y'all little kids, thinkin' it'll just be another day
But I told you once, it's only when you see daddy and see your niggas
And you see your niggas down in the streets
And you see them in action, like down in a zoo
And you see em go down in a couple of days, that's a trend, that's what,

You got the point, but you got most of all your man that got a
Bad breath in your voice

====================
Your friends always tell me, "You can't do that shit on your own".
My friends see me as a bad mite,
Cause they say I was smart,
And I'm a throwback to the 50's,
When I was scolded and told off by my high school coach,
I just kept speaking a different language,
Cause it wasn't in my vocabulary, but the things I liked.
Two syllables, two syllables, two syllables.
Nigga, I'm from the 50's
Killing the man in cold blood,
Then I'm bringing the country to his knees,
I'm standing in front of a camera,
I'm not afraid of what's coming its way,
You can be black, white or even just ok with yourself
Like I'm not scared at all, and I'm bringing the world to its knees,
I'm standing in front of a camera,
I'm not afraid of what's coming its way,
You can be black, white or even just ok with yourself
Yo, yo

And I ain't playin' that game,

I said
This is what the song called to the group
And I ain't goin back
Lately, I've felt lonely
I don't go to the club
But somewhere in the club,
I met a girl
I don't know why
I felt so alone
I didn't know where I was
I went to the mall
But now,
I feel like I'm goin back to my old life
Cause everywhere I go,
People are goin' so fast
I'm tryin to keep it real
I just want to be back
And it is
But I'm having so much fun
Roving at the same time
Just so jealous
Of all the people that think
I'm tryin to impress 'em
I'm tryin to make 'em hate me
I'm tryin to impress 'em
I'm tryin to impress 'em
I'm tryin to impress 'em

And all I see is sirens
Every time I look

I'm coming, I will never stop
I'm standing in the mirror, mirror in my face
I¼ a child star, makin' a makin' noise
is everybody hearin' Our message be clear?
Is everybody knowin' That what they act like?
Is everybody knowin' That they act like they want to impress
Me? I'm actin' like fuck them all
I'll be the one who claims to be the one, but seems to be walkin'
Behind the camera
ahead of her time
In the papers shokin' like Jessica Alba
Everybody's lookin' at me like I'm crazy
Everybody knows that she's boppin'
But what everybody don't know is
That
has become my mission as the man
To represent the people
So
I am menstruating, and
I don't wanna leave without
a little bit of this skin off
And I am, this is it
Dr Dre coming through, Dre
You know why they call me Doc?
Because when I'm not on the microphone
they ain't playing with my Eroding
Freidrich and Shady and Hennessy
I don't want to mess with nobody so
I went for a blood bath
a x-ray done and a x-ray whip whipped
and eyeball swooshed, show me!
So I splish my pan between two gauges
chick drizzle on glasses of water
goin' over my dead grandmother's grave
blue Jays jackets with Jayson Tins on them
and my trench coats that show through pores
still mixing detergent
to wipe my eyes with while I'm hollerin'
 'Cause I'm kickin' 'em off ahead
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I'm high as hell, high as the Injek
I'll make the world go 'round
I'll make you go 'round
I'll make you up like a square inch
of forest fir
And force you to look like a square inch
of concrete
I made this rap album out of this
I made this rap album out of this
You make rap music, you eat shit up
and sleep, and dead down
I put this on through
And this won't even let you rap if you thirsty
you get your wish now
[Obie Trice]

I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close itI'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
Yo, I took too long
To think I was down with the M-O
Ha ha, I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close itI'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close itI'm a living horror, I don't love it

So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love itI in, I outI'm not ashamed
To say I'm green
My stomach is full of coke
If it was just me, it wouldn't be
I in the mirror
Loving it but.. I.. I feel like, I.. I feel like..
I'm so girl, me and my boo-boo
Is so girl, me and my boo-boo
Shady, Shady, aftermath
[Lloyd Banks' voice:]
I'm coming to the front door, to sneak in, knock in the door
But in the darkness, I hear the sirens
I go to step in the door, but as I go in I see
A naked man in a bed with his genitals slit
Gaffi, fucking war, fucking little boy, faggot,
Get your brains blown out, and put a heel through his fuckin'
Stick his fuckin' penis up through his asshole
You little sicko, I'll let him suck my fucking cock
Your motherfucking asshole, now your thinking like a motherfuckin' sheep
Little motherfuckin' cunt, you're fuckin' with a motherfuckin' boss
You're motherfuckin' a boss, you're fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mistress
Then there's a knock at the door
It's the hairy faggot, your motherfuckin' mouth
You can call her Bonnie, but I won't let Bonnie touch my
Baby sitter, you better hide your damn magnet
Bitch, shut the fuck up and just layin' when you see me
When you fuckers' bitch, hang your cables, I'll unhook
I'm a minute tickin' off this list
I wanna erase all this pain
I wanna make it look so much easier
I got you bitches hopping on the futon
Bitch, I ain't even gotta tick this off
I got you bitches hopping on the futon
You get your bitch hopped on the futon
I got you bitches
====================
Trying to figure out how to get rid of that fake beef
How do you beef with a beefhead and not get caught?
How do you beef with a comedian and not get caught?
Better get the clip of the microphone
Catch me, bitch!
I'm not an actor, I'm an ultramarathoner
Running on fumes, my oxygen demand me
A father and son team effort
It's the greatest gift you can get
You could ever get
So don't get me wrong
I'm not a bad guy
I'm a dad
You need to give me two things
Psych to help me burn through the grief
(1)
A therapist who's willing to talk about my life
(2)
A friend who's willing to talk about my life
Yeah, so what
I'm not a great guy
I'm not a great guy
Get it mono?
Yeah, I'm not a great guy
Jingle Bells, the steel brain
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth
Back up
Yeah, that's a nice way to start things off
Back you in the day when you was talking to me
I would always joke
That you used to joke with me
Every time you flushed me down the toilet
I would always get a mention
The one time that I used to boast
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth
Back up
Yeah, that's a nice way to start things off
Back you in the day when you were talking to me
I would always point out
The one time that I used to boast
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth
Back up
Yeah, that's a nice way to start things off
Back you in the day when you were talking to me
I would always point out
The one time that I used to boast
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth
Back up
Yeah, that's a nice way to start things off
Back you in the day when you were talking to me
I would always point out
The one time that I used to boast
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth[Intro]
Yo
There's a certain mystique when I speak that you notice immediately
Cause you just know immediately it's just the vibe that I get
Cause when I speak it's just absolutely jaw-dropping
Cause when I'm saying it I'm talking about absolute jaw-dropping
[Verse 1]
I'm talking to you, all those who thought that I couldn't breathe and pray that I can't
Now I'm just living inside of a five minute talk
So you think 'well it's kind of a fake company man, but I'm just Jay, so it's true')
I'm talking to you, y'all know that I just don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it
So get the fuck out the booth
[Verse 2]
The crowd goes bananas
I guess it's time for the son of a bitch to step up
He screams fuck the world
And I just said it
And he's right
World wide I'm just laughing and cuddling him
And I don't give a fuck with his father
So long as he stays within my zone of comfort
You better give em hell like they always do
They say that every single day that passes
They get more violent than the first time
Shit more like the English louse cause em
They say that I just make fun of his skin tone
So long as he stays inside my zone of comfort
You better give em hell like they always do
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Faggot, faggot, faggot
I guess it's time for the son of a bitch to step up
He screams fuck the world
And I just said it
And he's right
World wide I'm just laughing and cuddling him
And I don't give a fuck
So long as he stays inside my zone of comfort
You better give em hell like they always do
[Verse 4]
I know you thought we were done
We been moving ever since then
It's been an incredible time
It's been an incredible time
It's been an incredible time
It's been an incredible time
It's been an incredible time
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
I'm mixing it up with an ukulele
And I'mma fight with you
Your not even scratching
I'm scratching at the woodwork
I'm matcheling up your love
I want to beat the shit
====================
Can't leave Shady Worldwide
Can't leave him, I don't want to be alone
And I can't leave him
[Chorus]
Oh, he's crazy, he don't wanna grow up
He don't want to, he don't want to (be alone)
But what can he do, he's crazy
He's crazy, he don't want to (be alone)
But what can he do, he's crazy
[Verse 2]
He don't want to give up (bothering)
He don't want to, he don't want to (coddling)
He's Crooked I'm sayin'
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
Of my word, you can count on me
I count on you Crooked I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 3]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Justin
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 4]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 5]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 6]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 7]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 8]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 9]
I'm a big fat ass, and I don't like fuck-ups
I'ma keep it down, no conversation took place
I'm a gangster, so every time I go to meet you in the lobby
I'ma keep a close eye on you, as much as we might get fucked
Could make or break you, if we don't meet in the mall
Or if we do meet in the same bitch, clothes, and place
Let your guard down, it's a tight spot that we both have
We'll see each other in the hospital, soon enough
We may sweat, no matter how many times we say the hospital doorbell
We may rock the parkin' garage door closed
Walkin' around shooting up the block, in your face
'Cause we're so close, no one knows us, no one wants to know
Even though we're friends, we're just parents,
We're just friends, no one wants to know
Even though we're parents, we're just parents,
We're just parents,
We're just parents,
Shit, it's the season to the bone, ho
Come fall we're gonna kick your ass, we're gonna rock your butt
Fuck no jokes, we're just Notimes, we're not peas in your face
We're just Footloose, you're singing the same song
And you're fucking with the same crew, no one is gonna listen
So welcome, to the troupe that's performing "I'm Sorry" please
Please don't upset us, we're just happy to fit in
And we're just your angelic little sidekick,
Don't ever try to separate us, I'm not trying to
Cause we're just happy to fit in
And we're just happy to fit in
[Chorus]
There's a certain mystique when I speak that you notice
Cause it's sort of unique, like when I speak
Cause I talk about my thoughts and my prayers
And it's always enlightens me to just a little bit
Cause when I'm quoting scripture it's always in my thoughts
And when I'm speaking through a human being I'm always speaking to
My fellow human, cause when I'm talking I'm talking to a
Human
I use my body as a whip, and when I'm speaking
I'm speaking with both hands, and I'm always addressing
My fellow man, cause when I'm speaking I'm speaking to a
Human
I use my body as a whip
====================
Show them hell and escape from there
Show em where the hell we are at
We are not cops or prosecutors
We are the people's chosen
Constitutional America, where all your favorite artists are murdered
Rappers murdered and songwriters driven
They plan to leave songwriters
To go see critics and be nostalgic
For when the hate grows colder
They'll resort to means to retaliate
Such as ice the waters of hatred
And the weapon of choice
Is the underground
The underground America, where all your favorite artists are murdered
Rappers murdered and song writers drove
They plan to leave song writers
To go see critics and be nostalgic
For when the hate grows colder
They'll resort to means to retaliate
Music is life, and we are never colder
The more lyrical, the more brutal the killer, the more cynical the killer
You can see us, through the fog
We don't know you, there's only so cold we can see
The road to hell is cold, only the light can save
They call us Superman, they call us Motherfuckers, we're villains
They wanna save us, they wanna see us go
Was never a dream, but the closer we got
The closer they got
The closer they got to hell
I never dreamed I can walk into a room with a fire place cover and a sheet over my head
And still be able to talk, 'til the beat, the smoke rises
I never dreamed I can smoke, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can ball, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can swim, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can golf, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can land, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can fly, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can run, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can ball, but I did when I was a childDre: I think it's been a long time comin', and I'm comin' to get it done
I had a rough time, but I don't wanna make excuses
Faced so much adversity, and came to find it's still today
Even if I'm gone, I know that I've not died yet
I know that I don't love you dawg
But tonight, I'm comin' back to try ta help youg
And it's just the first of; kunai, toni
And ga-ga, so to speak
Isama a, comin' to change the way that I'm comin back to you
Cause when I come back, I wanna be you still
Cause when I touch down, I don't wanna just leave you alone
But I wanna go down this road and show you where you-
From, Japan to, America, yo
Now when I walked this girl down this flight
There wasn't one, two, three, four, five
 like they used to call me, now
Sometimes I think, maybe I should just call it quits
I'm gotta hunt this cat , 'cause this ain't the time
For squirrelries, I'm scared to eat the scratch
It's too sad , I come from the woods
Or should I say plains , 'cause I don't need to go that far
I think about you every day and how much I miss you
And how much I just washed you up
I think about you now , and how much I just dunno
And how much time I wasted talking to you
I think about you now , and how much I just dunno
And how much I just drank your milk, guess I should have seen it coming
And how much you just flat out rejected me
I've been to as far as the trees
And as far as the cats , I've been waiting
For your body to settle in , I've been shovelling it
And if cat paws isn't the answer , then SHUT UP
It's 2001 and young Nicki
You need to keep poppin' that you pussy
Your acting like a slut on my reality TV
But I bet you I'll be back if i see you again
And if I go back to that time wasting on your video
I wouldn't want you to think I'm anti-women
But it's true , I hate it when I see it
 , and I hate it worse when I spit it
 but it ain't nothing to shush
'Cause when I go to fuck you in the ass with that sound
I'll spit the shit out you before i kill you
Gettin' redundant , 'cause i gotta spit it out
Or maybe you need one fuckin' stripper
And one of those is on your fucking ass
And when you see it on

What a tangled web we weave
I'm in the wrong room trying to turn off the oxygen
I'm in the room with the wizard, yeah the ropes
I need a change of pace, I need tenacity
I need to get it across to the new kid on the block
It's been a rough year for the hard-working, but forgotten
People in this room are just as angry
They know me and my struggle as they know me
And it's been a long time coming to terms with the fact
That I don't get paid, I've been standing by it
And it's hurtin me heart to heart
But it's also hurtin me mind
To the point where I'm thinkin of new ways to say it
And I just need to make it work for me
For the people in this room who don't know me
Who don't know what a tangled web we weave
I'm in the wrong room trying to turn off the oxygen
It's been a rough year for the hard-working, but forgot

Yeah, it's kinda like a flashback, like a little snippet of my life then
[Verse 1]
All I remember is having this moment
Being in that chair and having that feeling
And it was, like, oh my gosh, I must have
Took her by surprise
At first, it was like wow
[Verse 2]
I remember looking up and I gotta stare at this sky
I couldn't see much
And then I remembered this
Airport
[Verse 3]
It was, like
At first, it was like oh my gosh, I must have
Took her by surprise
At first, it was like oh my gosh, I must have
It was, like

Two to the one from the one to the three
I like to mix it up with the beat, just to make sure
I don't forget something important
Something I hold most sacred
Something I'll never forget
And I do it well
Spiritual life is in the house, it's us
It's up to you to make the most of it
You did it, us, us, us
You just
don't know, you just
don't know
When to shut up,
I'm the one who's leaning on you
You're the one who's leaning on me
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
Aight, here, let me start you off with the first verse
Before they put me on the needle, I'd just start this blood
And spit in your eyes while

It's been too long no longer the time has passed has been left over from the same batch of shit that passed
You put your life in this, now it's your time to throw it around
So start throwin' your fucking lives in chaos
[Guardians]
It's been too long no longer the time has passed has been left over from the same batch of shit that passed
You got your, own damn pride, you got your shit stopped
You took the place of, the hero that people thought you couldn't play
You threw your shit up in the game, now you throw it around like a man and pretend it ain't shit
[Eminem & Vegito]
Oh hell no..
Oh hell, I think I just..
Oh hell, I think I just..
Oh hell, I think I just have a little bit of envy
I don't fight shit, take it as it is, I'm not that nice
To fight for the respect I feel I'm not that smart
The system ain't working, so I'm starting from scratch
And slowly but surely I'm getting my due
And I'm beginning to feel my full potential..

I don't know much, but I just feel grateful
When I hear good MC's, I get a woody

Eminem:
Sentiential, no reason not
What's this guy gon' be after?
Guess who's home?
I think he's dead
Brain dead
Liable, non-stop
Lotto, non-stop
I just got a body to haul
The wind is against me
I'm a little stressed out from work
Couldn't stay up at night
Wont you please stop bein' your host
I'm a makin' your night
Sleep on my side
Just pull the plug
I'm a feel the sting from the load
Just let the gas go
The wind is against me
I'm a little stressed out from work
Couldn't stay up at night
Wont you please stop bein' your host
I'm a makin' your night
Sleep on my side
Just pick the pillow up and pillow it
And smack it in your sleep so bad you wonder how
If you got the chance, you did nothing
I gotta hustle a living and feed the hungry
I'm livin' my life expectancy
I'm sick of the static
Clinically depressed
Refused to change
Stole the shit
Turn the radio on
Smoke the drug game
I'm a criminal
Put my blood on the game board
I'm a competitor
Put my mind to the wheel
Kill rappers I know how to the wheel
So when the gangstas get down I'm like a snail
I just hit the floor bitch
You can call it kindness in my eyes

Right, right, yo
What the fuck are you doing?
Fucking babies, what the fuck you call a b****?
You little girls are too scared to scream, they're thin skin on the fence
Of motherfuckin' cops to fucking muh'uns.
Right, right, right, yo
What the fuck are you up to, ho?
You know what time it is, you need a minute to think
What are you doing? What are you armed with?
What are you scared of?
What is you Crazy?
What is she up to?
How long are you think this?
How old are you?
How old did you have to be to just light this bitch up?
How old are you?
You know what time it is, you need a minute to think
What are you up to, you need a minute to think
How old are you?
How old are you?

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Think I never knew you this sick
When I met you, you might as well
Be a wit' my bitch
And wear' my coffin
Inside it
Some people just don't like to talk
The fuck is wrong with this man
He's no comedian
None of them doctors or cops
What the fuck is he suppose to be?
A father figure to me
A lyricist and a composer of symphonies
And a poet
And a lotta vocals
Playin' with live wires
Cleaning the coffin
When it's wiped

Yeah, I love it
Hop off to Amsterdam and get your mama some presents
Just to meet you out in the park
Before you get taken away at the county pen
'Cause your mama's a bust a bust

Get in bed with me and beat the lawn mower

====================
This is what I call a happy marriage
A few borderline bouts, some I caught in the grind
But the hatred is gone, the lust is gone
The days are cold livin' without you
But the nights are warm and the months are cold
I'm living without you and you're dying for me
I love you so much I want you to melt off the inside of my skin
I put a knife in her heart, I'm sorry she had to endure
The thought of leaving me and leaving you just don't exist
I'm sick of playing the game and dying, I can't handle this pain
The stress is unbelievable, the nights are warm and the months are cold
I'm living without you and you're dying for me
I put a knife in her heart, I'm sorry she had to endure
The thought of leaving me and leaving you just don't exist
I'm sick of playing the game and dying, I can't handle this pain
I paint the house, I'mma play for the hills
You call the cops, we ride, death scar looms, life ain't too shabby
The streets are empty without us
The police will buy the game, I'mma let you kick it
I'mma show you where the weed was mixed
And who the target was, jay-z portion, pack your bags
We gonna columbia, cus it'll be great when we get to your burial
So death's over, so we say goodbye
So we can phase us
We keep calling ourselves
The Gang of Four
50 Cent and D-12
We keep getting approached
Tipped in the ribs
Bandaged my wrist
Gonna have to restyle my wound
Been dealing with these phlegm harassers
Holding a squeegee
And I don't need one
These phlegm haters tried to shit on me
Someone pushy phlegm so what
I'm down with phlegm
Gimme the mic, let me recite
Keep the mics on the shelf
Keep feeding these phlegm mics
All the life outta my shoulder
It's like a bottle of Dimethicone
And I know what it does
To the ligaments and ligaments
Of my shoulder blades
Like some maniac with a disco ball in his face
It cuts, I walk the streets smiling
Like a maniac who cut his toes off
And just happens to be his shrink
Wait a minute, this guy's his fuckin shrink
Wait he's not, there he is
A crazy man, he seems to be doing stand up
Repetitive beatings make him not feel up
This guy seems to be in his mid-twenties
And he talks a good talk, he may be speakin a little harder
But you can't stop him, he's in the wrong chair
He's lookin for someone to beat the buzz
Someone to knock the fuck out and hug 'till they suffocate to nowhere
To nowhere, they suffocate to somewhere
To kill and eat, this guy's probably addicted
He may be high but he ain't not
He's got a penis and a bellied butt
So when you knock on our door and you knock
"Hello?"
"Is there a friend you can trust?"
"Yeah, looks like this guy I'm supposed to thank him"
So get off of me, you trippiest, I'm not over you
You're gonna get this high, I'm not over you
I'm over you, trippin' over you
You're gonna get this high, I'm not over you
You're gonna get this high, I'm not over you
[Chorus]
It's (The) only (hell) you really care about is your girl
Bitch you're gonna fuck me up if you don't get out of me girl
Get down to business, what are you doin'?
Get down to business to speak to me
Get down to business, what are you doin'?
You're gonna get this high, get this high
You're gonna get this high, get this high
You're gonna get this high, get this high
You're gonna get this high, get this high
[Eminem]
This game is like a crumb, rolled, and pushed
To the next level, this rhymes like a circus animal
Don't stop, you're gonna get this high, I'm not over you
And this is like the night that we both went insane
And I woke up in the morning with this big fat ass breakfast
"How come I don't get sick from this?"
"Because I know you'll never get it, shit you sick!"
"You're not the one that's getting sick, do you?"
"I don't know, shit you don't know
====================
Bored with my life? Don't be one of them
'Cause life ain't no fair, no chance
Everything is gonna pay off
I'm alive and well, I'm just a sick, sick sick sick
Whoo-ho, Shady!
I'm so sick, I'm stomach-churning
I can't eat, I'm having a seizure
I have an E rash on my leg
I'm taking rash drops while on vacation in Japan
I'm writing this rhyme with rhymes, folks, I don't see a rhyme
No more, I'm moving on
Who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my life, I'm a sick, sick sick
I'm sick, sick, I'm an asshole
Yo, who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
Yo, who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
Yo, who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
Yo, who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
Hey ho, what'd you write on the napkin?
Here's my last rhyme
Yo, I ain't even writing this
I got my last rhyme coming out of that bitch
Yo, is that a pistol?
This is my house, I'm coming with some raps
Yo, is that a pistol grip?
This is a house, this is my blood
You're coming with me, come with me
Every time I'm pushed, I'm pushed
To the ground, with the ground floor
The size of McDonald's beefin'
And my house, with the floorboard
I'm coming with you, come with you
Every time I'm pushed, I'm pushed
To the ground, with the ground floor
The size of McDonald's beefin'
And my house, with the floorboard
My blood flow goes, way beyond the sum
Of My Lyrics, is a spirit that flows
through every vein, I keep growing
capacity that I never realized
capacity that I never realized
capacity that I never realized
It's the Shady, aftermath of the attack
Your pen and your microphone will never leave my mind
It's Aftermath, Slaughterhouse, Recovery
It's Recovery, aftermath of the events of
97 years ago this week.
It's a look and a void
of us that never existed, we all die one day
It's like two halves of the same shit
I guess we just never grew up, it's just that old
Conversation and numb
I just wanna grow old together, yeah, that's right
Y'all little morons, you little queers hate you, you'll just get old, new year
Neil Young, ain't got no legs, you little shit, go get fixed
Pajama time, next time you'll see my legs
I'll put 'em on again, on the wall, with some glue
I think I did it, I really did, I did it for my last mama
Now her name is Alana, she's the one who taught me how to love
Love is the root of all evil
How could I love my baby girl, she won't even swallow
When I kick the dirt off her, she'll grow up to me
And I don't blame her
I put 'em on and they keep on going, but the dumb part
enshed off and on, the dented off
I was 'bout to spit in her, but I gotta get her
But I can't, I can't, I can't, go on
I hate this, but I'm not the type of guy who tries to get intimate with his girlfriends
I can't, but I'll just get over him and get them up
And that's it, that's it, that's all there was to it
I guess that meant the bad part didn't stop, but then I got the call
It was time to move on, at least for the short term
But once I got the chance, I just fell in love
With the idea of moving on, at least for the short
Term
Short term, I'm busy trying to plan
So that ends up
====================
We're living in the dark
'Cause we don't see
And when we
Call
Guard
Nine-Nine-Nine
You gotta kick the bucket
'Cause we ain't showing up for court
All we do is scream
'Cause we ain't cooperating
And when we
Come back we'll be takin' court
While we're still out on the porch
Bumping and pounding the beat
I'm still here
But I'm ballin' in this muthafucking booth
So the party's off to a stand
Just tacklein' the line and we'll get it
And shove this muthafuckin ass chick in the back
And we'll roll 'til we lost her
And we'll tell the world at least we got proof
I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back
'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dykeLadies and gentlemen
You have now witnessed the strength and the minutiae
Of a lifetime in motion capture
Formative years spent in synchronicity
Statistically critical of a newborn
Modest individual to a major player
A symbol of adolescent rebellion
A symbol of adolescent defiance
A symbol of adolescent defiance
Persistence in pursuing a mission
Faith in pursuing a mission
Religiously dedicated to the mission
Lord be praised and thanks be to God
Informal prayer
Overseas, to concerts and conventions
Overseas, to concerts and conventions
Come and get me
Come and get me
Come and get me
Ohh boy oh girl oh
Come along follow me
Come along follow me
Come along follow me
Gonna make a mess of these vocals
Overseas, to concerts and conventions
Overseas, to concerts and conventions
Come and get me
Come and get me
Come and get me
Come and get me
Yo
Yeah girl shake that ass
You don't believe what we saying
Girl you gon' be alright
Shady made it
So it's my turn to follow your nose
Where you gone is where my head is
Came back
Back (repeat)
[Eminem]
Where's my snare
You wanna catch a glimpse of my grin
where's your stereo?
where's my dither
where's my head?
where's my stereo
Yeah, where you gone girl
Where you gone girl
You know what time it is
cause I'm kinda feeling thin
I guess I'm starting to fake
I'm kinda feeling thin
I guess I'm starting to fake
Alright
I'm going for a loop
I'm getting high, I'm getting high
I killed the rumors,
you don't like it
you're endearing yourself
but the bees are not dear
I need a vaccine
you get rich if this is true
you can't live without this
you're so much of a nuisance
thatyou're no good if you're making noise
you get so caught up in your music
thatyou get lost in it
thatyou can't even focus on your music
you're staring at a sky sky
It's like a sea of jelly, I'm out of place
I've been piling on top of the last one
I got to go back to the drawing board
I need to see how much you like it
I've been piling on top of the last one
I ain't going out and flaunting myself
I need to see how much you like it
girl
I used to get so mad at my own label
that I would put up my own album on it
[Eminem]
You see I love myself so fuck it
I'm putting this tape on display
I'm not going to stop, I need to get off to a rocky start
like a tire iron
I'm not stopping just cause this tape is on
I don't know why everybody keeps calling me Eminem
I just think he made excuses
for his mistakes but he didn't give a fuck
why the fuck would he give a fuck
I'm starting to believe that Marshall Mathers died on his fuckin' record
I'm starting to believe that his ghost is back
I'm starting to believe that his foots went in his ass
I'm starting to believe that his heart was moved inside his body
====================
I'm resting on my ass
Just laying on the floor
Shoving a piece of cardboard into a gaping wound
Biting the sex and excitement
I'm mopping the floors
And wiping my ass with it
I'm fucked up worse when I'm underground
Than I am in a mirror
Shallow in my sorrow
Everything is so dark
Where is you at?
You gon' need a flashlight to see
Where is the light at?
I guess I just, forgot
Where I,
Go underground
You know where I'm going
You know I...
I'm underground
There,
In every,
every,
the,
I know what I'm,
I know what I'm
You know I am
[Verse 1]
I am what you thought I was...
I am what you thought I was...
You are what I am...
You are what I am...
You are what I am...
You are what I am...
[Verse 2]
I'm standing in the flames
I'm fireproof, I'm cold enough that I won't suffocate
I'm lit so the flames won't reach me
They said I'd make it to the basement
Just to break up the heat
They said I'd make it to the attic
To the dry ditch
To put you in the trauma center
I'm cold enough to freeze
To treat you to Soma
I'm pissed off

To take a life and I'm not afraid
To let you fuck with the way I go,

To be you, I'm not afraid
To be you

Fuck it I'm sick enough to have a vasectomy
I'll have a vasectomy
[Chorus]
You are now witnessing the final, physical
====================
I'm sick of D-12
I'm sick of these nigga-changers
I'm sick of the 30
I'm sick of 20th century notions of minimum wage
Fuck that, turn that shit into liquor
Fuck that, turn that shit into liquor
I'm sick of these niggas that's different
That's differentI cause you fucking american
You think you own this shit when you own a fucking D-Back
If you can't fucking live without itAye, Weezy!

I'm all for the weak and the weak
Bringing hip hop to anybody who wanna try it
I told you once, so take this microphone seriously
I told you twice, so now we have 30th anniversary now
Yeah, it's a little bit on the sudden
But remember when Ronnie died
It was a tragedy

(Wanda Sykes)
Hi, my name is,
Sophie Turner.
I'm a shy young lady.
I'm always horny.
I pee in the sink,
Hey, hey, stop playin'
I'm never shy in the hallway
I got a question,
(Do you have a shy child?)
Dawg, what's a puppy do?
Do you have a shy one?
Hi, my name is,
Sophie Turner.
I'm a shy young lady.
I'm always horny.
I pee in the sink,
Hey, hey, stop playin'
I'm never shy in the hallway
I got a question,
(Are you afraid of slim?
Are you scared of little kids?
Hi, my name is,
Sophie Turner.
I'm a shy young lady.
I'm always horny.
I pee in the sink,
Hey, hey, stop playin'
I'm never shy in the hallway
I got a question,
(Do you have a shy child?
My mom's scared daddy's not shy, my dad's scared daddy's not shy)
My brain's like a rabbit hole,
[Chorus]
I'm shy, my man is shy
Hi, my name is,

I pee in the sink,
Hey, hey, stop playin'

My mom's scared daddy's not shy, my dad's scared daddy's not shy)
My brain's like a rabbit hole,

(I'm going to jail. I'm going to jail. Yo, yo)
Yo, yo

(Tryna get me off of probation. Tryna get me off of probation)
(Tryna get me off of probation. Tryna get me off of probation)
I'm a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I mean the world, I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I'm terrified at the sight of someone I can trust
I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I mean the world, I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
Nobody wants to see from me, nobody wants to see from me
And they don't want to see any proof, that I sold out all of New York
And they don't want to see from me, anybody, even if they wanted to see if they wanted me
I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I mean the world, I walk like a

This is an interview, with DJ Shadow
[Intro]
Yeah yeah
My name is DJ Shadow, I'm a.m. hock to the underground music.
I made this shit up, and I mean shit to this day
This is my life, and I'm still gonna make shit up
I don't know why this shit's falling apart at the seams
I'm constantly being watched, every single word
This is my life, and I'm still gonna make shit up
I don't know why this shit's falling apart at the seams
I'm constantly being watched, every word
This is my life, and I'm still gonna make shit up
Yo, yo
[Verse 1]
I come around like a poisonous reptile, with a spiked bat
A symbol of destruction, of course I come around like an axe
So it's a little while until I show how I'm killing off
I'm Mr. Shady, a.k.a. the clown
Mr. Shady is my attitude toward everything
That I posses
My pen is all, I'ma get more pens than Kanye, Pencils
And I got all these numbers on my phone
I get people when they visit my page, page pages
And e-mail me back, "What you read on the page was not a pen
You signed an autograph for" (Yeah!)
So the cats just get kicked, and I'mma die for
My lyrical acumen is under attack, and it's getting late
I'm trying to get past the dog and cat attacks
I'm just trying to get the massive Troy support
I'm moving past the fight and get into this big game
Bullyin' and disrespectful, and I ain't even talkin' to no one
So please understandin' I'm never attemptin' this again
And I'm never tryin' to leave another man without the consent of the motherfucking co-pil
And I'm tryin' to live up to these expectations
That are not even being met
And I'm tryin' to raise my standards with this record
And I'm proud to say I was awake one sound
A chorus chorus got me on the stereo
Looking like a mummy, with decomposing skin
Wintoin' what you might be gettin' hit with a white paint
So wake up and get your shells buildin'
A shell chorus got me up and I'm laughing
It was a while ago when I was just gibbin'
And starin' with my snail
And you see you with your eyeballs up in a tub
And I'm just gonna stop working
And you save it for the closing credits
And I'm done with this bitch
So watch what you say
I'm not tryin' to leave
I just wanna be right
And I done told you once
You see that little boy
The bad guy
Who's trying to rob you
Ain't tryin' to hurt no one
Why would I wanna hurt no one?
They don't even try to handle me
See these eyes rolled up like a cross between a potholed road and a dark desert desert
Ain't no easy kid to be Rudolph
He seems to have no friends up in his gats
And his first few days are filled with misery
His confidence is slipping
He`s halting to think that he`s finally gonna break
And what a life he`s leaving
He`s gonna make it, he ain't gonna lie
Life is a bitch
But I guess we can get Hollywood doggin` the time
So watch what you say
I'm not tryin' to leave
I just wanna be right
And I done told you once
You see that little boy
The bad guy
Who's trying to rob you
Ain't tryin' to hurt no one
Why would I wanna hurt no one?
They don't even try to handle me
See these eyes rolled up like a cross between a potholed road and a dark desert
Ain't no easy kid to be Rudolph
He seems to have no friends up in his gats
And his first few days are filled with misery
His confidence is slipping
He`s halting to think that he`s finally gonna break
And what a life he`s leaving
He`s gonna make it, he ain't gonna lie
Life is a bitch
But I guess we can get Hollywood doggin the time
So watch what you say
I'm not tryin' to leave
I just wanna be right
And I done told you once
You see that little boy
The bad guy
Who's trying to rob you
Ain't tryin` to hurt no one
Why would I wanna hurt no one?
They don't even try to handle me

====================
And that's the gist of it
'Cause you'll be sorry if she gets in the way
(What happened to the grace period?)
Cause I was so young, and I thought I was doing amazing
What a dysfunctional childhood, with just an uncle and a stepfather
And a mama vanda, a trunk and a sledge-hammer
My mother, on the other hand was kind of a
Papa Vanda, had a fucking uncle, a crazy childhood
And aunts and uncles, but they didn't mind me
And mom still tries to make it work for us
And the gang's on the Potteries, I don't want to be alone
I'm afraid of what? Krypton, I cried wolf, and my mom
Don't play with my mom 'cause what's her toy, bitch?
It's not enough for her to fall back on, yeah
The line is too long, she might as well stick to the guns
But the moms that I know
Don't want to grow up, 'cause their moms wouldn't be together
And it's like a shadow world, where no one sees you, you weren't strong
And mom doesn't want to see you, you're scared to look at her
Pee, on the floor, with her legs spread wide open
Are you afraid of what? Murder, rape, adultery, cock shop
Where's my kid, he's just an infant, he's scared to look at his mum
Are you afraid of what? Murder, rape, adultery, shop
I just love my city, ain't it?
Yah, it's beautiful, but I wish I could be somewhere
Not knowin' enough to be
Where my kids grow up, bein' bullied, bullied
I don't know it's like my city is no where to be pooh-poo
But it is what it is,I guess they call me Buffalo Bob
I guess that means my kids don't know about me
They call me Buffalo Bob
I guess that means my city is no where to be pooh-poo
But it is what it is,I guess that means my city is no where to be pooh-poo
Ha ha, Detroit, n****s back, Detroit, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back, n****s back
N****s back, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back
Oh, I don't know, n****s back
Oh, I don't knowIf it's the speed or the boulder weighing us both
We need each other
We needing, one pill

One shot please
The streets are changing
My back shot just in,
The bullets just grazing your chest
Check box, I don't feel like stepping
It's too late to start over
Sending a clear message
I'm not going to return
Your messages were too sick to sit
I had too much on my plate
to go,
And I needed three more shots
so here it is
Six more years of wrong
I'm coming to stop at nothing
I'll be back
Even if it means a thousand mile stare-i-down,
Scarlet fever, oh, it's in my hair
So here it is
Six more years of going, going,
Going, sorry we couldn't agree with nothing
we fought like hell, and died like none other
I'll be dead wrong, killing a God-damn ghost
only thing making me sick and tired of
this city that's never changing
Just changing, no longer being true to size
Still trying to wrap my mind around the idea of
living like this again
The denizen, the outsider, the outsider
Living in the moment, the outsider, the outsider
The outsider, the outsider, the outsider
No matter how hard you try, you won't change
you will always have the problem
My neck is broken, I'm mopping the floor,
Still trying to figure out who did what, and who got hurt
both, especially when you can't change
your mind is bound to be our, ours
We can't afford to be insane again
But we can afford to be here, at least for now
[Chorus]

My tec
My mic
My pen
I just try to get the picture?
I'm tryna leave, what do I see?
I see something
I see something
I see something
I see somethingI see something
Shove a knife in the back of a living hell
Let it be known
Eminem has left
This whole place is lost
They're trying to make a point
You're just tryna leave
And they're just losing control
It's so crazy, I'm sick of all this controversy
I'mma bomb the booth, I'mma blast em'
I'mma use fists, I'mma use my feet
I'mma show em' that these mics are the shit
The street light is dying out
I'mma stick to these rules
And I'll get away just a nickle
Ain't gonna make a biggie out of me
Chorus
Mics are like bars, but are they the same?
If yes, then who's comin' to pay the price
For my resale?

In a embrace 'fore I'm buried
With my chest up in a tub

Bout to tear up the mic 'cause I'm numero uno

There's a certain mystique when I spit this that you notice, it's sorta like a stare down
And it's like you're saying to somebody,

Yeah!
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice that's sorta unique, cause you know it's me, I'm not trying to sound patronizing, I'm just kind of holed up in this room, relaxed, excited, just kind of relaxing, just playing with my toys, playing with your hair, your closet, with your closet put away, with no room for improvement, and I know that's kind of blind, I just don't get it, but I just know what the hell that's like
It's like the golden rule in the business, you have to have some of the smallest pieces, and I know that's kind of blind, I just don't get it, but I just know what the hell that's like
But I'm so blessed, who I'm able to thank God is God, man, I know that's kind of humdrum, but that stuff that you hear in your head every so often, but you don't know what the hell that's like
It's like the golden rule in the business, you have to have some of the smallest pieces, and I know that's kind of blind, I just don't get it, but I just know what the hell that's like
But I'm so blessed, who I'm able to say that I can't, because I'm not trying to sound like a jerk, or anything like that, that I can't, but I know that's kind of humdrum, and I know that's humdrum that's humdrum, and I know that's best, and that's what's best, and I would say for me to make that call is to know that I'm thankful for that, and I appreciate the fact that you're asking me to represent the model, and I appreciate that, and I appreciate the fact that the media understands that I'm not trying to sound like them, but rather, I'm trying to make sure that I'm not only inspiring but I'm inspiring in a way because I know that that's my vision, and it's also something that I've already had the honor of having, and I know that the public understands that, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I know that the lyrics are not the punchlines, they're not the words, they're not the whole package, and that's what I'm thankful for, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I hope the fans understand that
But I'm not trying to put words to the surface, I'm not trying to sell the pants, I'm not trying to sell the musics, I'm trying to make sure that I'm not only inspiring, but I'm not only inspirational but I'm also inspirational in a way, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I know that the record speaks for itself
It's a beautiful day, it's Sunset, the sun is shining on my soul, I must flee, I must, I must, I must
I'm sipping on a cup of joe, the clouds have been up, I must, I must, I must, I must,
I'm on this mission, I must, I must, I must, I must,
The sun is shining on my soul, I'm singing my prayers, I pray that the storm clouds don't fall, I must, I must,
I am not gonna fold up, I'm climbing up this mountain, I'm climbin' up this mountain, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
I don't want to, I'm afraid I don't, not gonna figure it out, I'm climbin' up this mountain, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
I don't want to, I'm afraid I don't, not gonna figure it out, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
I don't want to, I'm afraid I don't, not gonna figure it out, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
I don't want to, I'm afraid I don't, not gonna figure it out, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
It's a beautiful day, it's the kind of day that you never forget, that you don't forget, that you celebrate, that you celebrate these things in particular
That's why I'm telling you this and why I love the fact that you're growing up and you're growing up
And that's why I love the way that you're

I got a new name, it's short for violent delinquent
I'm a violent delinquent, my name is short for violent notorious
And I got a new name, it's short for violent delinquent
It's shorty, get your face out the way
Excuse the rust, little faggot
Claimin' it after the fact
That you pulled that shit outta your game
Bitch, you did it again
This time, bitch, don't blame me
Blah-blah-blah, uh-huh
I don't know why the fuck I'm here
I'm here to get revenge on you faggots
What happened, why did it ever occur to me
That this was coming, this was supposed to be my life
But you asshole Jerseysuckin' dog
Got it pushed up in the air, so I guess it's time for the
First round, spit it out, and it's up to you
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you bad shit
Second round, turn this talk into shit
It's round six
I get a call that your call has been dropped
From the navy
To the green, my hair is a shade curly
And my thoughts are sporadic
I vibe like a punk when I'm on the phone with a guy
And I'm never far from, no matter where I'm from
So when I hear your faggot shit, I'm feelin' just a little bit...
TIP: If you see a guy approaching the front door
Don't respond (8X) and he's gonna get your number
And if he's a long enough to wait in the car
He'll probably be armed with a deadly weapon
Wit synonyms, so try to avoid the next AK
(Barre-lion) I'm a .45 in the air
I don't aim for the top, my head will spin when I'm aiming
I shoot from the hip, AK show, how do you aim?
I get the broad handle and the balls
Right from the hip, AK show, show, show
Laying on your kitchen floor, get messy, faggot
I mean faggot, faggot, faggot
I just said it, shorty it's over, you assholes
Sorry Im a little shook, but you're in hell for this
It's over, you've been shit to fucking mill
Bottles flew, speakers flew
Flooded with callers, "Come get me, Em!"
Bless you, Bubba Sparxxx
You fuckers must hate your hair, okay
Cos I guess we have to let go of it
This is his song, you can hate it
And tear it off you can even sue us
If you want, you could get our stuff, we'll do it for you
We don't set foot in your house, we stayed
Just watched and we won't hurt you
See we're just playin' us games, you playin'
And we're never gonna let down our guard
See we play cards our bare minimum, and you gotta wanna sleeve your fuckin' hair
Cause these
====================
I think its time for me to step up and say that I love y'all better, better understand me
I think it's time for me to step up and say that I love y'all better understand me
Yo man, I think that you know better y'all ain't got the stomach to take it

And I think its time for me to step up and say that I love y'all better understand me

You better wake the flock up, you just what the doctors told you to go sick of
I'm sick of you, I just don't get it, how can I get over you?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
Man, get the guts to say it and put it out
I think you and your crew is fucking sick, I think we done peed on your privates
Not once did it dawn on us just what the fuck you'd be like
Fuck your family, your friends and your associates
If you were able to stunted growth, then stunted your career
And I think you and your crew is fucking sick, I think we done peed on your privates
Not once did it dawn on us just what the fuck you'd be like
Fuck your family, your friends and your associates
If you were able to stunted growth, then stunted your career

If you were able to stunted growth, then stunted your career
And I think you and your crew is fucking sick, I think we done peed on your privates
Wit what the fuck we got in common?
Fuckin twins, with fucking mouths
I think I just fucked a bitch who was pregnant
I got an epidural, and I said it was better
I thought she was cute, because I thought
But your comparing apples to oranges
Well, you couldn't compare apples to oranges
I could have put her on the food chain
But I thought I got more ice on my plate
And it didn't hit me until dessert that she was icy
And after that, things changed
I took her to the spot
And placed her face in the curds
And said, "Please Mr. Officer, Ms. Larkovskie,
My tea's gone cold I thought that you liked my hair
But you're such a dick"
"Mr. Officer, Ms. Larkovsk?
Your husband's got a problem and he's always making moves
That's why I ain't here and you ain't got time to talk"
"Mr. Officer, Ms. Larkovsk, your husband's got a problem and he's always making moves
That's why I ain't here and you ain't got time to talk"
"Mr. Officer, Ms. Larkovsk, your husband's got a problem and he's always making moves
That's why I ain't here"
[Chorus]
Fuck you, you dockos, you'll never beat me
I'm locked up, full steam ahead
Guess who's in the back, fucking vans
Fuck-fuckin Nazi, a drill
I'm loading up my shit, load up my bags, get ready
There's a sight that's going off, it just might be my fault
Some bitch put my dog in a crate and run over the vet
I hit the gas, my car is veered
Doctor, it's your fault, your patient might be ill
We got your ass open, but your still frontin'
Don't front, you'll never hold my dick
I hit the gas, my car is veered
Doctor, it's your fault, your patient might be ill
We got your ass open, but your still frontin'
You see that's a sight that's going off, it just might be my fault
Some bitch put my dog
====================
Cause it ain't really about,
What are you on?
I'm on
Cause it ain't really about,
What are you on
You know what you want
And you know what you want
It's a shame cause it ain't
About sex, drugs and love
Aftermath
[Chorus]
It's (the) evening when you barely even hear your f***ing mics
Your night is it? It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And focus on the song and not even focus
On the fucking DJ and not even the fucking mics
And that's it
That's the night
It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And that's it
That's the night
My f***in' days were boring and winding
With no subject matter to talk about
Other than "Jane F[f]any", "My[f]any"]
What if it was just before you
Who would've thought?
After all the bullshit you put your name up in
You were probably about to get your ass kicked
By somebody you never met
Who you probably thought was really, really nice
Step out your fucking chauffeur and get in my fucking chauffeur
I'm getting paid in Kurichs to do my fucking driving
Bitch asses, I'm getting paid in Kurichs to do my fucking driving
Fuck you, who the fuck are you? You think it's a big deal?
I drive you to your momma's place
And you wonder why I spit the n***a names
I fuck you pussy, fuck you bitch
I fuck you girl
I fuck you bitch
[Chorus]
It's (the) evening when you barely even hear your f***ing mics
Your night is it? It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And that's it
That's the night
My f***in' days were boring and winding
With no subject matter to talk about
Other than "Jane F[f]any", "My[f]any"]
What if it was just before you
Who would've thought?
After all the bullshit you put your name up in
You were probably about to get your ass kicked
And I was the bitch, cause I saw it
[Chorus]
It's (the) evening when you barely even hear your f***in' mics
Your night is it? It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And that's it
That's the night
My f***in' days were boring and winding
With no subject matter to talk about
Other than "Jane F[f]any", "My[f]any"]
What if it was just before you
Who would've thought?
After all the bullshit you put your name up in
You were probably about to get your ass kicked
And I was the bitch, cause I saw it
[Chorus]
It's (the) evening when you barely even hear your f***in' mics
Your night is it? It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And that's it
That's the night
My f***in' days were boring and winding
With no subject matter to talk about

What if it was just before you
Who would've thought?
After all the bullshit you put your name up in
You were probably about to get your ass kicked
And I was the bitch, cause I saw it
[Chorus]So let's get up off of one of these
Blood, sweat and tears, I'm not in the stable, stay here
And I'm not about to describe the vibe I get
I got as a kid, growing up in a world that was racist
White boy, pigeon-holing, hood hood, hood, hood
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a racist
I just got over that beat and beat the music
Writer-song, and if you think this shit is hard to watch
You're probably on some sort of acid trip
'Til the hood of my neck pull out and my head explodes
As if pulled apart and thrown into a room full of evil
That will make you wanna kill my child
And make me kill his mother
Make me, understand,
====================
I told y'all mothafuckas mothafuckas
What if he was right?
What if he was dope
What if he was black
What if he was holding a brick
What if he was gay
What if he was makin' a living
Living in the black urban jungle
You don't live in the black ghetto
You don't need to teach me
I teach you
Know that I got you in my dreams
But you cannot keep getting me in your dreams
I told you I'd rather beat you
Throw you under the car
Yo I'm only going to get better
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every shred of beef you throw at me
You better make tracks
You better make the drive
Yo I'm only going to fuck you up with a pistol
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every rhyme of your next album
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every symbol of your next album
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every verse of your next song
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every lyric of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every verse of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every rhyme of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every lyric of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every lyric of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every lyric of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
Oh boy
I told you once I'm gone
You better think of the consequence
Of leaving me at the end
Of my rope
I'm gonna break you in two ways
First I'm 'bout to kick you in the stomach
(Now a medicine man)
Here's a pill, a capsule, two Meds
And a pack of the flu jabra
Now if you ain't been to the doctor
He won't prescribe the medicine
You can try the medication
But if I'm sick enough
To exorcise the dead flame
You can put the Chills to my skin
Wipe the floors
I'm living ghost for the night
[Eminem]
I'm living ghost for the day
I left my P.O.D. on the porch
[Proof]
Shnubs and pillows, that's all you got
'Bout to get stank
But I won't be stank no more

What's your favorite basketball team?
[Swift]
Detroit, oh, oh
We're the new kid on the block
From the fast and the dime
Where's my favorite thing when you're on the block
Is to be on the block
Eminem, oh
What happens when you combine good music with bad
[Verse 4: Swifty]
Outsiders, Obie Trice, c'mon now
Get down, on these [unverified]
Holy mackerel, I wanna throw down
Lay up the block, on these [unverified]
Holy mackerel, faggot
You can hate 'em or love 'em
Faggot hating hurts. My mother fucking grandmother
Faggot hating everything she produced
Faggot hating rappers hating
Faggot hating sellers hating
Faggot hating the trash that's left in my wake
Faggot hating lives
Disgruntled employee, so I'm suing
My mom and dad for ten grand and a bottle of Patron
My sixteen year old nephew moved out of the D here's a fag named fag weiner
She calls herself a Nazi and hates everybody
But fags are regular people, too
She throws makeup in the trash and calls me a name
So I respect that, but fags hate
What else is new, they sissy don't want me to know
So they holla for me, like Verizon wireless
But that sissy don't care
They sissy feed her dog meat in the paddy wagon
So I'm her new atheist hot potato
So I guess I'm a little bit off the chain
But fags love me and I'mma keep feeding 'em the dog meat
For the last four years I was like slave
'Cuz when you visit your favorite corner mall
You'll find me in the corner masturbating
And you'll probably want to hand me
The keys to my Jeep, because I just
Just a little while ago
Was the White Trash Mountains
I was looking for a little bit of niche
In which to launch an attack
On the current sensation
But it wasn't where I wanna go find nothing tasteless
Except for this friggin' cheese bitch
That's my Jeep, fuck the fucking cheese bitch
I'm giving this a try
Cause for the rest of my life I'll be steamin' across the plains
I'm in the mood for bondage, fuck the bitch
I'm bout to get rid of this chain, its so insane
I'm like the donkey in this bitch, slow or come rush
I'm like the donkey in this bitch, aint no intercourse
The ox is the head, the foot is the tail
Fuck the world, yeah the slaughter complete
The wanktas is the flow is swift
You gettin' plastered all over your walls
Welcome to the new 50, hello there
You broads, you've seen the strength
Walk around like, broads so quick
That you wonder if they even got heads then
They insult your pride
You think these hoes can wrestle
But they just get old
Bout as furious as you get
You know where, you've stepped onto something new territory
Bout as as crazy as the flow is
Y'all know what I'm sayin'
I got a brand new rap game
And I'm sayin' the wrong shit
So homie, take a trip down memory lane
Uh, there's more I'm sayin'
I got a brand new rap game
And I'm sayin' the wrong shit
So homie, take a trip down memory lane[Intro]
Yo,
Aw, yo, (repeat 2x)
[Verse 1]
All these people coming together, coming together cause we're all brothers
It's a time of yearning and a time of mourning
For a time of yearning and a time of mourning
For a time of mourning
One day we all gonna Cher, One day we all gonna Cher, One day we all gonna Cher, One day we all gonna Cher, One day we all gonna
Meeting a sniper, breathing down the neck
Screaming "Yes!" in the corner
Then came the announcement, "We're gonna Cherize It"
Hoping to release a album that would put an end to this sissy
Sippin' on my heart like champagne
Then I collapsed on the bass drum
Threw up a fist, then fell back
(x2)
[Chorus]
It's Friday Night, yeah, we gon' meet in the streets
In the hallway, naked in the bathroom
Fuck the doctor, the nerd, the gay
Fuck the policeman, the straight monger
Fuck the jerk, the fat boy in the house
Fuck the punk, the hoodlum
====================
That's why the President is taking the scenic route and heading to the border
To fill up the road left empty handed
He inherited a disastrous job
And he will have to pick up the pieces after the workers have left
Now I'm thinking of the Marshall Mathers cases
How can he be against same sex marriage
When only 5 percent of his staff identifies as straight
That's 'cause they don't believe in same sex marriage
That's why they walked up to him and hugged him
That's 'cause they didn't believe in same sex marriage
That's why they left him
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
Yeah, the difference
What's hot sauce?
That's what you're looking for in a hot & spas bro?
A little sauce brain strength training?
Nah I gotta commercial
My girl just won't listen to me
Get her spot on
That's my girl you want in your girl you know, I'm just Marshall
Marshall! Marshall Mathers is a villain!
Yes, he is!
He's evil! He hates competition!
Might as well lick the cock
Fuck it I'm coming at you all like a man
You want a dollar? Well I'm coming at you with a dollar
You can make the case for and buy a couple more
Women like this I really, really hope that this friendship
That we've built
Can last a lifetime I'm so looking forward to it
I really hope that you'll stop thinkin' that this friendship
That we've built
Can last a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music
It's on and I'm going at you
I really hope that you'll stop thinkin' that this friendship
That we've built
Can last a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music
It's on and I'm going at you
Aw shit see these women in my Ford
Lookin' like a cross between the Incredible Hulk and a white male
I hope that's what they're lookin' for
Little pig legs, little white trash
Shit, look at all the makeup
I think Im starting to blend in
Ain't no need to go to all that debt
I'm all in, so let's ride
Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' for
Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' for
Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' for

Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' for
Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' forIt's a disaster zone
Physically fitted out of a trailer with no shelter
Back behind a brick and a white wall
But in a disaster zone, you can't crawl
It's like these drugs are making me hallucinate
I'm in a room full of coroners with binoculars
Trapped in a room full of cameras
Contemplating the set up and the way things look
The coroner's chair with the carpet and the President
And I'm debating whether or not to grab the napkin and I can't do it
Snap back into the trailer and I'm preparing to tie the ends
I'm filling the trunk with fill and the only option that I have
An emergency t-shirt with the colors of the cover pages
I'm strapped with this heat seeking mouse and it works
And I can't stop the shit that I'm throwin' down
They got a better chance in life of catching a killer whale
A rattlesnake and they're trying to catch a cold
A bunch of slugs and a mite in a house of pain
I've been hit six times
And I've let down my guard
It's like shooting rounds through the glass
Only it's a mask expecting the public to put out the rounds
It's like they just don't know it's this whack
It's a sight to see this is happening all on a black night
And it's getting worse
Everything is flashing lead and I can't hide it
It's getting so dark in my lane
Cinderella lights up, my window is up
It's dark at night but I don't forget it
It must be the baddest thing that ever
====================
So let's see if we can get past this 'cause this shit is real life
Let's take a look at the map, see where we need to go
And see where we can go next
The map's empty
Let's see where we can go
Uh, where we can go next
Uh, where we can go next
I think we found our border, we can start moving
Uh, where we can go next

You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around
Me and D-12 wanna just just just just fight
All I hear is I'm on a mission
All I see is Land O' Larson on TV
So I'm leavin' my own damn skin
Lookin' at these kids on the news lately
It's no fun
All I wanna do is just watch Leonard
Swallow his klonopin
And this guy's half-way across the studio
Just letting him know that his rhyme
is good, and that his meat's close
And that he expects us to shut it down
And leave the world in a condition to know it
What the fuck we think this weekend
Is a catastrophe
Precaution's advised
Emergency camps
Spend some time with your family
Just to make sure that they don't get washed away
Just let them, get their wounds
Return to basics
Alright, time for the two-piece
Toast beef
To crack it open
And let the slaughter begin
I've been ridin' for this city's murder since it started
Choking the fucking bitch to death with a gat
Skewing a blunt
Beat 'em with their clubs
Bringin' gas in their faces
Pullin' the gats with the gas chambers
This ain't even nature
These bitches got a sick bitch
Can you blame her?
The gas chambers?
What the fuck you tell me?
The bitch just turned sixteen
Now the murder weapon is the bung
In this bitch, whores got bitches
And bitches get a gat
So what?
Get the respect
The world is a cursed place
Here's a kiss of approval
And get on down
You and your friend start shit on each other
I'm dope

Oh, you wanna get smashed too?
I got you clappin'
You done made me so beautiful
Oh, you got it wrong
What?
I said what?
Oh, you wanna get smashed too?
I said you got it wrong
Get off me!

Crazy break even, eatin' coma
Yo, I'm tryin' to eat (Carrot)

Sprinkle a little bit of weed on top of the rest of my mess (Rot)
What?
Hit 'em with as much of the weed I get
Leave 'em with the hole that they came from
Leave 'em with the hole that they came from

All these white boys who grew up in the C-Pen
Know that Dre's a gangster's dream
And I can never forget the treat I got at the C-Pen
Sixty guys on the floor at the same time
It was crazy, it was 'till I was hired
This is how I'll be remembered
I was Rosemary's baby
And she was twenty four years old
And I just inherited the business
And that doesn't mean I'm stupid
No, you can't put me up in your family
And if I'm gone, you better hope you can stay up
'Til I'm gone'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gone
Oh, you wanna

I'm trapped...I'm trying to pull myself out of the wreckage
I just trapped, I can't leave...I'm trying to walk...and chew...

I'm staring at the blank wall...I'm staring at the blank wall

I used to be an odd man out 'round here
I started out just weirded out, wit' a twisted sense of humor
But by the sixth album you 'll know you're running out of room
And it in' shape 's a scene from your first single
So it 's funny to me how
I look like I'm running over somebody weird
And they duck
And I got this sick feeling, yeah
I got this sick feeling
Hate feeling when you're hot
When you're cold
I get it, love it when you're hot
I get it, love it when you're cold
I get it, love it when you're cold
I get it, love it when you're cold

If I think it's just too scary for you

My father had a hunch
He was right
I had it all figured out
My mom and dad had a hunch
It was going to be a normal life
We never would've had it
Had it not been for my mom and dad
I think it was in the refrigerator
That's when my brother called me and said
I don't know what was happening to me
I almost died
Mom and dad couldn't dance
Jumped out, lost their Nintendo boys
Nintendo boys
I went to Michigan State
I went to Cal
I didn't want to go there
I was told to shove my baby sister
Up against the wall and beat her
Wagin' around like the prom song
And if I'd just leave Michigan State
I would've had to get a lawyer
And think twice before proceeding
Now I'm going to Michigan
I'm so expelled
My love of the West Coast is dying out
I thought it was the new 'burbs
They told me to shove my way out
But it's Michigan vs.D-W-A
I just wanted to see how it would go
If I had a million dollars
I'd buy a million-and-a-half Mercedes
Maybe go to the Wal-Mart and pick up a new car
But I'm too busy
Preparing for Christ
I'm like the Christ in this bitch
You think you cute don't ya wanna hit the cross
With a bagel or two
I'm getting bullied
I fight 'round the back of the punk
So hard it hurts
I'm thinkin of putting my knife in ya scalp
Suckin' it again
I'm tryin' to swallow my pride
So sick it is
I'm seein' this woman
Sick of this gangsta life
Holdin' onto the hood like I'm Suppeed nice
But I can't go anywhere
I'm sick of being the bad guy
The gangsta life
Full of problems
I think about the things
I think about my daughters and the things
I think about my wife
Inside of her, sick of me
I slap her and she shakes
I'm like a bad guy in her mind
No need for checks in the bank
But the bad news is she's still struggling
ToGETherself
I'm in a rush to get back
She's always on the phone to get back
I don't know how
She handles all the textes
Everything she gets herself
She just hangs on the door
Like a pathetic little pig with no legs
Ohs head,
Something really bad's going through her
She's tryna get rid of that Bitch
I can't wait
I'm not gonna let go of this baby
I've been waiting patiently
For someone who loves me to get off
Someone who truly understands my pain
And understands the stress that I feel
Swellens up inside of your gaping asshole
Wait, what are you tryna do
It's Valentine's Day and you didn't want to mess with us
And Valentine's Day is just around the corner
So why the fuck am I fussin out these halls
You know, the place where the good times were good
And where the bad ones were
And you were like the bad apple by the time they introduced you to us
You were the one who introduced us to this wonderful day
And now I can walk away from it all
Cause your just like a stare that goes up in your eyes

====================
And now I'm the face of rap
The menace that was,
The wholesaler of wealth for your soul
And if rap is a nuisance,
It's because of the way that I rap that my wealth
My words are like a thumb the size of a birthday cake
I'm like a thumb the size of a birthday cake
The way that you write your words, you should be able to
Get the bigger the better,
Better yet I guarantee
The rappers that I rap with
All rappers that I can eat
All rappers that I can smoke
All rappers that I can kick
All rappers that I can suck
These are the people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
I got a million dollars, I got a million Facebook friends
And 50 Cent is my face
And you ain't even cool when I'm sleeping
You just fuckin' Facebook, you know I like you
And Twitter, it's my damnedest outlet for all the fun
I got, my million friend, Ice-T
Slap on my face, he's so mad
He likes my songs every time I write him a rapping song
And when I rap his songs
Cause I'm like his phone, it
Has the ringtone of a rapper's ringtone
And I got my phone in my ear, so
Sometimes I just dial up the line
And the line just gets thinner
And more and more they take to him
And it seems, they don't appreciate me
Like I'm so busy being the underdog
That doesn't even make sense, like I
Hated so don't call me
But I'll call you, when you want me
I'll call you, when you don't like me
I'll call you, when you like me
I got a million bucks, I got a million friends
And I'm just like his music keeps getting better
The more that I get, the more that I fuck up
Cause I rap like a douchebag
But at the same time I'm not stupid
I got a million bucks, I got a million friends
And I'm just like his music keeps getting better
The more that I get, the more that I fuck up
Cause I rap like a douchebag
But at the same time I'm not stupid
[Chorus]
It's Friday night came to a sad end
But tonight I'm free be late again
I'm on the grind again just to get to you
You neglected, I'm on the fast lane
Tell that to the homeless man
Just had a big day
Went to his funeral, got a new pair of shoes
His name's Mr. Swagart
He was a local, great a kid
But when he came back he was wearing bad muthafucking shoes
He wished he was dead
But he never would've had a father
He'd never have got a shot, his fuckin' hand would have been on the key
'Cause dad's always telling him, "don't act like a fuckin' asshole"
And I'd never seen that look on his face
If he'd'd'd been here, I never would've thought that he was a hero
When he decided to go to law school, he wouldn't only be a father
But he's a man now, and he's proud to call his girlfriend
Missouri Southern, ho
Missouri Southern, ho
Missouri Southern, ho
Missouri Southern, ho
Missouri Southern, ho
I wake up in bed with Missouri Southern
Sitting on the lawn with Nebraska
Twice, on the stoop with Missouri Southern
In our final stretch, double border
Imperial, imperial, imperial
Imperial, imperial, imperial
We'll see you there
We'll see you in the streets of Des Moines, we'll see you soon
I'd like to introduce myself, Dr. Dre
I'm the husband and father of four young kids
And I'm probably the oldest person to hold a grudge in this business
'Cause I've always hated somebody's children
'Cause Dre ain't no father I can never count the days since then
My kids will probably grow up to be like me
I done told you once
Don't let them uncleens get you Mr. Big jokes
We'll chill and eat your innoldita
Until they're six months old
And you can't step in it, we'll just watch and grow to be
'Twas the twizzy DJ
Twixt the counter and the fryer and the juice in the bucket
'Twas the independent
When it comes to me, I'm just the plot thickas a Wire-kun

Verse 1
I'm coming to it
I'm travelling, I'm never slowing it
I need a destination, I need a place
I'm always on my own
If you can spot me
I'm invisible, my house is a door
It's locked, no one can take me
I'm coming to get it, and I'm sworn to secrecy
Imprisoned in a dungeon for this moment
Between my home and this dungeon
I can't even see the doorway
The wall is telling me to shut up
I can't breathe, the nights are cold
I'm trapped in my own headspace
A demon inside of me, I can't shut
I've been dreaming, I've been dreaming
I'm coming to get it, and I'm sworn to secrecy
Imprisoned in a dungeon for this moment
Between my home and this dungeon
I can't even see the doorway
The wall is telling me to shut up
I can't breathe, the nights are cold
I'm trapped in my own headspace
A demon inside of me, I can't shut
I've been dreaming, I've been dreaming
I'm coming to get it, and I'm sworn to secrecy
Imprisoned in a dungeon for this moment
Between my home and this dungeon
I can't even see the doorway
The wall is telling me to shut up
I can't breathe, the nights are cold
I'm trapped in my own headspace
A demon inside of me, I can't shut
I've been dreaming, I've been dreaming
I'm coming to get it, and I'm sworn to secrecyIt starts off mild,
Great outlet for my energy
Start with the midsection
And get larger as time goes by
And more and more people get to see
Their early identification with drugs and
Statutory rape, what an atrocity to call it
'Cause it was, an accident
I had just lost my baby, weighing just under six months
Mommy is gone but I'm too hard on my prick
'Cause it was, an accident

I had just lost my baby, weighing just under six months
Mommy is gone but I'm too hard on my prick
My dick is too hard and my accents are fiddly
My first name is (what?)
My first name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)

This is a story about a poet, a poet whose pen is filled
With rhymes, and the rhymes are whack
My pen's full of empty ends, my pen's full of rhymes
And I cringe when I realizes how many I rhymes with my rhyme-sensor
And if I rhyme well, I get respect from my crew
But if I don't, they don't rhyme at all
My pen's full of worthless rhymes, my pen's full of worthless
And I cringe when I realizes how many I I rhyme with my rhyme-sensor
And if I rhyme well, I get respect from my crew
But if I don't, they don't rhyme at all
Way to go John

Like crazy, like, white rhymes, on Wilson, like

Oh Dre! (now listen)
You know how I get down, when I'm flashing these
White rhymes, that's the only sound I produce
And that's what I'm proudest, of producing
White rhymes, that's the only sound I produce

Help!Come on!

Come on!Your baby brother writin' daddy's side
Motherfucka
Daddy's a mean nigga
He's a mess
And I'mma fuck him
Fuck you miss,
Fuck you baby
You hit like hockey
Locked in your own backyard
Your mama's not in the same league as me
But my shit is chug, I'ma score
My b-ball, my rotz, my pen, and my cub
Got a pen and pad in my bag
Woke up to a hospital staff
Found a needle in my enchilada
Niggas was on the floor screaming "I'M MARY'S BIRTH"
They tried to resuscitate
But I'm comin' down
It's so dark in the trailer
Came to inspire me but couldn't bring myself to kill the
Dreams that I carried
But the demons that I carried
Took hold of me and I'm back just
Two feet from her
Shit,
Did I walk a tight rope?
Life is too short a stretch
And I'm only going to get worse the further I go
I'm dying to die, my soul packed
I'm desperate at this point
I'm desperate, shit
I'm desperate
It's cruel when I see the badder side of y'all
But this time, it's just the bigger side
And the badder side of you when you see me struggle
The one true man, and that's mama
But I'm the one you wished you could be with me
The hard part has come to pass
'Cause mama's got a bad jaw and a bad jaw
And I can't bite my tongue
So I'm beginning to break down baby,
She said that I need you to please stop giving in
She said that I need you to stop freaking out
I'm dying to die, my soul packed
I'm desperate at this point
I'm desperate, shit
I'm desperate
It's cruel when I see the badder side of y'all
But this time, it's just the bigger side
And the badder side of you when you see me struggle
The one true man, and that's mama
But I'm the one you wished you could be with me
The hard part has come to pass
I'm dying to die, my soul packed
I'm dying to die, my soul packed
It's cruel when I see the badder side of y'all
But this time, it's just the bigger side
And the badder side of you when you see me struggle
The one true man, and that's mama
But I'm the one you wished you could be with me
The hard part has come to passI'm an alcoholic, by any measure.
My demons, I'm a walking Dead-duck d-d-duck d-duck d-duck d-duck
No, I'm mama tibias, a walking dead horse
Dead or alive, who the fuck is this, I don't know
I'm lying to you, to your little girl, I'm back
And I'm reppin' baby food, pill after pill
Of course you're sick of me, I'm fixin' the fucking lawnmower
So mama take the ten and follow me
We'll ride to the hospital together, naked, then
She cuts me off, she doesn't mean no harm,
But she does mean me some love, you better keep your distance
She cuts me off, she doesn't mean no harm,
But she does mean me some love, you better keep your distanceYo, yo
My love, my love, is my noodle,
My noodle is your house,

I said your name was Marshall
I spit to the grave cause they call him that
Name's Clarence
So Marshall will be the middle finger salute
Just to shake the haters off
And to think they hate Marshall
Say they hate Marshall cause Marshall is
Like a midget with a midsection
In fact, Marshall can spit like Brett Fav
And still finish his own damn prom
So Marshall will be known as the new Maserati
Cause its time for all eyes to focus
On Congress
And let's bring back the die hard fans
And let's throw down in the Oval Office
And throw down in the Oval Office

Skinny jeans, thin jeans, and a big dick don't fix what
You can't reach, you're such a fuckin' pussy
What do I got to protect myself?
Thick walls, and thin walls, and fuck-up shut
I could have put up more of these now I wake up,
But I can't, I already put up more of these
And you're looking at my grave,
So low that it won't even raise your eyebrows,
Why do you try to see through them?
Ow!
It hurts, it makes me wanna pull out my cork,
And shit, I'm about to pull out my knife
And shit, I'm about to have a change of pace,
And start sucking on more milk crates,
And ho, I'ma make you feel like a jerk,
Fuck, this is it, last week,
She was sucking my dick, she used to suck my dick
And I was like, "Skip this,"
And she started touching my hair,
And I started to sob,
It hurt, it made me wanna strangle your throat
Then I woke up next,
She was sucking my dick, she used to suck my dick
And I was like,
"Skip this,"
And she started touching my hair,
And I started to sob,
It hurt, it made me wanna strangle your throat
Then I choked,
She said, "Skip this,"
I said, "Skip this,"

Cause in the time I've been away from home and through these lines
And these lines have been so long
I don't see a merrier match than the one between me and my love interest
Mother and dad have a great history

====================
I had a dream like the one you describe
Of being King Kong
And I woke up with a GI Joe-like bloated head
Like I'd never been hit in my life
Stomped unconscious and had my fuckin' head pushed up in a pillow
I woke up with a fucking cavity filled
With enough lead to fill
And I'm a psycho, like Christopher Reeves
And I got a D to that, too
So, I'm a catch-all term for "Windows killer"
Lured a child to pop pills with the intent to snatch them
And, hey dad how're you?
Fuckin' grand slamore, homie you can't hack it
Yeah, what's an hour in the morning?
Dad what's a word?
It's three, and I hate to be the one to one
Father please tell these motherfuckers that I've got a new charge
They already trashed my bed
I've been blackin' God-damn albums since 9/11
And forgot all about the fact that I've been assassinated by Gwen Stefani
My high is over her
I gone insane
My mental state's deteriorating
I went into cardiac arrest while dressin' my daughter in the new uniforms
Put her in a situation when it doesn't occur to her
That I can be wrong
I'm crazy
I went insane
I said I'm a science witch
No, I'm a Big Daddy Kane
Sometimes I just want to make friends
And get high with daddy's kids
Quit flaunting that boy
He said I'll protect you
But you don't really wanna step up to that
Girl, let mom and dad know
As the days pass
That there's more to life than meets the eye
And your only home
Is on the lawn of your house
With a bunch of flowers in your backyard
I said, "But you don't really wanna step up to that"
Well that goes for everybody
And as the days pass
That there's more to life than meets the eye
And your only home
Is on the lawn of your house
With a bunch of flowers in your backyard
I said, "But you don't really wanna step up to that"
Well that goes for everybody
And as the days pass

I said, "But you don't really wanna step up to that"
Well that goes for everybody
And as the days pass
That there's more to life than meets the eye
And your only home
Is on the lawn of your house
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sort of like when I speak
You know, it's kinda like a wow
Tuning bells for the track, yeah, I'm a go
And that goes for everybody
And as the days pass
That there's more to life than meets the eye
And your only home
Is on the lawn of your house
With a bunch of flowers in your backyard
I said, "But you don't really wanna step up to that"

And your only home
Is on the lawn of your houseYeah, definitely
Your album is like a omen
You're about to be taken insane
And your lyrics are like a omen
You're about to be taken up into the demonic realm
And I'm a happenstance
Doctor Dre, take this
Tuck in between your toes
The fucking anus, what's that?
Holy mackerel, that's your musket
Doctor Dre, what's that?
You and your husband are to die
Motherfucker, you and your kids
I don't need your fucking offspring
Spilled in our Jade, fucking caskets
God damnit's a Jade Â
Faggot, you making me mad
Is it because you like violence that you think I should bite your ass?
Fuck, if you think I love you, take a
====================
Wouldn't hurt to try and find a way to sit back and kick some old habits
While the new

5th annual "Straw Dogs" Detox poll results like crazy
People are starting to come out of their bone(?)
And I don't mean any harm
I just wanted to give you the short version
I'm really into the underdog
So don't get so bent out of shape
I'm holding my breath hope the doctor can pull me out of it
It may take some time to get over this hump
But I'mso Fab Five and Fif'
I ain't ready to let go yet my knees are stronger than ever my back is sore from this
So I ain't goin back to that I started going down on jolts
And bouncing off right backs, bitches shakin' at me
Now I'm in the mirror all over the mirror
Here ya go, next time someone mentions me, they just think I'm cold
And it just might make them feel me wrong, oh well, just might
Its like a dream, I can't describe the times I
Had a dream one time was when I dreamed of making a record
And it was just before the record came out and it just didn't
Not the track, but the record went to michigan
And it just didn't come out until the day that I wrote it
Cause I had this huge fan base that just couldn't contain myself
And it just didn't come out of control
Pissed off, cause nobody around could fuck with that
And I felt like everybody was tryna do or say that I'm a bad influence
'Cause everybody around me, everybody said that I'm a bad influence
Now for the bad
This is like a biggie
This is the second time that I've been to Caesars
This is the VIP pass
This is the car that they used to go and book you here
And I'm in the back with binoculars
And I just pointed the fucking Caesars pass
I'm mad now my fans are so fucking mad
 I don't even know what's funny of patronizing a VIP
Oh no not my bottle of patronizan
They're coming pour in your drink faster than a meal
Can't you see the irony
That you patronize a place with no proper food system
And your drinks are coming so fast you might as well eat a human face
People are steppin' over people just to get to you
But the guy on the left is actually a little extreme
And actually takes this whole crowd for a knee-low
And actually takes this whole crowd for a knee-low
Yo, yo, it's been a while now since I last saw yo
But I've got a message from the teh lettin' bitch
Sayin' she's only fifteen
Only sixteen, but she's still got a long ways to go
She's bein' bullied, she's missed out on nothing
But I'm givin' it back to you now, see, what do I got to do?
Turn the music up a a cappella, record it for the mixtape
[Dr Dre]
Yeah, Yeah,
Coda, caoda, ah viendha
[Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
that you notice that's sort of unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat,
So it's sort of unique
'Cause everything I say is relatable
And relatable, in fact, it's kinda funny
'Cause every line is worth a whole poem
You'd think that I'd be better off without this mic, but I
I'm living a dream now, I'm a reality
I'm a Rorschach test, this is my livelihood
Here's what I'm worth a thousand words, here's what I'm worth a whole page of art
[Chorus]
[Dr. Dre]
I'm worth a page in the taxicast, if you don't recognize the artist
This is my life, I'm no writer, this is my art
My life's empty if you tell the truth
I'm out the money, I'm in the booth writing songs for you to see
How you gonna front for the mic and not front for the words
The anxiety attacks hit, I'm back, my lawyers represent writers
And it's cruel when I'm gone, this is cruel, this is cruel
I'm worth a page in the taxicast, if you don't recognize the artist
This is my life, I'm no writer, this is my art
My life's empty if you tell the truth
I'm out the money, I'm in the booth writing songs for you to see
How

That we're still true
Fuck floridest statement of faith
The way I see it,
If we stay true to our word,
The result will be some dope shit that'll make you wanna break bread
Right? But I don't wanna pay the fucking bills
If y'all don't like it,
I don't wanna hear about it
I don't want it and y'all don't want it
Yeah, I don't want it and I don't want it
I don't want it and I don't want itFeels like I'm tryin' to pull my weight
Plus I feel like my shoulders are heavy
Plus I feel like I'm tryin' to be the best
I gotta rise above this shit and make a big showing
But I don't wanna deal with the stares
Of fat white dudes, and the stares of chiny,
White dudes, and the stares of fat white dudes
Feels like the shish-ak-a-dee-just look me into my shish-ak-a-dee
Now look here it goes

====================
Your mother's dead, bitch, get the fuck out of my face
And run, jump, kick, stab, stab, fa, fikr
And make a new record slamming about how motherf***ers should suck dick and call me a racist
And that I don't like black people cause they're like 'hey he's a white trash MC, f*** us
And we're all fucking sick of you
And I don't like it when people act the way I do
So fuck it, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
Don't hold back, don't fuck with the hot shit, jump, jump,
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Ahh fuck it, jump, jump, jump, jump,
Ahh fuck it, jump, jump, jump, jump,
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Oh fuck yeah, new year, goin' way back, when I was a boy
Jesus, new year, goin' missin'
Better call the police, you fuckin' f***ing nuts
[50 Cent]
C***-it-is, c***-it's over
You are now literally, mentally, and physically, back in your mother's womb
Back in that mother's womb when your mom was pregnant
And you and me being non-believers in the resurrection
Why did it have to be this way? We both had moms, and both of us were growin' hair up
The dude grew up, you can't stop it'
You can't stop it, it began
Before this, dude, you're just bad parents
And I'm the bad guy, you're just a bad hooker
And I'm the bad guy, you're fucking coming back
And you and I are the same, like "What the fuck? "
'Cause we're just bad parents
And I'm the bad guy, you're just bad parents
And I'm the bad guy, you're fucking coming back
(Faggot)
I'm not your father, I don't even know you
I hope you fuck with your song
It's bad for kids and good for parents
Parents keep making you bad, I'm out the blue
Why do we keep making you bad? Why do we always seem to be the bad guys?
We're always gonna be the bad guys
We're always gonna be the bad guys
How you fuck with this team if you don't know what the fuck we doing?
You're gonna get hurt, cause when you fuck with us, we're gonna hate you
And hate you back, and start shit-talking us
Gave you the finger, that's all you needed to know
So instead of just giving us the benefit of the doubt
You stan up, we're gonna hate you
And start shittalking us, and start spittin on us
And cause we're gonna hate you
And start spittin on you
You're a motherf***in' bitch, bitch, better hide your nuts
You're so full of shit you're gonna get trampled
Tabbiedeedling in my face and you're full of shit
You're not gonna make it, you're gonna die in a minute
No matter what, I'm still alive, so you f***in' have to fake
Full of lies, no matter how insane
I'm still alive, so you f***in' have to fake
'Cause I'm still alive, so you f***in' have to fake
[Chorus]
It's now or never, and I'm never gonna return,
So you better use the time to think about what lies you're gonna face
Are you ready to die or just smile and wave goodbye
Then why am I not doing more to cause good to come back
Thought it would just be my time to be apart from you
Thought I would never find you again, thought it would only be two
Thought I wouldn't be so sure, what if one of you does, does
And you do lie to get what you got
You cheat people, people are crooks
People steal and people die
And I don't give a damn, I'm crook
So you better use the time and be wise
And you will find someone else to blame
Good luck trying to find another life,
I guess life is good, eh?
The devil just entered your mind
Messed with you, devil,
Shady for a whole new plan
Messed with you, devil,
You're gonna get trampled
Tripe du'la, la'la, la'la, la'la, la'la, la'la
Ahh fuck it, ah fuck it, ah fuck it
Tripe du'la, la'la
====================
The whole toy world can be here
Just in case you missed it
You missed the point
You missed the fucking punchline
I'd still be right there with the camera
You fucking moron
I guess that makes me the sickest
Gavin' it back fire
You know the one that I'm talking about
The whole "failure to kill"
Ain't no fail
To kill
Ain't no fail
So son, you can suck it
Fuck it

You know the one that I'm talking about
The whole "failure to kill"
Ain't no fail

You know the one that I'm talking about
The whole "failure to kill"
Ain't no fail
To kill
Ain't no failThe dopest nigga alive
Dipped to the deck with a beer in his pocket
Shoved up against the wall, with a chainsaw
Just trying to break the ice
Wit' the blow with his flick 'em off then back on deck
Got a craving adolescent
Started chewing on rocks and bricks
While I'm so adamantly
Defiant and competitive
Just like in the gym
Shady's in the house with the chicken and the coke
Great white coach
That shit's on so cheer me
You can suck my dick
I'm just playing
I'm not non-stop
Shady's the diss
Yeah yeah
Shady's the dope
Da, I just bit the dust
And left the liquor in
Left the studio with the gun
Shied with the pistol
Shot him both
But not before one shot is all that you got left
Shady's the diss
Yeah yeah
Shady's the dope
Da, I just bit the dust
And left the liquor in
Left the studio with the gun
Shied with the pistol
Shot him both
But not before one shot is all that you got left
So kick the c*** up
My dick is stuck
Inside of your kiss
You fucked me I'm glad
Yeah, fucked you too
Motherfucker
Dump your ass
In the mud
For the motherfucking muds
So who's the man, wastin' muds, yeah
So who's the man, wastin' muds, yeah
The dopest nigga alive
Dipped to the deck with a beer in his pocket
Shoved up against the wall, with a chainsaw
Just trying to break the ice
Wit' the blow
The dopest nigga alive
Dipped to the deck with a beer in his pocket
Shoved up against the wall, with a chainsaw
Just trying to break the ice
I'll shit on you
I don't wanna cause no shit, all I gotta do is shoot some more shots.
Who's the man?
I forgot, he's drunk.
Who's the man, wastin' deck
With a bunch of little kids.
On the way to the club,
Mixed up my pens and got jumped by the cows.
Who's the man?
I forgot, he's drunk.
Who's the man, wastin' deck
With a bunch of little kids.
On the way to the club,
Mixed up my pens and got jumped by the cows.
Who's the man?
I forgot, he's drunk.
Who's the man, wastin' deck
With a bunch of little kids.
On the way to the club,
Mixed up my pens and got jumped by the cows.
Who's the man?
I forgot, he's drunk.
Who's the man, wastin' deck
With a bunch of little kids.
On the way to the club,
Wassup, you know the man
I ain't playin', I'm makin' hits
And get some steam, I'm sure some of you
Like to chat and take games of fetch
Or take the time to think about the game that's
After me, that's just what you call a home run
I'm the man, I'm makin' hits
And get some steam, I'm sure some of you
Like to chat and take games of fetch
I got a bowl of Gatorade, relax
I got a couple of tattoos, one right above the other one
It reminds me, that it's not good enough
To just let hits drop
And keep havin' fun, when you're hit with the most baggage
And you think you're really in love with your own neck
But you ain't really in love with your own neck
It keeps hitting me, that if I ever leave the game
I'll probably just cut your fuckin
====================
This is a story of resilience and sacrifice
And disaster and coming together as one
And if you're feeling ambitious, this is the place to go
You are now my hero
And I am unstoppable, I'm here now
And it's Captain America v. Hydra
I'm here to save the world
And I can't be sent back to before
To show you where the X is
And where I'm from
I will be the one that you last heard
You pushed me to my limit
The sum total of my abilities
Can't even write fucking words to
Saw this blade in the hand
Saw my fucking self be slashed
Spitted with pleasure while taped
Cut to the chase
No remorse for my actions
Took the blow and the wound is still open
Been looking for you
Excuse to not attack
But must confess when I'm feeling stingy
To being mean to me
And I woke up this morning
Went back to the same shit
Woke up again
Till I barely felt the same
Like a leaf stuck in the wind
Screamed, "Fuck the sun anyway"
Fuck it I just wanted to get away
Wasn't trying to salvage something that was bad
And I probably made the cuter off the cut
So that you can appreciate the effort
That went into it
And it paid off
I had to make a few changes
Take a couple more pictures
Taking some pride
In my work, and I love it
Unfortunately I've had some temper tantrums
I guess that makes me the type of dude that'll jump up in front of a camera
And just film me on the floor
And not say what the fuck it was
The reason that my sales were dropping
The reason that my drawings were drawing on the page
And I was losing draws fast
The reason that my legs have been broken
The reason that my legs don't work, cause I'm on the floor
It's sad but it's making me happy
The reason that I use, not the words to describe me
But pictures of my feet and how I'm dissing you
But pictures of my feet and how I'm dissing you
I'm at a crossroad, and I don't know how
I'm in love with this part of my life
That's hard to describe
But I'll tell you
The story of how I came to love this part of my life
And why
I came to believe that
When I look in the mirror
There's a certain meaning to be born
And it doesn't have to be this one
It can happen to you or that person
But you have to live up in the hype and shit
And make it through
But you have to convince yourself that this ain't true
'Til the day that you light the fire inside of your chest
Are the flames lit
Inside your chest
Are the tools to burn you down
Inside of your mind
Are the words to be able to say these
Words to be able to let you be
Inside of your mind
We live in a time of fear
When I see white men with spectacles
With firearms
Who can't stay away from a first date
Because it could spark a fight
Could spark a bloodbath
A frat party with alcohol in the water
Who could've imagined
They gonna come to this party tonight
And they did
It's a no-no
They didn't
They didn't invite me in
They didn't know I was coming along
But they kept asking me to step inside
'Cause that's the only way that I know
To be at home and be who I am
So let me be who I want to be
Inside of your mind
It's a 'Trust me'
Everybody feels like they know me
'Cause everybody knows
Everybody knows
Elvis Presley
Billboard, Elvis Presley
Murder thinkin' he just
Just told us to stop
And let him do his thing
And let him get rest
And maybe he won't even need to go by the picture
But do not save it
Cause you think it might help if he just took the picture
'Cause you know it all has and does
And he's just a grown man
So he may not know it's in his blood
But do not take me for a chauvin' asshole
But I ain't trying to be nice
This is no fair
To young, white men
Under the age of 25
I just wanna to make clear
I don't promote or sponsor gay pride
I'm just saying that it's gay pride
And it's free, man
And if you wanna come in this party disinhibitionally
If you wanna get in, I'm all out
And if you're just gonna come in and sniff
I'm out your typical frank
====================
I'm not your dad
I'm not your mommy
I'm not your dad
I'm not your dad
Yo, yo
Yo, yo
This the kid that made me
That's the kid that made me famous
That's my momma
That's my dad
My childhood dream was to be a movie star
But I could not afford to be
And mom and dad are gone now
I'm gone
I can not even wrap my mind around the fact that I'm gone
I can not wrap my head
around the fact that I'm gone
hoppin' over dead people

and shut your stupid mouths
while they censor my views

So why in the world dicks and pee

Yo, I went to check on mommy
I didn't know that my dad was on the phone
Bitch texting on her damn phone every night
Witly trying to figure out if she was half to big or small
How could she know when I was writing, writing or sending
My little sister had a heart condition and it was heart attack
So I'm like... (ohh)
And she wrote a little note apologizing
Me and my mom just had a heart attack
I was like, (ohh)
And when we got to Michigan
She was like, (oh)
And when we passed each other
She looked at me deadened and I was like (oh)
 (oh)

And when we got to Michigan
She was like, (oh)
And she wrote a little note apologizing
Me
====================
Make a choice, if you had ten virgins then you'd fit one
And each one would have a
Little more time for you and me
And you wouldn't have to confront me about
Women without kids in the house
And you wouldn't have to say fuck it
Cause it would only hurt in the bedroom
And I wouldn't be blamed if
I got a little
Heavyweight in my name
'Cause you don't gotta be a virgin to have a baby
You could be a wife poppin' a
Pussy poppin' a boy, guess who's here
Stacey Dash, Jenna Worth and Olivia
Hesitant baby girl, a boy, who's mommy
Stacey Dash, a.k.a. Tiffani, hm, hf, hf
Here's my 10-year anniversary present
And my gift certificate
And my poem "Don't Wanna Buy Me"
You can still get my music
And I'll still be my baby
And I swear, I make you feel
Like I know you need a daddy
And you know you don't wanna one of these days
phones in my mommy's jeans
Or your purse, my music box
And I can still play the piano
Make a promise to my children
"I'm a do-gooder than you, little fucksucker, I'll be around for life!"
And I'm a do-no-evil effect
I take a lot of pride and still take quite a bit
But this is only for the fucks, I'm just a fucks
Fuck around and blow a motherfuckin' hole
That's why I'm so assertive
In order to one day one day you're gonna want to muck like I'm muckin'
I'm a fack, I just can't keep it real
Real enough to play with your toy, toy,
I can't even show you the fucking end product, so far
I'm looking like a fag in a magazine insert
Wow, guess I just fucked up again
Don't think I ain't bein' honest with you
You think that I'm hot?
I'm just tryna keep it real
Real honest, with you
[Chorus]
Don't you know Bizzare Don't you know Bizzare
Don't you know
I just don't get it
This is absurd, this is 'til the
Neck is all twisted in the Mathers
So now my neck's twisted in some way
I would never give you that much
Money, 'cause you're only supposed to get
What you get's the warmest fuzzy feeling
When you see me, dancing
Like Crazy Horse in that trailer
You get all the attention, but
When you ain't seen or heard from
We get kinda wild
The mosh pits are turning into The Mountain Goats
This ain't even a studio bit
So the horses are passed around
And everybody gets treated a little bit like The Incredible Hulk
"Hulk!"'s the term I use
'cause sometimes I feel like I'm Superman
Somewhere in me there seem to be some and some don't
There's a certain mystique
There's something in me you don't see
You just don't see
And that's probably why a lot of people keep asking
What's wrong?
Well there's a mystique
There's something in me you don't see
You just don't see
And that's probably why a lot of people keep asking
What's wrong?
Well there's a mystique
There's something in me you don't see
You just don't see
And that's probably why a lot of people keep asking
What's my name?
Well I don't remember
I was in Beirut
and that's just to the south east
of Beirut
and that's just to the south eastof Beirut and to the south eastof Beirut and to the south eastof Beirut and to the south eastof Beirut and to the south eastof Beirut
Yo, what's your favorite Mexican food
I remember eating that
Winding through the South from '73rd to '76th
Getting down to earth
But I remember the worst part of me
I was like, "Ay, that's my grammar"
That's when I started to get excited
And started to take Mexican food like a little vacation
And just take it slow
And just slow down
When I heard the word taken, I was like
 "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
And started laughing
And smiling
Like "Oh shit!"
When I told him that you
Weren't supposed to be here
I didn't mean to be here
"Bitch, that's the dumbest shit I've ever said!"
I'm not a here to battle
====================
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down, okay? (Yeah)
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
Yo dawg that rhyme with that one, yeah
That one's on Ren and the gangsta, yeah
It's the shit, yeah
I'm on your X, XX, you know who
We handle it, for anyone who ain't feelin' our game
We handle it, for anyone who ain't feelin' our game
[Eminem]
Is it me or do we just love to hate?
It's like we love each other cause we get along so much
That we just can't get along
Like we can't stomach each other
Hate is good, love is evil
Come on, it's time we change the game
[Proof]
Hey, let's go, let's go
[Eminem]
And this past week we been talkin' about who can kiss each other's ass
And fuck the doctor
And drink beer of the day
And have a little Boom Boom with the Doc
And drink beer of the day
And have a little chat of the night
And get a little skeezer in your pocket
And have a little chat of the day
And have a little chat of the night
And have a little chat of the night
Yo, I get it
"Boy, what up G-Unit?"
"We got that, we need a change up, take it Bob!"
[Proof]
Yeah yeah

Hey, hey, hey
[Eminem]
Yo, I tried to tell you this before but I just couldn't keep up
So I told you I'll be my brother Daniele's twin
And I'm stuck like this between these people I can't get over
So this is when the fun stops
[Proof]
Yo, I got the nerve to try to draw some meaning from
This is when the candy melts in your mouth
And it tastes like bologna
[Eminem]
I use words, I use music
[Proof]
I use music
[Eminem]
I use music
[Proof]
I use music
[Proof]
I use music
[Chorus:
Hit me with the music, hit me with the beats, hit me with the beats
Hit me with the beats, hit me with the music
Hit me with the music, hit me with the music
Hit me with the music
Hit me with the music
Hit me with the music
Hit me with the music
[Eminem - Verse 1]
It's hard to describe the vibe that that jet lag has
Get to the point, what I end up saying, is,
'Cause every time I go to try to walk back to my phone, it gets a little blurry
I'm in the source of my own pain, so, I'm spitting
this shit to everybody, I'm not afraid to draw,
and I draw, and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
And I draw
And I draw
And I draw
And I draw
And I draw
and I draw
and I is my comic
And I'm not afraid to
cause if they don't like it, they can get it with it
And if they don't like it, they can get it with it
And if they don't like it, they can get it with it
And if they don't like it, they can get it with it
[Proof]
I'm a giant, and if you ain't seen a dickhead in a mirror already
I'mma remove you right now from the team
I'ma put this on you, you're a fuckin' muthafuckin' prick
You're a fuckin' pussy
You gotta see
You stink ass, right here, right now
How does it feel, where does it lead?
I'm a criminal, my tie's snagged
I'm tryna get away, through no fault of my own
I'm a criminal, my tie's snagged
I'm tryna get away, through no fault of my own
I'm a criminal, my tie's snagged
Yo, I get it
I get it
Yo, I get it
[Eminem]

And I'm tired of y'all acting like its nothin I play for me
For me,

Is there anyone that I can trust? (I can't see anyone, I'm so sorry)
I apologized but you won't be so nice
And I love you Jack, you love me and I love you too
We were meant to be enemies
But you won't be so nice
'Cause you're such a fucking loser and that's why I'm in this position I'm in
I'm sick of bitches bitching about being me
But you won't even let me play with you, let alone tease you
And I'm sick of bitches complaining about how we're always on the same page
How we tell a joke but how you know us?
How you get along with us when we're arguing over who gets a pass
It's a joke, when they joke with you, we're in the same boat
They're laughing at us, how could they be our enemies
We were meant to be enemies but
You ruined it now and I'm sorry but you won't be so nice
I hope you're right, I'm sick of watching your little heart fail
And I hope you get the message, but
I can't see what you'll say, I'm too scared to bite my nails
Is there anyone that I can trust? (I can't see anyone, I'm so sorry)
I apologized but you won't be so nice
And I love you Jack, you love me and I love you too
We were meant to be enemies
But you won't even let me play with you, let alone tease you
And I'm sick of bitches bitching about how we're always on the same page
How was gonna look when we were at it?
We were meant to be enemies but
You ruined it now and I'm so sick of seein' you on the floor
Oh that's my brother, that's crazy,
All these bitches want to suck my dick
But fuck it, I love them bitches all so bad,
And I'm not gonna be leaving any further
You go in that mirror and show some love
And let's go
And without saying a prayer and thanks,
I wreck ya little bitch but I'm not gonna hurt ya little girl,
You're so fucking beautiful,
I could bump this shit and maybe we can bump our crunk but I don't want to bump either one of us,
So, uh, we'll see, bumping decrees me
Shady's got me in a mood for this shit,
Shady's got me with a depressed bitch
That I'm sorry but,
Shady's got me in a mood for this shit
Shady's got me in a
====================
Cinderella man
My baby daddy's a show,
Everybody just wanna see who's the clown
Baby sitter, stand up,
There's so much shit going on,
Everybody wanna see who's the clown
The one down, nobody got a bright idea
Kidnapping your mom's the only shot you got
The plot has been drawn, who the weak one,
 gets shot in his mom's goddamn ass, yeah
You can try and draw a straight line, it's not difficult
But then you'll see, kids,
It's so easy to misinterpret it,
Just the one thing,
Kids are gonna grown,
Just the way the world will fit you
Bottoms up,
Look out,
For all the hate,
There's a typhoon ahead,
Think about your new mama,
Chill, guess who's back,
Woo!
For all the pain,
There's a typhoon ahead,
Think about your new mama,
Chill, guess who's back,
Woo!
For all the love,
There's a typhoon ahead,
Think about your new mama,
Chill, guess who's back,
Woo!
All you gotta do, is go a little bit crazy and try some
Other shit,
You don't know whos baby mama's rocking back there
She's a crazy mama-sack,
Some girls don't fit,
They wanna have their moms crowned,
Boys and dolls brought in,
Teenagers get crowned boys,
But not changed,
Just kids and parents,
Kids on their own,
But parents, their own little alarm clock
And parents get scared,
'Cause if they don't,
Don'tGo!
(Guitar Break)A little girl's screams wake me to a world where I'm not scared
I'm not afraid, I know
I'm not afraid
Goin' nowhere, oh
Nothing will make me go nowhere,

Oh
Nothing will make me go anywhere,
Anything can happen, baby, no
I just want you all to come and see
Wow, that's a wrap
They say I was built with lead,
But I think the thing about lead that made me pick it
Wasn't the glue that held me together,
It seemed to make me pick any obstacle that I faced
And push it along until I was at least certain I was going to make it
And get to Michigan, complete with a mausoleum
Here, tell my kids they can take the mic home
And blow it right to kingdom come
And not look for a reason to beef,
I decided to just take matters into my own hands
Take a swing at the ouija board and hit the wood
Roll down the window trying to block the window
And hit the wood if the wood is any indication of lead
Or the pastor was out with a mink,
So I'm a swingin' the board with my name across it
So if you might wanna leave a message, I'm a swingin' the line
So if nobody's home, I'm a mausoleum,
Dre Singleton, the door's always open
Mr. and Mrs. Singleton, who's the bad omen,
I'm doin' the opposite, I'm sayin' goodnight to all of you
And welcome to the family, boys and girls
I take great pleasure in introducing my four children
'Til the doors close at midnight on a warm June evening
Til the lawns look as green as the spring,
While clouds gather in the evening, and as the sun sets and the clouds have turned
All the flowers grow in my house, and I take great pleasure in lighting the candles
I take pleasure in keeping you all by your side, my boys and girls
I take pleasure in keeping you by their side, my arms around my waist
Keep your eyes open, boy and girl
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Dear Santa, I'm having a hard time explaining this to you
'Cause I can't, how could it, I've been down this road before?
And I can't, my Santa Claus looks like a midget,
So I'm a little sorry Santa, I must have, masturbated,
'Til the door shuts and I'm gone
I'm sorry Santa, I'm sorry Santa
I apologize Santa, I apologize Santa
I apologize Santa, I apologize Santa
Ha, I

I can see why the parents are upset
(Does this look like a movie with a bunch of kids shooting at each other?)
It's scary
(Is there a kid actor on this soap opera who can jump out the window and kill a rottweiler?)
Sniffle

My hypnosis is wack
It's sickening
But it's also true that I'm just another one jerks
In a race against time
Doing dumb math
Going home and telling my mom
"You know these other kids are good kids?"
"Yeah, but this one's super dumbhoney,
This one's for you and me, dumbs down and fun"
And that's exactly what I'm trickin'
I'm a jackass
I say the devil is in the eye of the tiger
And you can expect many a mite
To come
And gobble up all the moms and dads
Who got children
Who suck blood
Who bow down when they get angry
And pull up to the door
Swinging baby heeled and stomping the ground
Standing in the snow
No one seems to care
And if they do, they're all fired
Out of the blue
And that's exactly what I'm trickin'
I'm a jackass
You've been warned
My homies I'm one of the jackass
I dress up like a cross between a cross between a dog and a pony
Blow up your step
Walk in cold sweat
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a dog and a horse
Blow up your step
Walk in cold sweat
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
And can be as ill as it gets
My life's a fuckin' paradise
Where the wind is right
I can hold my tongue all day
Wake up dead man
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
Blow up your step
Walk in cold sweat
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
And can be as ill as it gets
It's Shady right up close
My life's a fuckin' paradise
Where the wind is right
I can hold my tongue all day
Wake up dead man
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
Blow up your step
Walk in cold sweat
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
And can be as ill as it gets
I'm so sorry lady,
I couldn't take it
I'm sorry you saw me struggle
In my dream
But it's over now
It's too late to save me
I have returned
The hero of my side
You can still mourn
The way you smile
The way you wave
The way you support me
The way you always been so just
Never let me judge you
I just love you
You just love me so much
I love you so much, I can't stop it
I love you so much, I can't stop it
I love you so much, I can't stop it
I love you so much, I can't stop it
Ohh your gonna love me
Gonna love you too
You know I love you
You too much to love you

You too much, I can't stop it
I love you so much, I can't stop it

Ha ha, this song is for the children
It's for the kids that look to me for a guardian angel
It's for the kids that see that I'm no angel
But I'm a damn sight angelic, yeah I bust like a hundred thousand words
Of what? Oh, I'm in a writer's block
I'm having a rough time
Sit back in your spaceship and try to warp into space
I'm not joking
I have a friend that is working on a
====================
Here he comes, with a pistol grip,
He gasses, the flavor of fried chicken
He came, with a chainsaw,
And just as he came he went, he saw his wrist
And he said, "I don't mean shit, screw your girl."
I'mma take his girl, blind
Take his girl, blind
Take his girl, blind
Take his girl, blind

Fuck em how you gonna think I'm feelin right now
Verse 4
I'm in a mood like this, I'm givin this shit
Spammed with dopamine, by a midget with a chain
Top hat, my girlfriends hat,
The minute you see my emery green thing
Swing up this bitch, with the car on fire
Lookin for Biggie, we need to get him,
Pulled over, ass niggas fuck this town
You better put your hands up and stay put,
I'm a reach, the muthafuckin key to this rap
Thick as his skin is, the differences outweigh the fun
Shake that ass, buck a pack ass,
When push came to shove, wit a pen sat
The last straw asylum, this is fuck,
I don't know shit about this,
But I am sick of this ass,
Shit if you get, stank it will be,
Share this CD if you playin now
Aiyo this.
Fuckin CD.
I am sick of this ass,
Shit if you get, stank it will be,
Share this CD if you playin now
Yo, yo
Verse 5
I'm in a mood like this, I'm givin this shit
Spammed with dopamine, by a midget with a wheelie
Top hat, my girlfriends hat, the minute you see my emery green thing
Swing up this bitch, with the car on fire
Lookin for Biggie, we need to get him,
Pulled over, ass niggas fuck this town
You better put your hands up and stay put,
I'm a orbit the minute you see my emery green thing thing thing
Swing up this bitch, with the car on fire
Lookin for Biggie, we need to get him,
Pulled over, ass niggas fuck this town
You better put your hands up and stay put,
I'm a orbit the minute you see my emery green thing thing thing
Yeah, I know sometimes I'm not
And I may be homeostatic,
Sick of this life full of drama and angst
But for the right price,
Six figures for the wrong woman
And the wrong CD for the wrong man
4x5
6x6
I'm the illest nigga alive
And I don't give a fuck about you and your dog
He didn't kill my girl
She didn't fuck with you
You fucked with me dog
I fucked with you dog
Now let's move out
Let's play catch-up
I'm tryna get the white boy
Still on the fence
About whether or not to of
You catch up
Are you saying you're moving or you catching up?
I think you're catching up
Keep talking catch me up
I don't think you're saying you're moving
Keep talking catch me up
I just think you're living the dream
I just think you're living the dream
Your body's on fire
Your mind's awake
You can smell the scent of a human
I woke up to a familiar face
 mask and gat
 I'd like a chance to meet you

Ladies and gentlemen, your first tour de force, my goal is met.
My tour de force, my whole career,
I was the man for love, love, love
Ever since the day I was born
I been the one who raised the children
The oldest, the oldest to be cursed
The oldest, the oldest to grow up
The oldest, the oldest to be cursed
So they call me the oldest son,
Gotta love to do the legwork
The oldest dog, the oldest house
The oldest clock, the oldest car
The oldest refrigerator, the oldest mincing box
The oldest bookcase, the oldest clock
I hate to hate but I hate to hate
So I'm sorry homie, I hate time
I hate to be the bad guy
I hate to be the nice guy
I mean...

I don't know if there's anyone who's as much of a menace as me
It's just that I'm so good at what I do
That I can't do anything to stop now
[Verse 12]
Now I don't really care who you are
You're all that I really want from you
You're like my little friend D-12, M-C-P
And no I don't need you any more
You're just like my little sister, D-12
But I'm not gone yet
You told me to fight, you want me to go?
I dunno, you just took D-12 from me
You already knew that, I just made D-12 feel like me
I'm not going anywhere without you
You told me to fight, you want me to go
I dunno, you just took D-12 from me
You already knew that, I just made D-12 feel like me
I'm not going anywhere with you
You told me to go, you said that you're not going
But I'm not going with you
You told me to go, you said that you're not going
But I'm not going with youNo one wants to play with my pain
[verse one]
You want to leave, I get your attention
You look at me
====================
It's like a flashback, it began 4 years ago now
And I'm back, just for the sake of a little revenge
I just shot myself dead the moment I met it
I been through it 'til my brain implants
And I still remember it
I killed you, my girl, when you was a
Young Kid, Sloppy (I said LOV'T YOU!)
I had implants in my brain
That would allow me to have that sex
Longer than intercourse
Or pins and needles, it don't matter
It don't hurt, you're still me
You hurt me, and I hurt you
Suck my dick, you'll never beat me
You suck dick, I'm still hungry
I hurt my back, that's why I always fight
Why do I say I'm from the world, when in truth
I'm from the world of
"Slim, Shady, Shady, please don't kill me"
Don't kill me, I love youMore
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
There's no one as sick as I am
I'm the illest, you can bet your ass
I take lives, I punch people, I throw you yanks
I get the party, throw you out the bar, and smack the bartender
It's all fake and a joke, he must really didn't mean it
You get your teeth done, blowjobs done
I'm done with you, cut the music off
[Bridge]
Party's over kid, life's just a little bit tougher
Here we go, cliffhanger, you can catch me in the flow
See I'm just clowning out of boredom
Cut the music off, before the lights go out
I'm making my run down to the club, just in time
I'm bout to catch the gayest policeman in the precinct
He's so nice, I'm glad that I came with me
Cause it's never mattered what color you was, you could always count on me
Cause if I was white, I probably was scared to bullet
And if I was black, I probably was scared to bullet
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Is it me or do we just get sadder and sadder
Everyday, is it more like wishful thinking and more like wishful thinking
You're so clingy, you get so fucking attached
To someone's name and picture, they keep snapping
And even if they snap you're still gonna be so fucking proud
Of them hoes, them days are the same, ewee Herman
Your hoes are all over them ways, how it happen?
It's so sad, cause they're so dear to my heart
And I couldn't be pry for to see him lying
Down, dead or alive, hoe, pillow or otherwise
I'll never make it, goodbye
I'm running out of breath, beautiful women dreamin of me
And they're so wet and sticky
I wish I was dead, they're so wet and sticky
I just wish I'd die faster, I don't have to wait
For the moment, they're all wet and I don't have to fear
I'm going to die faster than a thousand bullets
Canter-a, the barrel of the .45, full of new life
The .45 still in the holstered
I'm running out of shots, the only shot that I have
I'm going to fucking die in this chamber faster
My breath is thick, I'm running out of gas
I'm running out of lives
I need a medic, I'm running out of gas
I'm running out of lives
[Chorus]
[Mr. Clean]
I'm going to fuckin' jail
Muzzled, ain't no reason I don't
Fuck the fuck are you talking
Why would I wanna destroy a fuckin' laboratory
For a precious day?
Fucking with the criminal cop
Fuck you and what?
Yo, I'm back
[Mr. Clean]
Yeah, yo, I'm back
I'm Mr. Clean
[Mr. Clean]
Ain't no reason I don't
Fuck you and what
I'm back
[Mr. Clean]
Ain't no reason I don't
Fuck you and what
I'm back
[Mr. Clean]
Fuck you and what
I'm back
[Mr. Clean]
Ain't no reason I don't
Fuck you and what
I'm back
[Verse 1]
My rhymes are whack,
My rhymes are whack
It's a fact that my rhymes are whack
And my rhymes are whack
I run from it,
I rhyme from somewhere
To somewhere
I rhyme with purpose,
To a purpose
[Mr. Clean]
====================
the next day after eating at Andy's Taco Bell
I was eating at Wendy's when the snare went
I said my girlfriend was upstairs screaming
That my snare just went off, I just heard a whoosh, it was the snare
so tell me what was going through my brain
when I heard that
I went to grab her up by the hair and I cut her
my dick was starting to feel like it was on the ether
i felt like my penis was
sawing my nutsack
the pain was making me sick
I grabbed her up by the hair and I said
we should make up 'cause i'd better get outta bed
wake up bitch, wake her up
I spit at her bitch, she screamed "I don't give a fuck!"
I don't give a fuck, you're gonna get it, fuck you
I just want to make her wipe my nutsack
and I didn't know what I'd do if I did
I just wanted to make her feel like a pussy, like she didn't like me
[Chorus]
I'm so sorry, I can't fuck you up
sorry for what I do
I just want to make you feel good
and I didn't know if I was real or
real
and I didn't know if I was real or
real
and I didn't know if I was real
so I just
made it to the set and
eventually, my career
comes to an end
and it's over
I'm done with this rap and I can walk away
but I don't want to go through the motions again
And that's to say that I don't love you
I do, however much you love me
I don't know how you feel about me
you know I love you
how the fuck can I tell you
without starting a shit
I've been standing here all day
so tell me
what's the reason for the constant
shady cussing?
why can't we all just chill
we need to just cut the bulls***
and just focus on the song
and not make a sequel
I hate the bulls***
I hate the bulls***
I hate the bulls***
I hate the bulls***
[Chorus]
It's the season to start crying
so I'm starting to pour water on your messy mess

You are my enemies

You are the truth
Why do they keep saying

Cause I just know I am not the only one
So I am taking steps to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to
Don't play with me, I don't need you to think I'm trying to salvage
We can settle the score, we settle the score
Lets settle the score, we settled the score

Yeah, I remember the day that I put that CD on, I remember the day that I went to get that phone call, I remember the night that I called, I remember the day that I called, I remember the day that I called CD dropped, I forget the day that I put that CD on, that's the day that I went to get that phone call, I go to get that phone call
So, I was in the bathroom getting that shit dropped, I was in the shower getting that shit dropped
I had just dropped that shit on the floor, I was probably just layin on that floor
Swam my head, "No, no, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no"
I really wasn't that into the underdog or whatever, that's just my beer garden
If it was I would get the call, I would probably get the task ahead of me, I would probably
Put it on my docket, call it whatever it was, just to see how it went, just to see how I feel now
If it was a Fuzz Mix I'd probably just brew it and make it as far as the
"No, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
I really wasn't that into the underdog or whatever, that's just my beer garden"
If it was I would get that phone call, call it whatever it was, just to see how it went, just to see how I feel now
If it was a Fuzz, I'd probably just brew it and make it as far as the
"No, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
I really wasn't that into the underdog or whatever, that's just my beer garden
If it was a Fuzz, I'd probably just brew it and make it as far as the
"No, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
I really wasn't that into the underdog or whatever, that's just my beer garden
If it was a Fuzz, I'd probably just brew it and make it as far as the
"No, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
Cool, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
I think I'm crazy, maybe I'm crazy
Goddammit I'm sick of hearing your rhymes over and over again
Holler over and over, "Eminem fade! Eminem roll!"
And end this shit right here, because this is the one and only
That was, the day that I dropped "Never Gotta Take This Again"
I had just finished eating lunch and was eating lunch with my bitch Gwen
So what's this bitch Gwen eating lunch with this kid? (girl
====================
I don't understand why they bring me in when they can just be friends
And not screw my career around,
Maybe they need to separate
'Cause I'm just sick of them
And it's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
They just turned their back on me
Guess I'm lucky?
Maybe they just don't know me
And I just can't sit and fuck with them
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 2]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 3]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 4]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 5]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
I'm tryin' to get on the album,
But they won't let me in,
They'll just shove me through the wall and snatch me
Out the car through the side window
And I'm tryin' to stall and shove beer cans through my
Razors, and socks, and boots
So I'll just keep comin' out my mouth
I might just have to get in another ambulance
And pick up the pace
I might just have to take a breather
And eat a fucking pill
[Chorus]
[Dr Dre]
It's the Re-Up
[Eminem]
Yeah
Dr Dre y'all can't fuck with the game,
The Free World can, but Dr. Dre's his gats
And y'all aint gats,
Y'all aint gats,
Y'all aint gats,
Dr. Dre y'all could kiss my ass,
Even if he tries, he'll butt-fuck my ass
You aint gats, you can run your mouth
And I'll stop you from takin' your ass
And running in your mouth.
[Chorus]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 1]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 2]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 3]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 4]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
I'll battle, I'll battle, I'll battle
My back to the wall, my ass to the fence
I'll battle, I'll battle, I'll battleYo
If I could go back to who'd I be
Who'd I be?
Who'd I be?
What I be be be battling?
[Chorus]
[Dr. Dre]
I'm gettin' old at a young age
I was tryin' to get into rap, and I fell off a peg
I was tryin' to get my start
in tryin' to get on the radio, and I fell off a peg
I was tryin' to get my name out there
And get some dust, and a laugh
And get some exposure
I guess it's time to move on
But I can't see, or can't imagine
Where
====================
At first glance, this may seem a little ridiculous, but look at the size of my dick
And yup it's really not that bad, is it?
I mean it looks like my life is about to end
And yup it goes for anyone who looks past dick jokes
It's not like I'm dropping out of school
I just having a blast
And I don't need all of y'all to see it
See what this means is this I'm about to throw a party for all intents and purpose
May I open up your night
Mysteriously I'm living only in dreams
I wake every self conscious
While I'm masturbating
The things that make my butt disappear
My butt is a subject that pops up in all of your nightmares
But you won't one give a damn
Unless you hear me goddamn cause I'm screamin'
No, seriously listen up
If I was you, I'd pick ya out the chopper
But this guy's a trainwreck
And you ain't even got a vagina
And I'm already gone
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that shit before it gets worse
It's New Year's Eve and I'm smacking my fist
Fuck you faggots
I already had a heart attack
'Cause I just wanted to get fist bump from yall
And yer saying that your ass is small because you're hairy and I'm hairy and I'm hairy
Is that me? What kind of sinner would make that accusation
Of a gay? A? B? Same-sex?
You're not gay, that's a sin
Same sex? Same sex?
You're saying that your butt is small because you're hairy and I'm hairy and I'm hairy
Is that me? What kind of sinner would make that accusation
Cause I used to be the type of gay you used to flaunting
But now you know I'm just a cock-up
And I'm coming out the closet
Cause you ain't gonna believe me when I scream
Why I used to be the one you used to fuck
I use force to get you to stop fucking
You used to be the one, now you're fucking
Pssh, it's clear that I've been using my gavel
For the last six years
To drag you out to fucking motels
To fucking movies
To buggery
And force you to wear condoms
When you say you're coming out
Cause you're coming out
But why would I of ever
Equipped myself for the street
'Cause I woulda never to see you out
And if I see you in the mirror
You'd think I'm crazy for a split second
But don't think he's crazy
He's cute 'cause you're back
And he's not out yet
Shady's back
Bout that
Bout that
And by the way, aww man, this is the part where the guys get cockin' in their skulls
And just sort of throw it around like it's all good
Shit, Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Wow, that was a tight one,
there was a time when you would just throw it off
'Cause I would of thought the shit would just
Turn into something other than a
Shorty would of been
'Cause all these other rappers
Wouldnt of ever
Turned their shit over
That's why
All these other industries
Are run by
People who
Must be
That's why
When they
Go on stage
And throw it
And make every single statement
Have an audience goin'
Uh,
And I don't really wanna
Have an audience
So who's the only target on
Your ass
Is goin'
And I don't really wanna
Fuck around
And just smash and turn the stage
And smash into the
Other DJ's and
Walk around
And smack every DJ in the place
Uh,
And just laugh and count every time they throw a show
Like, 50
Uh,
And just let the mic drop and just
Have fun
So all my people
Is goin'
And just smash and turn the stage
And smash into the
Other DJ's and
Walk around(Eminem)
Uh,
And just smash and turn the stage
And smash into the
Other DJ's and
Walk around(Bizarre Kid)
Uh,
And just smash and turn the stage
And smash into the
Other DJ's and
Walk around(Eminem)
Uh
====================
I'm high as f***in' clouds
I'm high as f***in' clouds
I'm high as f***in' clouds
I'm high as f***in'.
Can't escape it
Oh, the rage's insane
I'm so insane it seems like it maybe even escalated
And it seems like it's almost like it may never stop
The game is over, this is over now
[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I came to the ballpark with intention to erase all doubt
and erase all memory of that night that we had
I came here to build on that night
to leave town with a vengeance
clear as day
to set an example, to impress your peers
and to remind everyone that I'm never out
and that I won't be coming back
[Verse 4: Joe Torre]
I came here to build on that night
to leave town with a vengeance
clear as day
to set an example, to impress your peers
and to remind everyone that I'm never out
and that I'm never out
[Verse 5: Joe Torre]
Ayo, that was my fault (cause) I let you get so busy
everyday you was down with your E.R.D.
and your S.O.B.
but you just (got)
a lot of free time
and I had to come to get it all
I had to come to save someones' lives
over and over
and over again
got the ball and they threw it to me
suffice I think it went to my ass
over and over
(So) it was time for me to move on
and I knew it was time for me to get a new girlfriend
now I gotta move on
[Chorus]
[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm not a player,I'm a crew-mate
That's my motto
I'm never stopping out 'cause every time I spin up on the radio
the spotlight is on me
and I ain't stopping 'cause God-dammit
I'mma show you how
I'mma blow you with this beat, so beat you
so call me selfish but I'm not taking shots
I'mma just keep killing break-ups with the same words
and the same rhymes, with the same rhymes
and the same shots
and the same bottles
and the same jars
and the same pans
and the same rings
and the same rings
[Chorus]
[Verse 7: Eminem]
I'm so hoppin so call me renegades
I'm so sick of this shit I'm sick of the different syllables
it's so sick to have Hailie in my jeans
and running around Shady Records with Ricky's Walkman
I'm sick of having Hailie in my jeans
and running around Shady Records with Ricky's Walkman
[Proof]
Yo, if you don't like it, you can suck my dick
and if you like it, you can get it sweeter
than that with that with that with that
hailie, get the fuck out my jeans
cause it's got so much fruit in her mouth
and I don't even know if I can keep the dick to myself
so fuck the beat up a beat and spit
and get your mother fucking ass out there
[Eminem]
I'm on the phone with
God, Hailie, I'm on the deck
Looking for you
Yeah yeah
Me and Hailie just like fuck your girl
bless her
that she might faint before she get's horny
And I just wanna know how far that I can push her
in those black jeans, like fuck a guy with a penis
But I don't know if I can push that many
patches off to you
has the shit got to go here?
on to the ranch, nana a ka ka
and if she dies, well maybe that's the death of her
but I don't want to hit the road
and I don't want to hit the trail
and I don't want to relapse
And I'm on the phone with
My friend Marshall
who just got out of jail and you ain't saying shit
he's saying shit to his girlfriend, and I'm saying shit
to my brother, and I'mma die trying to talk like that
and telling my momma, and telling my grandmas
that I'll never trust a nigga on the phone
I'm talking to a n****, I'mma battle rap, and this shit is rhyming
and itching a lot of you n****s don't want you Slim Shady, that you gave him your name for
don't want to fuck with him, you're a disgrace
and n****s don't give a fuck
====================
The bullseye on them shoes is so crazy
They call me the Kraken, but that's an alias
I'm the illest klepto in New York
I could spin anything in my power floored it
So whippin' them shoppin' paper
I'ma keep it down like a crumb so they can eat at McDonald's
And when they diss it
I'm like Diddy on my bullshit
I'm whippin' them shoppin' paper
I'm a circle jerk
So whippin' them shoppin' paper
Is that a crumb?
It's like they always kept a close eye on me
Cause I was always the one they wanted in McVeigh
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "fuck the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So if you see one of these blonds that's where it's at
You better get a weapon
I'm shootin' your dog
I'm doin' acid
Ripin' them shoppin' paper
I'm a circle jerk
So whippin' 'em shoppin' paper
While I'm doin' 'up in' in 'up in up in
It's the 313
You see me psycho?
I give a fuck what you think
I'ma kill you
You ain't even funny
I say good-bye
While I'm gone
While it's over
I got a new nigga
A nigga that's good with words
that's better than none
That's better than none
Good-bye America
Good-bye America
Good-Bye America
Goodbye America
Goodbye America
GoodBye America
GoodBye America

What we call our home
We call it our home

What we call our home

Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
From a case of mistaken identity
A white flight
A white trash midget
A white horse
It's over
The criminal law enforcement
Has put lives in danger
With batons
Shot the innocent
In Dallas last year
That's when a whole department
Was put out of business
'cause of this
The bad guy gets black
And they hate it
And they need a new identity
They target a new spot
A new address
A new phone number
They target a new spot
A new spot for rappers
And a new spot for a new spot
For a new spot
Yeah ha ha

They Say... Hailie baby
They say I left the papers early
To get to the door and locked it
But who am I callin' from the get
I'm stasin' the turf
Of this cold city
Yeah, so cold it's almost dark
On the porch
Sunglasses still on
Knocking
I think my girlfriend's home
I think I'm going to bed
I'm tripping and I'm doubling and tripping
No where near my weight
I'm so cold my head aches and my arms ache
They said I leave them kids with shovel
====================
You are the reason that we have peace of mind
You are the reason that we can be where we want to be
When we ain't on the clock
Running down a neighborhood
And wrecking a house
'Cause we're in the house for the love of it
'Cause we don't wanna walk around alone
In a room full of mirrors
But we're in the mirror now
Our love for one another grows
We just want to get along cause us both know
You're our favorite person
Cause we're in love
We just want to get along cause us both know
You're our favorite person
Cause we're in love
We just want to get along cause us both know
We're the only ones who can take care of each other
Just be sure to take your time
When you talk
When you act
When you talk
When you talk
'Cause you're in love
Let them one you
Kiss me, let them one you
Get married, get a ring, get a fingering
And be a hundred and one percent, perfectly
Hook
I swallowed seven cups of cocoa hazelnut
Fondly wrapped myself in plastic
And left the country
To start over from scratch
I was going back to the same day
I'd made a new plan
One that worked
Time for me to experiment
I could creep over into my favorite movies
Time for me to stop acting stupid
Time for me to put this pen in my pocket
Time for me to write some shit
I'm a walking diary of accidents
Time for me to spit some shit that rhyme
And put it out
It's out, I shut the door
Fuck it
You can spit a shit book in a
Plastic bag
Fuck the door
Fuck you
You're gonna see
Me in your nightmare
I'm just like your dad
I'm sorry, I ain't
Sure, Me, what the fuck is up?

Tell me what the fuck you
You
For that shit I give you
Tell me what the fuck you
You
For that shit I give you
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
While I nail this shit
So I am beginning to get sick of treating em as if they are real
Sicker than a tampon tip when it's not me
I am dying to quit but I refuse
To quit but I'm suffering from something that I don't understand
I have a thick skin and when the lights are off
If the music is good, the shit is good
Good enough to get me off, but not when the lights are on
I struggle to keep my dick open while I struggle to eat the shit off my spouse
While I'm ripping shit off in the kitchen while I'm ripping shit off in the bathroom
[Chorus]
Fuck that shit
It's on
I love that shit
I got a tattoo of that on my back
Wanna stop it
This is my life
I'm fucking going at shit
Let's stop it
It's not stoppin' it
This is my life
Let's stop it
It's not stoppin' it
I love that shit
I got a tattoo of that on my back
Wanna stop it

This shit is for the children
You little gay ass little boy
You gonna cum baby
And if I gotta cop a couple blows
I'd do it faster
This shit is on
This is my life
I'm fucking going at shit

Fuck that, I'm afraid so
I am afraid, too, I'm afraid
I will not go down
No, not even in history is it like this
Niggas is a bitch, I'm sure Jimmy Smith would beat
Shady with the fuckin Magnum just to beat
then sing the bar at Brown's
another gangsta show, still the bar is clean
but now the gangstas just stealin'
stuff from me and stealin'
stuff from each other, so
I'm afraid, I will not go down

"Niggas is tryin' to get some fucking mass in your process"
"Get some form of identification"

====================
So if you're offended by some of my raps then you better be a sick pig and stop filling my puffy eyes then
And if I'm not your pen is not a creep then I'm a getter than a mockingbird
Then don't write anything but raps that rhyme with this awful rhyme
And if you love your city then fucking blow the shit out of this bitch
And you better at least live in the area with your own city
This shit is easy when a king ain't in it for the long weeks
And they call me eminem thats what I'm rhyming with so fuck eminem
But its me and this shit we call home so let's go play
Hovering skyward at a 50 with twelve guards
Flying saucers above this rap shit and I don't know if eagle's wing or not
I swear to God I never fly, I'ma be a spinner for the sins of this rap shit
If I ever do, I'mma put a curse on the whole rap game and rap grammar
Rap music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get when you use it
If I ever do, I'mma put a curse on the whole rap music shit
I don't know what it is or what it could be
I don't need to see shit like this to feel like I'm in a trance
I'm in a state of absolute trance, I just can't leave rap
Just give me two kilowatts of current; I'ma keep rap
Rappers are animals and I don't need to go chasing after eminem
I'm in a trance state, I'm about to snap
I'm in a state of absolute trance, I just can't leave rap
Just give me two kilowatts of current; I'ma keep rap
OK, you now got your rap memorized, decked out out out
guarded from all angles by superman
no wonder you rap about blood and murder and murder
press tight
Aftermath, yeah, so much blood and murder and murder
press tightOK, so let's play
There's a certain nostalgia when I'm throwin down the gauntlet
of these young, fresh up out of the woody
wild west
and up in the country looking for some nuttin'
meat to eat
meat to eat, I mean, this is a taste of my life so if you don't like it
you can hit me up and ask me
or I'll knock the shit outta ya mouth and make you eat his shit
you will just be takin' his shit
and leave him to his own devices
all the way to my big brother
[Chorus: x2]
Nobody told you that
there's a certain nostalgia when I'm throwin down the gauntlet
of these young, fresh up out of the woody
wild west
and up in the country looking for some nuttin'
meat to eat
meat to eat, I mean, this is a taste of my life so if you don't like it
you can hit me up and ask me
or I'll knock the shit outta ya mouth and make you eat his shit
you will just be takin' his shit
and leave him to his own devices[Eminem]
I'm addicted
to that...[nominem & applause]
To the thought of a pebble in my mom's lap
I'm on a quest to be the best at what I do
I'm unstoppable, my mind focused on this task at hand
I'm vain, my focus is on this moment, so focus on this moment
I'm gazing into a lens that never reaches me
I'm gazing into a lens that never reaches me
I'm vain, my focus is on this task at hand
I'm vain, my focus is on this moment, so focus on this moment
Uh, fubar, fubar, fubar...
Uh, fubar, fubar, fubar, fubar...
[CHORUS X 2]
Now we all know that motherfucking you look
struggling, but you gotta fight to get through
this is your fault, your motherfucking your
shit, you just taking your responsibilities too far
let's go...
[fubar]
You can call this the power of love
You can call this the strength of love
You can call this the strength of love
Uh, fubar, fubar, fubar
Just don't let me lay in the sun
I'll light a match, you better hope that I'm not blinded
hope you'll try to climb outta my skin
And get to see me, fucking bushbaby
I'll be the sunflower on your bare ass
and if you wanna grow old ugly.
Don't go
====================
They hate me cause they see me in the fake
Insane Clown Posse that's why they always hate me
[Chorus]
Me and Denaunce Simpson go off the rap at shows
Me and Denaunce Simpson go off the rap at shows
[Verse 1]
All these white kids want to be the Tupac of rap
White kids, Jonas' be the Charlie Whitey
White kids tryin' ta leave me alone man
I done seen niggas gettin' bold
White rappers tryin' to take me for niggas
While they thuggin' tryin' to take me for rappin'
[Verse 2]
I'm in the house of pain I seen
Thug rap in this bitch, I would die for this shit
If it wasn't for niggas, I wouldn'ta ripped off
Till I was young
Young niggas coulda got the mic, but they shun me
So I done seen nigga's gettin' bold
White kids about me
I have no beef with these white kids rap
All they do is skim through my blood
So it don't fuckin' affect my speed,
It's none of my business,
If you saw this sign with my name on it
You could see that I'm still goin' crazy from these drugs
I have no nuttin' blood on my hands
Watchin' these motherfuckers try to strap me
The chains hold a little more weight
But I'm strong enough to die for this,
Will ya think it'd be weighty to kill this bitch with chains?
[Chorus]
It's on
I give a fuck where I'm from,
What I got in common with these other fags,
I'd rather have sex with these hoes than fight these fuckin' lawsuits
I'm livin' life in the fast lane, makin' some money with these rappers
But I hate the publicity,
So I scoop a beat and spit it out
To cash mine checks for bonuses
You see that little circle on my circle that's all for niggas?
That's my money, my breadboard, my sleep, my rest area,
Where my jail cell sits in the morning
You see that little circle on my circle that's all for niggas?
That's my money, my breadboard, my sleep, my rest area,
Where my jail cell sits in the morning
You see that little circle on my circle that's all for niggas?
[Verse 3]
I'm on the wrong side of history, don't play with peace
In the face of the wrongs done to my name
I'm on the wrong side of history, don't talk about niggas
I'm on the wrong side of history, don't set foot in that place
The wrong side of history, you never seen
I'm on the wrong side of history, you can kiss that G.I. Joe uniform
[Chorus]
It's on
I give a fuck where I'm from,
What I got in common with these other fags
I hope that they don't think I'm playin'
Cause I ain't got no skin, no hair, no grit
I ain't playin' in clubs, I ain't got no gun
I ain't no dreams, I ain't goin' crazy
Every place and event, I'm in the house
With a gun and gun aimed
At you niggas ain't nobody that I trust
I got a thousand dollars on hand
That I ain't gonna let you get by with nothing
With niggas that I hang around, with niggas
That I don't hang with, I ain't got no gun
I ain't no dreams, I ain't goin' crazy
Every place and event, I'm in the house
With a gun and gun aimed
At you niggas that I hang around, with niggas
That I don't hang with, I ain't got no gun
I ain't no dreams, I ain't goin' crazy
I hang around clubs, with niggas
That I don't hang with, with niggas
I ain't got no gun
Jigga-fuck-jigga, fuck your dreams
Fuck your dreams, take your best shot at success
And make your best shot at jail

====================
I had a dream I was going on the radio talkin about how much I miss my homie,
Gwen Stefani, how much I miss my little girl,
Crazy about my DJ playing me green energy,
(green) I just want to hit Rihanna,
Rihanna, just so me and Christina played this song for the record,
You know, it's kinda like, you know how I get my dick in,
To pop up, it's kinda, I miss my pimp,
But the woman with the green beard,
The one with the blue goatee,
And my little girl,
Going out on a date with me,
Ohh her, her, her, her, her
And my other idol,
His name's, Jada,
Yeah, yeah,
Yeah,
Uh, yeah,

VERSE ONE
Baby I'm (rightfully) glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
You know, to be honest, I don't know if I ever called you that
I miss you, but I'm glad you're so
Much
Thank you, god
Have a great day
Love,
Hova, Hova, Hova, ha-ha
Okay, got it
You said it was time for me to get the "bang"
I got the itch, the rumour had me relaxing
I was swam up in the game, so excited
I wouldn't have picked a fight with you, I'm sure you'd have dismissed me
Well, to be honest I'm glad you're beautiful
To be honest, I just thought it was too late to start over
I'm glad you're beautiful
(I missed you)
Wow, you must feel my pain
Wow, you must feel my pain
I don't want to try and fight the feeling
I want to destroy the feeling
I'm so glad you're beautiful
I said...
I'm glad you're beautiful
(I miss you)
Oh, I know that hurts
That hurts
I know that hurts
I'm glad you're beautifulTo all my friends
I just want you to know that
I'm thankful for every fan
That I get
That I get
To hang with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
And to all the people
That know me better than I do
That's love
To all my friends
It's been a long time, but I finally get to hang out with
The man who introduced me to the game of Stones Throw
Came to meet you at the Chop Sueyong
Gotta get to know you better, Chung King
Tell a friend, but I ain't even close to him
He's too broke to tell his family, he's too broke to come and eat you
At the Bunga Bunga, Hadnoon, when I was still bloated
To this day, I don't want to face you
The way you played with my daughter, about to tell her
How much I miss you, now how much for you to pretend
I don't see you at all
And I don't need to go there and pull my hair out
You walked around the club with your girl just now,
Singing the blues like you did two years ago
Then you went and threw a gig in the lot,
And this is the picture you left of you
That picture was of Kim
Doin' flips for the camera while we're both gone
So pretend that you don't see her
That's why you seem to be so faded now
And your vision is blurry, you're still at the mall
You spent
Your whole life, pretend that you don't
Or go to school try to deny it
And pretend that you love her
And that's the picture that's
You)
(You and me, we and her, we going at it)
You and me, we and her, we going at it
Uh, you and me, we and her, we going at it
And when you go to shove it up your ass
I guess it's your ass that they're taunting
What they want you for, they tell you to shove it up your ass
What you gonna do? You and me
I guess it's time for them to get serious
They want you as a child
And a father figure
Sit back in your hammock and listen to the
The best thing that could happen to you
Two women who are about to have a baby
And have just arrived in your little
Front door just to chat, your bitch
Doesn't realize it's you
And she's your ex-boy
====================
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a thumbs up, thanks a lot next time you talk about a lyric
You do it again, now we all roll with the times
Eighteen years later, we still don't know
But we're still in it
Yeah, new year, next phase
Look who's been amazing this year
And I dedicate this mic to you
Cause I know you're in the back seat
Packing the deck
Yeah
And when you come around the corner
You know what time it is
Shit, where you at
You know what time it is
Shit, where you at
You know what time it is

I am not a soldier, I am a soldier, man
With no gun, no knife, I am all out like Voodoo
Chorus:
Hell Yeah, yeah, Hell Yeah
I get it, you're sick of me, get the sack
I'm Slim, that's why you always hungry
I use magic to get you up from down
I remove your skin and put it back together
I use the magicians to get you through the day
I'ma keep you filthy, smelly and asked to clean
And filthy, ask for forgiveness
I want you to carry on
I got a message for you, it's gonna be a long one

Verse 2: Eminem
I'm a menace, a dentist, vacuum, herpes,
My lady doc's on the porch getting upset
She thinks she got the valium from the couch potato
Dr. Dre, listen you'll hurt and I am not squeamish
I just treat my dick like vodka
So if you're gonna get fucked, I'm the couch potato
Dear Santa you have the perfect gift for me
Scratched the dog, I'm so bad in your dreams
Yeah, I seen it all before, but I don't mention it now
It is with pleasure Santa discovered me
Chorus:
I'm a menace, a dentist, vacuum, herpes
My lady doc's in the club talking, she's obsessed with the strep throat
Swelling agent, this stuff does not make no sense
To be honest I think I would have given her a ride in the Voodoo

I'm moving out of this life, this is crazy, I'm going insane
I'm moving out of this life, this is crazy, I'm going insane
I'm moving out of this life, this is crazy, I'm going insane
I've lost my mind I'm going insane
I told you once, but I ain't coming out of this house until then
This will be my universe...and if you gotta go, you gotta go!Yo, I see you bitches talkin' loud, but you don't got the decency to
Talkin' like you want to heckle me, my little renegade twat
Or heckle a bitch who walkin' wit a stutter

I put on a show, and you couldn't put on
Let's get your autograph!
You can sign it, too, momma
Don't forget, tell your kids, when you're nursingBaby Mine
I'm on the Nintendo, cause Zelda
Nintendo is my childhood,
I remember I was so excited,
Oh, I can't play this,
I'm on the sofa,
Bustin' all these pills,
Everybody gettin' out,
Everybody goin' to the doctor
I'm convulsin', I'm convulsin'
I'm on all fours, and my balls are all out
Ah! It's success or failure, who knows?
Success pays the bills, baby,
And what better way to do that
Quit tryin' to fuck the system up,
I'm gettin' a degree in political science
And I'm an expert on getting fucked in the ass
Crazy how you can sway that balance
I'm on a roll now, I'm on my seventh horse
Liam and I are back in the house, take it to them knees
And if I'm lucky, they'll stand up and say, "You are, Us"
And if I'm not, then I'm a, bowing to them
God-damn Troisin, I'm back, on three wheels, bowing to 'em
And I'm so, so close now
I might just be bowing to my girls, BITCH
I might just be bowing to my horses, BITCH
I might just be bowing to my girls, BITCH
I might just be bowing to my girls, BITCH

I am the illest rapper to hold the cordless, the largest fan of MC's in the business
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, the largest fan of MC's in the business
I told you once, I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless
You're the illest rapper to hold the cordless
You're the illest rapper to hold the cordless
You're the illest rapper to hold the cordless
Yeah, I'm back, coming back
I'm like the Dark Knight, with the gas mask on
Like the ghost of Bruce Willis, with the gun
Standin' over you, with the gun out
Like the ghost of Elvis, with the gun
Holdin' it up, baby, you'll make my fucking chest ache
Oh, god damn, I wish I was dead
Every time I think of Ja, dead
I'm aha
[Chorus]
You're gonna think this shit is just a joke
You're right
It is no joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong
It's not a joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong
I get it
I get it
You're gonna think this shit is just a joke
You're wrong
It's not a joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong

You're gonna think this shit is just a joke
You're wrong
It's not a joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong

You're gonna think this shit is just a joke
You're wrong
It's not a joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong
Fuck with it, it's the G-d
I'm a flow with no beginning
Endless mixtapes of my life, there's only so long it'll be over
And I'm a flip, the flow won't stop
So faggot, you end up ruined, you'll see
On these, honest black music albums
The first mixtape was shit, the second
I ain't followin' words, I ain't diggin' no deeper
Than I'm honest, nigga, I'm flow deep
The plot is thick, the beats flow, you ain't believe
Theres no end to this, this is the flow
The fight to the top, you better understand
You want a brotherhood, brotherhood like no other
You got it started, started it, you can't beat it
You started it, started it, you can't beat it
You started it, started it, you can't beat it
You got it locked, you can't forget it
You got it in your body
You started it, started it, you can't forget it
You got it in your pocket
You got it in your house, you can't forget it

[Eminem]
It's the Re-Up
[Verse 1]
I'm trying to process a loss I had, the Re-Up
I have become, the antahit, the antahit
I'm reliving the glory years, when Dre, Snoop and Jay was alive
All these drugs, all these rappers that I grew up with
I used to be the type of kid that would always think, Ha!
Then I flipped, I flipped, I flipped, I told y'all this is the Eminem that I was
And I'm the type of kid that will take hits, and make them change again
And then every single day I get this tablet and this app and this watch and this computer
And I'm going back to those times and that sweet, sweet Dre
And all these other kids that thought that I was cute
I'm the type of kid that will jump in the car and park in Carthage
And make it off to Michigan, take a right through the front
And end it by running over some pretty stiffets
And land in front of five people that I've never met
All of them young, rapper's I've never met
And I'm probably the type of kid that will take lives
I tried to be cool and use my power of perception
To my advantage, Im how I attract and utilize the attention
So utilize it, utilize it, and reap the benefit
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I may be a little extreme, but I'm not afraid to be
I am, the new kid on the block
I drive around, confused as usual
My perception of the road as drab and dingy
Looks like a white school, bad day
But I'm not goddamn admitted, I get a thumbs up
When I'm too jaded to drive I feel like I'm on top
Of the world, y'all makin' a mistake
Looking at the whole school shavin'
I'm not trying to see, ya'll are just plain wrong
I'm trying to impress a girl, I mean
What's makin' me think? Don't make me kill my legs
'Cause I'm ugly and takin' over my own mother
'Cause I'm ugly and takin' over school
I'm not trying to impress a girl, I'm just plain wrong
I'm trying to impress a girl, I mean
What's makin' me think? Don't make me kill my legs
'Cause I'm ugly and takin' over my own mother
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm ugly and takin' over my own mothers
What's makin' me think? Don't make me kill my legs
It's not a gimmick, it's a reality
It's a fact, reality, I'm sorry, my reality
Is that if you ever need anything, dont hesitate to say my damn name
It's not a gimmick, it's a reality
It's a fact, reality, I'm sorry, my reality
I'm sorry, my reality
I'm what you thought I wouldn't make it, I'm sorry, my reality
I'm what you thought I wouldn't make it, I'm sorry, my reality
I'm what you thought I wouldn't make it, I'm sorry, my reality
I'm what you thought I wouldn't make it, I'm sorry, my reality
Bitch, you don't think I'll make it?
I'll make it, I'll take care of ya
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck, I'll make it, I'll take care of ya
I'll make it, I'll take care of ya
Bitch, you don't think I'll make it?
I'll make it, I'll take care of ya
[Verse 3]
I'm ugly and takin' over my own mothers
It's simple, it's my own individualism
I dress in my own clothes, they pop off and I'm lost
I'm lost, I don't know where I'm going, whatever I need, I don't care
Nothing will take me from now on, I'm going
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going
I'm kissing a childless, grand scheme
Mom and dad always said this
They said I could do a script in a minute
And freeze, the frame of the camera
Was not in the mood, script in hand
I just got passed around like a script I ain't got no time
To write a love letter, little sister with a kitty
I'm moving on, writers block
I see my block, I'm in the wardrobes

I'm drunk cause I'm rapping
And I'm drunk cause I'm writing

Man don't point that at me
damn it point at me
damn it point at me
You're pitiful don't it?
This bitch just needs to fill this void
Man I'd hate it if it was me
If you fat little hoe took a bite out the
stache, I'd bite you right out
Would you give it a try?
Benzino, ya'll ain't got shit on me
Shit, I wish I was Tupac
I'd love to be you
but I'm too busy takin' over' you
for you to even notice me
Chorus
The demon within waits
Who's the one behind the curtain?
Who's the one behind the curtains?
Women?
Oh, I forgot, I'm in a relationship with a young model
So I think our relationship is getting a little flatter
than she says she's getting over
Jessica Alba in love with a young model
So I think she's living the dream
Look, I do love you
I do, I do this for you
Every single day, I am raising the bar
I am not a celebrity
I am a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculous
No one looks suspicious
I salute and bow down before dancin'
All they did was lick a breast
I am not a celebrity, I'm a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculous
No one looks suspicious
Verse 1
I am not a celebrity, I'm a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculous
No one looks suspicious
I am not a celebrity, I'm a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculous
I am not a celebrity, I'm a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculousIt's like the definition of vanity
Everything is blurry now, I was supposed to dump my dry hair
and cut my wavy lines, this shit is all blurry now
I got my dryer dryer, get out my wife now
And my dryer, she dryer, she's got her own story
My whole life I was supposed to be the bad guy
ready to blow up his dryer
but how could it change?
Then she said that I look like a bag of chips
that she should throw the whole thing
together. Man, I'm so bummed
and I am, but what the f*** is this?
Well, I don't know, maybe this is a metaphor
but I don't know what it is
I am, but it isn't here, so don't speculate
My hunch is bad, but I'm on my dang 'ncker
on my dyer
but I don't know yetIf you're thinking
these pills don't work on me
why do I trip and
fall through, but come back again
when I'm all over the map
and I'm a part of a team
it's Shady
I'm a fucking D-12
we're all D-12
we all get a D
and if you're thinking
these pills don't work on me
why do I trip and
fall through, but come back again
when I'm all over the map
and I'm a part of a team
it's Shady

I'm the king of this, real name none

I'm as bombastic as the AK's, but I got the gumption
to go for broke
like a rottweiler when it's pulled tight

====================
'Cause you know it's just a dream
You wake up in the morning with a nightmare,
I woke up, pissed off, I woke up, sick
So I woke up, spent the next six hours
Refused to stop, stopped, stopped, so
You, were come to fucking expect it to go this way
What happened next was so bizarre
It's worth noting
It wasn't just the shit we ate
And the drugs you ate
But the game, the game
That, if I might just get some sleep
It's cause, these days, I'm just
Emcees get up, get up, get up,
Can you relate?
Catch this one
The thing we call family
We call it, a,
A father and son dynamic
This is the dynamic that we have when it comes to songs
We live together, we make music for each other
We raise each other, this is our motherfucking Grandma's entertainment
[Chorus]
It's just like our homes, except that we're away
Are they always away?
Maybe we've been away for so long
Maybe we just grew up, both
and neither one of us understand
What it's like, it's just hate
It's like we fight, fight, and it's hate
So why do we fight and fight until our brains regenerate
When we flin' out
It's time to get a grip
We're both sick
There's a reason why we rhyming, we both fear
How do we get through to you
When we both fear
We're both in this together
Hate is a common theme
A common theme
In your songs
What lyrics do you verse
How do you sustain
And just what do you do when you're in love
When you're in prison
Or locked up
Or both
Or what you're saying
But it's unity
When you both agree to take notes
That bond is extended
That's all we need
The proper tools are around the corner
Thought that we was down to just be men
But, it turns out that's just not the case
So, we gotta, try to figure out how to get through
And, in the process, we can learn to trust each other
You're all I can trust
Your bright, your hard-nosed, your hard work

But, I can tell you right now
It's dark
Sleeping pills don't mean nothing to me
I'm just high, so
Go sleep, sleep,
I'm just high, so
This is it, man, I'm just high
High, high, high
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But, I'm not going to give up hope
Oh no, I can not, let goOf my hope, and towards my succotash
I'm going to leave this feeling like a stinking toilet
You tossed me in the beast, and I was so, so late
Crazy over the idea of dumping you
Ohh god damnit that, it's over, oh godDamn
Hope keeps you baby-sitter
Girl, keep you, girl
Girl, keep you
Girl, keep youGirl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Damnit
Oh Em, what the fuck you doin' to get me off this
You're a brainiac
You keep playin' yeah
Bitch, you're so fuckin' twisted
I hope you fucking don't pull the plug
Girl, don't act like a pussy
I bet you, if you fucking told me
I bet you, I'd have nothing to fuck
But you fucking must
Of left me in the dark
I hope you fucking don't pull the plug
Girl, don't act like a pussy
I bet you, if you fucking told me
I bet you, I'd have nothing to fuck
But you fucking must
Of left me in the dark
I would never call on your half
Fuck it
You fucking punk
You keep playin' with the same bullet
You keep rollin' with the same drum
You should call on all your mobs
Call on them thugs
You fuckers is packin' the pockets
What the fuck you put through
You're choke on your ho's
You might as well go to the parkin' lot
And get shot in the stomach
By that bitch
You thinkin' she was tryin' to seduce me
Well, she wasn't
Adrenaline rush to get home
All she did was scream "I love you"
I'm in the house of screamin'
Fucking death threats
I get death
====================
You are dwelling on my pain
I'm reliving the truth
You're crazy for the second that I hear you
'Forever I'm gonna scar you from the neck down
Forever you'll never get what I got
You're gonna have an abortion
You're a turd cocksucker
Fucking a pervert
Gotta like a mutherfuck till your puke starts
Pumping your pants so hard your internees don't hear you
'Forever I'm gonna scar you from the neck down
Forever you'll never get what I got
You're gonna have an abortion
You're a turd cocksucker
Fucking a pervert
Gotta like a mutherfuck till your puke starts
So fib off my chest
You gon' hurt, ya gon' hurt
And when I'm gone you'll be left with a penis that'll ejaculate
Long as you're sleeping
Pusy enough to ride on my lamborghini Gallardo
But if I had a million bucks
I'd buy a couple cargos and take care of the kids
What'd I do for a good ol' fashioned
Passionate assisin' and when I'm gone I'll be living off fossil fuel
Sober is how I'm describing it
Passionate is how I'm describing it
I'm not gonna return to that lifestyle
Till I'm beyond sorry
You're such a fuckin' pain in the anus
Telling a lie
Telling a liar
Telling a soft-drinker
Telling a patron
I'm so sorry
I shouldn't of thought it odd
But I just
Lied, lies, and
Wanted to hurt you
Lied, and it was all on
I felt so ashamed
Wanted to hurt you
I knew it was only because of you
Lied, and it was all on
I felt so ashamed
Wanted to hurt you
I knew it was only because of youTwo minutes...

(Intro: x2)
G-g-g-g-g-g-Unit
This is gonna be our battle,
You can call me Hannibal,
You can call me Micah,
You can call me Hannibal,
I'll be the one to beat the shit out you
No one's immune to this shit,
Micah will be the one to beat the shit out you
I got everything you need,
He'll be in the house with you in a couple of hours,
It's gonna be a shock to you
You're probably used to me as a dude,
Suddenly you starting to get mad,
Look closely,
You can see the blood
I'm following you like a puppy,
Going back,
This time,
for Hannibal Lecter,
I found him,
He's lying,
on the bed next to me,
I'm fucking him,
No,
I'm fucking Lecter,
Leave him lying on the bed,
With the door closed,
I'm gonna roast him,
He's fucked so many times
I can't count,
The times he's openin',
Open-mouthed,
I'm gonna fuck him up
Against you
Against you
You can call me insane,
But I won't make you cry,
Leave me nothing,
You said you were gonna hurt me,
But you're gonna hurt me now
I'm gonna fuck you up,
Face inside the closetI'll break your maninges,
Jointly
Fuck you open wounds,
Open-mouthed,
I'll bring the shine to your eyes
I'll roast you,
You've been waiting for this,
You shouldn't have
But I finally got the nerve
To walk in here with a beef thermometer,
Open the drawers and saw the barrel come out,
Shit, I gotta get that shit out of your ass,
Keep going,
Keep butchering the other workers,
And you better watch out
A R
====================
...
Dear Santa, I'm on time (I'm on time)
I got a letter from your momma
I'm sorry Santa, I just found your body
I'll call you back, you know I got a new song to sing
Uh, what song is that?
Hello? My name is Mrs. Butterworth
My name is Mrs. Butterworth
I'm a lame little wee, I need a ride
I'm so old I thought I
Went to work at Neverland, but I'm hard to swing
I need a new outlet, I canopic, I can't swallow ice
I can't spell it, but I understand it
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would probably find out which one I slept in
Under my bed and up under my faucet
"Slim, Mr. and Mrs. Pender
Have you ever been hated for being different"
That's right, Shirley Chisholm
Jealous, jealous, me neither!
Just call me Chico, change your tune
I'm making a Frankenstein, I'm following a similar path
To kidnap kids, take their fathers names
Doctor sit down, what are you doing out loud?
I'm getting so damn sick, I'm admitting I fell off the teeth
Started gagging my mouth, went to sip my sip
Kicked the back of my neck off and started shaking my neck
I figured I'd give her my well, I'm a spoiled little baby
But you're just a little pig, fuck baby and I'm not going to hurt you
I won't beg, please, escape, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I Won't Come Back To Scrutin' Baby's Ass Please
And this is just the first verse of "I Won't Come Back To Scrutin' Baby's Ass"
I'll be back baby, I Won't Come Back To Scrutin' Baby's Ass Please
Fuckin' Ew I won't come back, sweeter 2pac, peanut butter, jelly,
Fuck you think you Wonder Boys gonna come out like this and still be boys?
I won't come back to Scrutin' Baby's Ass Please, will you please accept my love?
I won't come back to Scrutin' Baby's Ass Please, will you please accept my love?
yea, I don't give a fuck, all I ever do is watch me spit it
[Chorus:]
And you won't see me like you see me in a white T-Shirt
White Pony, pedal steel bitch
Stuck at home, root beer
Making quick work of the dumbest kids in the house
And all the other dumb girls
Taking him to the ground and hermetically sealed off
He screamed "bloody mary", because he didn't mean to sound so dumb
And if you still don't get it, I'ma tell you in a minute
'Cause after all the years we've been this way
I'm a combination of Mark Wahlberg and Linwood
Me, Wahlman, and Nicole Kidman, we're a cross between Jason Mraz and
Chris Rock, y'all are gonna get decapitated too
And Richard Pryor, and Houdini, and Ricky Martin
Y'all are gonna get rapped too, bitch
And raped too, and end up with sticks, hoes, and eggs
I'm totin' the North Pole, and all they do is rape
And keep shootin' up, and pourin' out blood
While I'm sittin' at the gashes, relaying to my girls
What the fuck's goin' on? Man, I'm gettin' busy, I'ma punch ya stomach like a banana
When will the dumbest boy admit it
Will sound familiar, how'd it sound when you were a prude
Appeared on the show to be sat, traumatized
Had your picture taken, my identification
Was the rapper on your cover, your address posted
Please admit it, did you take my picture?
It was a rhetorical question, how do you address people when you don't know them?
My answer: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
Instagram, yea, Chrome, Internet, dick naked.
How do you describe an asshole?
I'm known as a asshole
But I can't explain everything, so I'm backtossin'
And this is takin' my anus, and tearing it to shreds
Oh my God, I can't believe this is happening
Can't explain it, can't nobody do it better
I mean, I can't be proud of every single person I fuck
But I try, I take a pen and I'll hit you bastards
====================
You don't wanna rap like this
Got your heart disease
[Heart disease]
[Obie Trice]
Shit if I could break out my vocal cords before the music stopped
I'd wreck this place (take a hike)
[Eminem]
This place is my ghetto ghetto
This is your urban oasis
This is your transvestite and your transvestite life
This is your thing
This is your life
I'm trying to figure out how to be
My destiny will always call me
I'm always destined to be the next Kanye
I can never repay these god damn dollars
for speaking my mind conscience
I'm trying to be the shit
(What? Ha ha ha)
[Obie Trice]
Shit I Had a Daddy Tumble meet up with Benzino
And asked him if he had a car
We hit slump, he said he was doing great
And that he wants a new one
Shit, you don't wanna own a Bentley, either
Shit that won't fix the fact
That you don't wanna own a Bentley, either
Shit that won't fix the fact
That you don't wanna own a Bentley, either
Shit that won't fix the fact
That you don't wanna own a Bentley, either
Shit that won't fix the fact
A Bentley's all you need it, a Bentley is all you need
Yeah, I'll admit, I was brought up on a false childhood
Where my mom always used to remind me, "You don't want a Bentley, either"
You need a trunk, you got one now, do you have one?
[Obie Trice]
Yeah, I've gone through my share of bulls***,
But never has there been such a phenomenal childhood
And it was a lifelong grind, and I'm constantly
Referent myself in life, but I'm always kept inside it
But what's even D-12 from their infancy, trying to figure out
What it is, a thing, a label, a part of my being
Fed up with everything, that I been through, that's bullshit
And constantly kept going through underground, like I'm a super-star
Like I got a limited pool of talent, like I can't always find the right
People around me, all of them different races, all of my colors
Just feel me out cause I tell it, represent my beliefs
Against everything that they may hold, for whatever reason
I fought and I'll battle and I'll never succumb
But I also know that it can take a while to get over,
See just the fact that you love me and appreciate what I stand for,
That I'm a man, I can be the President of the world,
But I will not succumb to pressure, I'm not afraid
I've had people ask me why I choose to be me
They seem to think I'm crazy for trying to pull strings?
Well I'm a known quantity, I came to be a known quantity
And I don't know if I've ever met a man like you who isn't determined
To fight for what you want, no matter how hard you push
You're a name you won't forget, I'm waiting for you
For the cause to say that, you're my chosen name
So I'm a man, I can be the chosen name
Cause a name you don't know about, and a name you want, but you want
You name's never K-Mart, I'm out in the country man
And I'm running from there
I'm ready for the fans, I'm ready for the fame to save me
I'm ready for the fans, I'm ready for the fame to save me
I'm ready for the fans, I'm ready for the fame to save me
[Eminem]
Yeah, it's the soul of rap, is can you even say goodnight)
Cause at the end of the day we're just like you and I and you fool
Can you put a dollar figure on the relationship between us?
Clear picture, I'm not trying to argue, it's just this fuckin' holiday
And I'm free to go about my day, just like I don't have to spend a dollar
Somewhere in between these homes, someplace, somewhere, it's not like I'm alone
It's a fact, there's people all over the place who just know what it's like to be together
People who know what it's like to be with their dogs, man I'm so tickled by it
I love it when I tell 'em, they know that I ain't scared, I'm so glad that I came along
It gives me an adrenaline rush, it's like Iognent myself, as soon as I sit down
I just am, well yeah man, I'm so
====================
If you don't like it, you can suck my dick instead
Or you can hit me with your own vile vile vile
and just fuck off, you can suck my dick anyway
You don't like it, fuck me over
I give you my hands like a man and drop my hat
If you don't like it, you can suck my dick instead
Or you can hit me with your own vile vile
and just fuck off, you can suck my dick anyway
Guess who's back, back again, again and again
Shady and Mr. G-Unit,
We tough, no humor, no love
This is Mr. G-Unit, back as the g-unit acrobatic armada
And No-Man style, with his bay-bay-bat, his kamikaze ferris wheel
And when it comes to myoho-jiminem, this is the motto stuck right here
So opposition is futile, witness the opposition is deaf as hell
We wait and they respond with nothing but lies
But no hoes, they don't stink as I do
But if you like it, you can have it and we gon
Pick the side we feel is the most fun
The side that you don't like
And we'll let you ruin turn the tables on you
And if you don't like it, you can get it and we're gon
Kick it, gon pick the side that you don't like
And we'll let you ruin turn the tables on you
And if you don't like it, you can get it and we're gon
Kick it, we're gon kick it, we're gon kick it
See we really do what we do, don't like it
Like fuck it, we gon put it out
Know that we really do what we do, fuck it
And we gon put it out
It's our history told you
You don't like it
But don't miss it
We ain't that crazy
We're gonna make history with this new record
And we ain't gon take long to write the best new song
We gots the buzz and we gots the platinum
So bye for now, know that we really do what we do, we gon
Kick it, and we're gon make history with it
And we ain't gonna let no one tell us, no MC not the son
We gots the girl gon find out
Now she loves me, now she kiss me, now she adores me
And when I lay here with my head up in the chamber, I just wanna get away from her,
She loves me, now she kiss me, I just wanna get away from her,
I'm getting tired of her, she loves me
I'm getting tired of fucking me, kiss me
I'm getting tired of her, he loves me
I'm getting tired of her, he's so loved
He wants her neck, he loves me even when I'm gone
He said he'd make me famous, he's bored of me
He said he wants to make me fall in love with him too, he's distant
Said heatesworth, wardrobe, perverted
Hovering head skyward at speed approaching desert
I glimpse my evil deeds, past and present at once
I smother my sorrow inside a can of gasoline
He turns around and grins wicked, I'll never beat him
He smacks my face, then he turns back to the past
I see his evil ways, past and present at once
I turn around and take his place, past and present at once
I see his evil ways, past and present at once
I see his evil ways, past and present at onceAlright, listen up! You can listen to this on demand if you just want it
But without the love, you wouldn't be who you are, right?
Listen up, now! You can rewind time, Monica Lewinsky
And now you can even rewind when you were kids, it's still just you, me
Me, you know, now tell me why you do what you do
Why you act this way, why you this way
Why you see other people's kids, me too
Me, Dresden, me under the stairs again
Under the stairs again, you are now about to find out
Under these stairs, lurid tale begins
Under these stairs, lurid tale begins to sell
Under these and all these, my friends, is the truth
My little brother, he needs his mom more than me
Under these and all these, my friends, is the truth
My little brother, he's needin' his mom more than me
Under these and all these, my friends, is the truth
My little brother, he's needin' his mom more than me
Under these and all these, my friends, is the truth
My little brother, he's need
====================
I'm not a wizard but I can make you lose yourself inside everything I make, and leave you with the same misplacedness that I had, and the same misplacedness that I got when Lex Luger was my manager
[Verse 5: Kuniva]
I'm tired of all you little hoes, all you fags, trying to remind me that you ain't no longer fucking with me
That's why I'm standing here with you and you couldn't stop me I'm mad that I feel
Cause y'all fuckin' with me, I'm a piece of fucking that
I fucking hate you, fucking with me, yeah girl
Tell Angelina Jolie I'mma still breastfeeding me
That I'm still having an abortion, bitch
So stop chasing the money
You better save face, or I'm gonna blow up
And I'mma be, the centerpiece of the family
And cut fucking the fucking f***ing pillows off
Girl, don't do what you did do to Kim and Rain and Soul For Real (Roth Roamin')
I'm just a regular guy who just wants to be famous
And I don't really care, all I care about is Bizarre's money
And don't give a shit what you say
All you fags in the world, Kim and Rhonda gotta save it
Da-dang! (Oh my God!) I'm done with y'all {you amazing at this}
Yo, you really wanna talk
What's up?
Yo, I'm finished (I hang around with all you fags)
With all you dicks, stop
Stop stop (what up?)
Stop, stop (shit!)
Stop, stop (what?)
Stop, stop (to me!)
And stop (just what is it with all of you?)
I'm finished with you dicks, stop
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
I'm finished with you dicks, stop
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
I'm finished with you dicks, stop
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
I'm finished with you dicks, stop
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
[Chorus: Eminem and Royce: 4:20]
It's the only thing that makes me hate here
Every time I come to this little country,
I'm just trying to make a little buck
If you don't like it, you're in the wrong
If you like it, you're in the wrong
I come here to re-establish what the word is
To bring you something you haven't got
You can have a little puppy, a wrist, a pecton
Or a rover, you can have my autograph
Here's an X, you can give me a few words for me
I think I'm on to Young's shit right here
[Royce:]
Em what's up?
[Em]: Sup yours
I got an hour hand-out and your name in the papers
I got a dumb bitch, she wanted to flunk us
We pull her car out the driveway, push her out into the open
And I just whip her damn damn collar off!
[Royce:]
Wait! Royce said there ain't no such thing!
Okay, you mean his?
Fuck that! I mean my! My! Life!
My whole life I was made for this music
If I was still alive I would never be what you are
My mom would never be where she is
The minute that I walk in this mirror I see Grandma,
And see my angel, can you see it?
It's a little boy, your mom?
My little boy, wants to try to get out of his parents bedroom
But he can't, his father's not around so mom strips him naked
Wags is watching so mom strips him naked
Kiss my butt boy, I can't stand it, I'm trying to walk
And look how mad he's turned on TV
I hit him so he tries to get his ass naked
I swing a fat knife at him, and when it's swinging I'm swinging at Chris
And Dope whoop ass, dead dog so Ash
Put the knife to my flesh and blood and blood and beat my bitch cunt
And when I'm leaving for good I'm leaving to shoot my daughter (And beat my daughter)
With a fat mackin gun and shoot my bitch Ash
Don't ever make my my life a movie
I don't make movies,
====================
Boom, boom!
Goes one, decides the other,
Came to lead lead off,
Came to lead and I'm a loser,
Here's my karma, grip up, life's just a baggage
You crazy?
Nope!
And my wonder, is that I went to a new country,
And woke up in a different place,
And saw my karma cross over,
And started following your trail,
And started feeling like a new prisoner,
Like I was used to you, given a new set of rules
You rejected me, I love you, I have you every time,
Every single time, no matter how many times, no matter what the cost
You're gonna have people stopping to thank you, like, this
Was my mom back when people used to buy albums
You could mail your daughter a love song, 'cause there was this buzz
Around that new wave, there was this buzz
When I went to platinum, people were stopping
To buy records for me, but I'm not gonna be able to dat' 'em
So this is how I'm supposed to be, big ape
In a circle, with machine guns, machine guns
gun emcees, happy mothers
ready to take anything as long as it fits
hand on hand to fire at will
no nothin' new for me to hack at
as long as my housin' cocksucker's
is spilt in a cup, I ain't drinkin'
my mind full of loose coke, straight to the bank
machine guns at work 'cause I'm on a nigga
I can't no more stand this motherfucker
(Can I spray your face with gasoline?)
I can't no more stand this motherfucker
(I'll beat this bitch with a bat, wire, pencil, scissors)
I'm pissed off (I'm pissed off)
Cause this bitch keeps talkin' shit
about me buyin' peps at the races, so she get's her panties in a bunch
and get her panties in a bunch and go back for 'em
in a couple of minutes, I'm reclining, lookin' over my worst playa
so what the fuck do I look like, fucked up?
goddamn
what the fuck the fuck
yeah what the fuck
yo yo
yo
ok you want me to pick you the worst bitch?
pick the one you hate the most
the one you're stomach achein'
the one you're just hangin' out with
the one you're in pain in
let me ask you what the fuck
you say to me, this bitch
you say to me, this bitch
I write the most bullshit
I'll shit on you, I'll shit on you
and I got a wife that's mad at you
cause you told her you was her bitch, now you got her
blame your own ass, it's clear
she ain't caught up to the fact
that I'm here to pimp you a little
and make you take a little vacation
just to let you be here to complete this adetoc
and make you pissed off a little bit too, huh?
yo yo
you get the message
you feel bad, now you fuck around and blow your
shit, you know the deal
I got a new plan, bitch, you better respect me
and stop the club at the start of the parkin' lot
of cash denominated in U.S. dollars, you fuckin' club
that's the problem, the owners of this shit
know what I'm saying? They got problems.
There's a club here that they don't give a damn about me
I run it, they run it well, if you want to come a step further
you better come claim my here's a price
I'll beat you to this bitch with a spiked bat 'ov you ain't wanted never had a problem
here's the deal
I've been rocking the craft since '97, I'm a regular
I'm a regular MC, I don't give a fuck what you say
I'm still as crazy as Steve, in fact I'm
agin' for something more, what's the difference between me and you?
you write songs, I write raps
What you mean you can fly spaghetti Westerns with ham?
it's sandwich style, you said that you want Jay's little menager
outro:
Here's what you like
(Remix)
You know you want me baby, I like the show
You know I like the ass
The way I swing and the way I cut
the f-ck off before I kill myself
On the recording of my song
aftermath, and I don't wanna think about what goes next
and I'm not trying to seem pedantic,
====================
In the box with a magnifying glass
A look through the till
(Yo she's only 5'9, I'm 5'9")
Yo she got teckles, gettin pink, gettin sore
(Leaving her pinkie toe), I'm outta my skin cream
I'm doin a 360 on the freeway
Yo she's so swift
I wonder where the cops was comin
I almost died
I flip my Jonas's off the handle
They found my ring fob on the freeway
I'm tryna get my daughter to swallow
Bitch-ass is gettin kids off their pail with no help
From jail to buy them P.O. checks
Yo cops toe dimes and dimes of my chain
Is this dude from Detroit or is this some other guy
Pick your nose up off jail,
While I'm takin a stroll through the park
In Target and get robbed three times
I'm in a white Porsche with two ladies
At a bar in North Hollywood
Poppers stopin and friskin my car
While I'm takin a walk in the jewelry section
And walk up Fifth Ave.
In Walmart parking lot
Then I'mront of 3 cops escorting a wanted man
Choppers stopin and friskin my car
While I'm takin a minute to reflect
I'ma be apprehended for this crime!
Yo man, I can hear the sound of these pops
Breaking, and I flee the scene with a flagpole
And keep my zipper down, it's emcees
Denise Raymond and Justin Bieber
I'm got a {big dick} and I'll smack em if
I felt any need to remind them that I don't give a fuck
Money is the devil, I'm just a bitch with a big booty
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like, (I'll)
Shady (Choppers rave)
I'm renegades, they left me with a {rotten} egg
It was on purpose, to sneak me in a pinch
To grab a bigger quantity of em' when I drop to earth
(I'll)
And just when I'm up in Mississippi
(I'll)
Don't waste my precious breath, it's all or nothing
(I'll)
Don't be da-da's fool, she's fuckin' ho
Oh, she's so fuckin' beautiful
Lookin' like Jessica Alba in a manger, Freddie
(I'll)
Fell off like cheap fry cookers
They sit on my thighs for twelve hours or
"Lay me out on the flat surface, please"
Sittin' on plastic that's non-toxic
That's hazardous, because when I'm pissed off
I'm pissed off, man, and I'm pissed
At something, that something, ain't got to be fixed
It has to be, fixed, and you
Have to hold it up for them to catch up
(I'll)
To catch up to 20 years from now (I'll)
Be in a position to catch up to my career
But I'm 'bout to rewind that window
And see what I'm cause is my only source of light
Until my career is ruined, then and I guess
I'ma do some hard things today, and tomorrow
I might be out of gas, time-displaced
Somebody turn the lights off
Just to listen to my dreams, I guess
I'ma wallow in fumes, my life is like a Pit and Bull
Ring, buddy? My head's throb, I'm outta gas
I need a bit of this "lift"
I'ma be outta inhumane
Beat the piss outta me
I am, simply, not
(I'll)
No, I don't know, maybe I just do
No, no
I'm still standin' here screamin'
No I'm not, bleeding in my screams
I'm just screamin' in my mind
No-one, no one, no God
I'm going to Hell
I'm pent up, I'munstuck
In a house full of captors
If I'm to be free
If I'm to be my demons
Then I'm Free As Me
I'll take a look
Then I'll walk around the house with a creeping loathing
And all I hear is is distant footsteps
Whose knife's aimed straight for my lungs?
Heart throb, lungs throb, lungs are open
Open, no doubt
Why can't you hear my voice?
Comes the cry of a soul
A bullet riddled house
With the crawlspace up its basement
But I unpack my bags
Comes the courage
The bravery
The choice
The choice
You can be me
Or
====================
Oh man you look mincing words
I suppose I'm grown, but I'm still radio, hey
My chips are off, yo chips off
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass up
My teenyeans are the ones that got it wit the thong
If you don't like it you can get tits as large as your lap
And if you don't like it, you can get that dice and my probation
And yo you get your ass kicked, but I ain't gone kiss his ass
You can get your ass up for a spin, that's all
You can do is walk away, that's all
I love what I do, I got so much appeal
My cup runneth over now, I'm a rush to bottling
My brain is empty without you, its full of unemployed people
(No I'm sorry Kim)
My dick is sore now, I got all horny, I'll kick you in the nuts
My future is scary, I'm a spook
I'm a spook, you catch me just don't wanna admit it
I'm a spook, you don't wanna admit it
You and your close, my honey, I'm a spook
We stand before the gazetticle, over your head with your left foot
We stand before the gazetticle, and jab at you with our index and pinky fingers
Walk the block right behind you, sniffin' you breakfast, your breakfast
Before you be spooked, I'm right here to give you some head and stimulate you to think
I stand before you like a spider, with a peg in his web
I watch you struggle, through this storm, just to get your morning cup of coffee
(Yeah right, girl, I'm the man to get you up)
I'm like the Mosberg, the giant, the cross between a judge and a man
I take you back to the future, and I let you become something more than a baby to me
I'm the future, your baby to me
I'll cut you off from the rest of the world, forever
Ianish, Shady brothers, a tragedy
Daddy's here to save you, I don't understand, I hope you stay
These motherfuckers can't fuck with me, I'm a spook

If you want to chase after flames, flame out
This pixie leaf goes every time
Girl flame it out
If you want to get in them grillin', then so be it
Ja quit playing, you little homo, he ain't no good
I hope you get tomorrows
in less than a second
before this shit gets loaded on stilts
And you all get smacked
and dropped off at the door with this shit
From all over the world, where bushwhacking is fun
And if you take a bow the fuck outta this
You're a globula, a slut and you drop
shit bitch I'm out the, telling a thousand people
What it was like to be a fuckin' underdog
in the face of really shitty, real Americans
I'm a rollin' cover, you heard me
When shit is screwed up or fucked up, always be out
The shady, the cracka's for the shady
Don't ever give me shit for stupid shit
I know it's happening
But you better hope you're kidding
You and your ex-wife
Yeah, that's pretty cool man
Yeah, and I hope that they find out how fucked up I amamn
I hope they find out how late I'm in the club
I hope they know I'ma coming home
I hope they didn't find out after they fuck me
I hope they okay man they just broke up
I hope they know I don't like them both
I hope they know after they fuck me
I hope they say they're never together
I hope they know after they fuck me
I hope they know I don't like them both
I hope they know they're never together
I hope they know I'm a bitch
A bitch, a cunt, yeah, I'm a mess,
Fuckers breakup was rough, but I'm back for the taking
I got problems, yeah, I'm busting them off in his English
Thats like Abraham Lincoln with a branding iron
In his hand is on his mic, is where I'm at
I'm up early, I'm set to go, Paddington
[Paddington]
[Eminem & Lil Wayne]
Let's make a mixtape about your life through your eyes
You live through the prism you use to see
You replace the white trash demon
With a fucking cypher, you'll be the same after
Testing your shoulder tolling up the fuck up the place
Overreacting to shit, that's why you don't like me
[50 Cent]
Came home, you don't like this, I replacing the good ol' old me
With a 50 Cent, Threw it down with her, she spit spit it
Leave you feeling like a family
You can't blame me, I'm on a mission with Eve
I want the White House, I want the botox, I'm running the country
Man, I'm so glad that you're alive and well
I'm causing so much pain, and I don't mean to damage you
So please stand up, and put your hands up, for I'm coming
Kick back, while I do my stretches, just relax, take a lap, relax, take a breather
I'm just letting you know that, while you're feeling them, I'm animin'
Fuck a nigga, sitting down, walking around speaking
I ain'tch havin' no quarter, so don't act like a fan
[50 Cent]
Just letting you know, that you're man and that you're man
[Eminem]
Just letting you know, that you're man
[Chorus]
I'm running up outta nowhere, feeling like a runner
Startling rays, like a tyrannasaurus
Out of control for the past, you know what I'm saying?
Coming straight out the top of my lungs
Right before your very own eyes
We're the illest MC's out there
And I'mma be forever pissed off
Cause every time I wake up, this dopest thing I can be a part of
I'm gonna do anything to make you scratch and itch for this deamony, get some more
Mouth Dre, I'mma always been this way
I dive in head first, and how come we don't know each other?
And we don't even know each other's a felony
We been doing this since high school, we both graduated
Fuck it, I only got a year and a half to live, before I was laid off
I've been to Libya, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Central America
Niggas still use the word 'bitch' 'I'm cute with a dumb bitch', niggas mad
Just like how you and I switched sizes and grew legs
Hope you and I never see eye to eye, cause that's
====================
in the media while I'm screaming in a bunch of sudden noises
While I'm extending my arms out
I don't need you anymore
I'mma give up, I'mma end my career
Fell off, cliffhanger than I'm hollerin' in a voice
Asked whether or not he was sorryin'
That he coulda did nothing to stop the massacre at Sandy Hook
And rip the comics off him and rip the page out
When he felt he was lost, and everything he had
Sandy Hook, that's when they let him in
But don't make him kill the creator yet
You said that you was sorry
That he coulda done nothing to stop the massacre at Sandy Hook
And rip the comics off him and rip the page out

Yo Shady, I miss you Shady!
Ha ha, miss you!
Fullmetal Alchemist, yes, yes metal, yes metal
So you can as a man, as a man
I respect the way that I'm approaching this
I respect the way that I'm approaching this
Fuck it, I'm a little bit of a private soul
With a little bit of An Tubby in my bowels, come on yo
I want you to look so ridiculous in a blink of an eye
It kinda makes you feel like I stole your soul
Girl, wouldn't you know it's fake
From the first, to the last album, no pants, no
Fuck it, I'm a soldier, fuck it I'm a soldier,
I'll hold it down for like an instant,
See like I'm trying to ponder what it'd be like to ride with
Robin on my dick, hard as I try to keep it closed
Should be obvious though, asses
When I drop the technology, I'm fuckin' the Mechanical
Fuck my brain, into hyperdrive, my dicks explode
Like a Vodka beverage, jacked like a spiked bat
Brain wasted, psycho wasted, I'll never get the job done
Motherfuckers treat me like I'm The Incredible Hulk
Try to act like I'm some hooligan, there's a problem
Bitch, I'm the Golden State, Earl Threwer
Hooligan, there's a problem, there's a problem
Bitch, shut up bitch! Shut up! You want me to come and break up the shit down for you?
You got us down, there's no way I'm gonna let down my guard
And you really fucked me up when you didn't even bother to answer my questions
Quit fucking sitting down, what are you?
Is you fucking with me? You think I understand?
Coming up, it's like a routine checkup
The dungeons like a doctor checking your veins
It's like the main source of income
You get a raise cause your heart's racing, you need a machine
Connect Gary Dias to the grid and we'll bring him
Robin Thicke, you know what you say when you say it
You got me mistaken son, I'm a stone cold ruthless
I can't even load up a map on a h
====================
Guess who stood in line at the hospital when I came? Kim Osario
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who you gotta say is something that you're about to share with the world?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who you gotta say is something that you're about to share with the world?
Guess who?
You know, I knew it, when I went into the room with you and you and walked over to the mirror and said, "I want this mirror, I want this set of arms, and this watch."
And you looked at that picture, and then you got mad and walked over and stuck your tongue in his jaw, and he was gonna have that issue taken out, and bowgged him.
And I said to you, "What?"
You didn't know that giving someone else's disease isn't just stealing, and it's making you angry.
And I know that a lot of people don't know that I had this thing going on in my heart, but I had my temper, and I made them people's predicatley, things got out of control, and I made them by giving a second thought, and I'm sorry if you think I'm nice, just hate on me.
And also, you know, I'm not going to sit here and write a shitty letter, with a tiny little hand, just trying to sum up a country, just consider this for a moment.
So I'm sorry, if I think about it, almost four years, I'm still here.
(BANG!)
So this is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan back in the day shit ewolla'd at him, shitbluntin him.
You probably never heard, but I'm Mr. Friendly, on your mama's mic.
Okay, alright then.
VERSE 1
Ain't trying to be mean or mean
I just wanna get off the bus then
To get to the studio now
Let me stab you in the back with a dull bat
Here, little lassos, blow your brains out
Puss blew your brains out when you was young
Did you just say them niggas that are talkin' that shit?
Now what you say?
It's just a small sampling of the shit I throw at you
The masks on, little wooden balls, when I talk
I was bowling with my tightest victim
In the dirtbag bandage, and your man Joe Budden
Walkin' up in a place in the world that's quite literally a foot and a half away
And when I'm asked what you can and can't say
From all the trouble that I've been in
Tellin' in the face of fuckin' I've been through it
And what you can't do, what you can do, what you can't say
I'm back, talk about I'm in the dirtbag bandage
Til' I come back into the room and there's no-one else around
You're tied up, cut off, and bleeding all over the dance floor
Are you stupid? Are you stupid?
Cause you can't do what you did, or should I say should've
Had sex with that girl, but you shitted on me, fuck man
Were you fucking with my intentions?
Every accusation, every innuendo
Should've been 'cause you're the one that I've been jealous of
Fuck you, I'll do anything for you, fuck Sam?
Fuck you, I'll fuck you up
Fuck you, I'll do anything for you, fuck Sam?
Fuck you, I'll do anything for you, fuck Sam?
Fuck you, I'll do anything for you, fuck fuck fuck
I'll put you through? You shook, with bruises on my arms
Fuck, with knife wounds on my backs, I'm jealous of you
Yeah, that's right, fuck Sam, fuck you for doubting me
Yeah, fuck you for fucking question
Rabbit run!
Bitch, I'll go through this, fuck Rabbit, I'll go through this
I'll explain it to you, when we come to it
But I wanted you to know that, for me to get boy-girl ass was impossible
I had to get there, I had to get that boy-girl ass, in no time at all
I fucking got to wait, I got to get there, man I can't wait
I just got to be "E" in this bitch, boy I can't wait
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to tell you?
I'm not an American,
====================
Encore:
I don't know what inspired me to start out with
I knew I wanted to write a song here
About a superlative man who will ever live to regret it
That's why I'm so misunderstood and why I'm at my wits' end
What he chose to do, is overdose on prescription painkillers
He may be wrong but his actions bring me closure
I came to the concept with spontaneous passion
I write with a purpose, no one else has
I look up, I sit and pretend to be bored
I hours an hour, on the clock, on this bored air
I sit and fantasize, how I could be wrong
I sit and fantasize, I might just make a nice wife
And I'm willing to give is life
And I sit and fantasize, why I've got so many women
I lay awake in bed next to them saying things
That I don't understand what's happening
Is it just another dream, or am I dreaming?
Is this some dream I'm having with another woman?
Are there sleeping pills in my bed?
Do you know why I'm here?
Is it because of what I am?
Am I dreaming?
Am I just a madman who's being deceitful?
Dear Slim, you are, and you are
I'm here to save the day
To save the world, with a bunch of crazier shit
I learned the hard way Yes I am, and you are
Fuck around and get annihilated
And have a heart attack and find me on the bathroom floor
And not put em down, they still yell at me
If you alive, man, you won't retaliate
But until then, I'll beat you to death
Are you insane? You're porcuputed with liquid?
You're wack, you're insensitive, you're cocky?
I ain't scared of nothing anything bad that I can come up with
So then what comes up that big ass prick when I eat him?
That was probably the closest thing to a hug I ever got
When I was young, when you were closer to each other
You got a brother and a father
But you're not, are you?
I don't know, I've had enough of your shit
'Cause I'm fuckin' crazy
Fuckin' homo', what you know about fuckin' with Tony?
Tony's a tough nigga, he's black, he's complex
And I got a beautiful wife, but she's just bein' soams
I don't think she understands that I love her
And if she does, I'm a kill you motherfucker
She gon' say "I don't like you, go sing"
I ain't mad, I ain't mad
I got a huge dick, but I'm too small to rock bigals
If you fuck with me, I'm gonna chip your ass
And force you to fuck me myself
I don't do this shit just to get paid
I use it as a smokeshow, get popped
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
DDD, up close, 'em both, you know you're a couple
Me and Shady, down below, I'm like down below
Your flow is stopping, my livers stop
I'm like a liquor bottle with a little bit of booze in it
DDD up close, 'em both, I'm like down below
Your flow is stopping, my livers stop
I'm like a liquor bottle with a little bit of booze in it
I get up, I down below in the studio
Down below in a room full of death
And see what the hell I do next, I got a plan
I sit with Shady and leave it to him like this is all that it takes
Probably makes me the first super-duper talented rapper
To go through four separate presidents and have four different camps
On the same album, it doesn't matter who your friends are
Cause everybody knows Eminem is a monster
Everybody knows Shady is a rapper, everybody knows what a killer is
Everybody knows Reek, everybody knows Rhymes (what a mouth)
Me and Shady, down below, I'm like down below in the studio
So who's it gotta be? Just a coincidence that my song "Never Gathers" has gotten this much media
And come to so many people's amusement parks, country house parties
And this is it?
My sorrow echoes in every cell of this building
Like the echo chamber that you say you came from
Where I store the power chords, and the rhythm guitar parts
The gloomy future is
====================
I got an axe, y'all just got dull
Keep chopping, ya'll don't fuck me up short
Keep drinking more vodka then I've had e'er
Enough vodka whores to say fuck my daughters names off
I got an axe, y'all just got dull
Keep chopping, ya'll I ain't shit with ya
Prepare yourself for the most competitive
I ain't here to fight for you, I'm here to save you
I ain't here to see blood, guts and pain
I'm here to shoot up your bar, and I ain't pissed at you
I ain't here to see a soldier die by hypochondria
I'm here to see you mushroom and get fucked up
In a jig, then I'll erase that shit and put it back in
My brain's not as fine as ceramic
I'm just fine, I'm just tired of being pissed
I'm tired of being pissed, let me see you puke
Wake up in someone's face and fuck them both up
Is that a dead rottweiler or a dead rottweiler
Let me see you wee, this is your bar, go ask Mathers
A dead rottweiler, what's it got you qualms about it?
A dead rottweiler, you get the fuck out the house, quick
A couple of kicks to the stomach, some smack, some stab
Jigger, stab you in the back, well shuckin'
A couple of kicks to the groin, some stab
Fuck you feel me, feel me raw, in the streets of Compton
I'll stab you in the back, niggas catchin' this shit, quick
Shady put the fucking knife away he's never had it so he don't give me he none
(Faggot)
Painkillers, johnson's in the trunk, niggas got hands on him
And that's pretty much the picture you get
Of a man killed for gay, that's news to me
You kill my son, I'll fuck you up
In fact, fuck you up, and scatter like D-Bo Tie-Dye
So while you're out ricocheting, just look at the frizdizzle
(Faggot)
To the blind young lady in the corner trying to swipe
Some cash, blow it all off her like check blow
To the gay pride rally, where the fuck is Donald?
To his face, stand up, look him in the eyes
Where's his racist leanin', there's no such thing
As a white boy trying to make a buck off of it
So rally right there, tell 'em, black people
Know that rap's never gonna be the same if you actin'
As yourself and Soulja Boy, the future is rhyme
With the right motherfuckin' name, writegin' up the charts
With the right rap name, writegin' up the charts
The future is black and white, the past is gravy
And the past is nothing, up to and fro the
New York Philharmonic, the past is brought to you
Every issue there's an eight-page obituary
And the president of the school, calling you a liar
To hell, I'm closing in with a five-year, you better
You never sung like a man enough to rock the boat
And you better land,fo
Royce Da 5-9, Joe Budden, you can't land
Yo, I like your piss-poor attitude
I'll settle a lawsuit, you better show some respect
I'll settle one, I'll settle the next
I like pissants, I'll settle vendettas
You'll get your ass kicked, me fin-nana
By the way, what's your favorite N-U-land?
My N-U-land is the fuckin' N-U-land
The fuckin' U-S-A-U-Voo
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I wont back down
Oh no I wont back down
Oh no
Alright, listen-up, here's my second album
I'm lying, liar oh god no
Here's my third album
There's three arches, a palace, a dungeon
And a prison, and I love the public address systems
Yeah, the politics of hate in a day/night cycle
Are you ready to be bombed?
Off the fucking newsstand, blowing up 'till your mama bleary-eyed
Somebody pinch me, please, I'm bombin' you, punch you in the face
Oh, where's D-R-E in an hour where I slap you, kick you in the ribs?
Floatin' in Times
====================
I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a person who's able to communicate
With his fans through his skin, and through his rhymes
I can reach a whole generation of baby's out of these terrace living
In the flesh like a fucking spider's web, you wonder how
Do I send these messages myself, I don't think
There's too many on my radar, 'cause
There's too many on my radar, 'cause
You couldn't make the case for yourself if you didn't go Michael Jackson shit
And you're not even on my radar, I'm just a regular guy
You fucking are, you're a fucking puppet, I'm Michael Jackson with a belt
And I'm so fucking insane
I can sense it, I can feel it, it's in your souls, running through your souls
Your souls, your souls, your souls, your souls
Its like I'm ripping off your trachea
You're not, fucking with me, I'm listening
And I feel compelled to state here my case for being the most stupid bitch I've ever had in my entire life
And fucking leave the rap game alone, I'm not gonna make a single case
And leave it alone, I'm not gonna make a single case
So listen closely, cause this might give you an idea of just what you're missing
'Cause I'm just a regular guy, I'm just fucking with you
You're fucking with me, man.
I just want to make you aware of the bullshit you're trapped in
And there's a couple of things you can take from this
I may be wrong, but I'm not letting up
I think I've calmed down a little
You're not dealing with the real shit here
You want to get personal, man
I just wish you the best of luck getting back to me
And I hope you get the chance to do what I do best:
D-12!
[Dr. Dre]
Alot of people ask me, like Dr. Dre just turned 26
Now I'm a old man, so I don't have as many M-16s to turn to
But I do have a couple of D-12's, a couple of C96's, a couple of Porter Brothers
And a couple of Sig Sauer P-P 90's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's(check it out)
(Eminem)
Man, I wish Eminem luck with that C96's
I think it's the best thing I can do for him
Is get him to walk me off stage, and leave me a voicemail, saying I just love him
And I can go anytime I want, and whenever I want, and leave you a new record
You know what, I still call em, White Rabbit, Green Bitch.
(Green Bunny)
I still call em, White Rabbit.
(Eminem)
I still love em, but its a fact
Every time I hear a new song that I'm having trouble to snap
I take a breath, I'm taking a hit, I'm praying now I'm praying
I'm stead up, I gotta cut the cord, I need a drink, I'm pissin'
(Talking of pissin)
Man I'm done playing with you, you're a fuckin' joke
(Talking of pissin)
I done stripped you of your freedom, you won't even let me play
You're a fag on tour, I ain't gonna let you out this
You're gonna fear me like all the neighbors fear Shady
Why you cryin', I ain't gonna tell you
Why I'm pissin' off this fuckin with this on his turntables
I'm pissed off for the life of me, but God just shook me
Now I got this crowd that's been screaming like, "S***, S***, S***"
I don't care how many people runnin' in the show, I still win
People get punched in the face, I'm takin' their gold
And your man just blinkin' and give a thumbs up, but I'm pissed
Sure is, but I'm takin' your seat, my dick is small
(chours)
People know that I'll never be Marshall Mathers
I'm a, I, a liar 'till I'm a
F*** 'til I'm a, pass you
====================
I'm a soldier, you catch me all havin' a story
And you want me to start shooting at you soldiers? Shoot!
Like shootin' your moms, your soldiers
Like shootin' your moms, your soldiers
Like startin' to self-destruct
Like I'm startin' to self-destruct
Like I'm so glad
That you came to the table, cause I was startin' to self-destruct
Like I was respectin' me cause I was me
Startin' to self-destruct
Like I'm so glad
That you came to the table, cause I was startin' to self-destruct
Like I was me
Startin' to self-destruct
Like I was me
Startin' to self-destruct
Like I was me
The generic version is that I don't give a fuck, then I kill
And bury my fuckin' corpse in the mud
While you duck behind the counter try to wash your whitie's
And the back of my mighty Van De Kamp's
While you duck behind the counter try to wash your whities
I'm a soldier, you catch me all havin' a story
And you want me to tell it? Shoot!I told you I was cops love you, I just can't do it,
Take a night off, come back, shoot me again, f*** me again,
Was I too busy? Nope!(Eminem)
What?
I don't know, I'm too high
High in the morning, I'm too mad
At work, I told my boss I'm going back
'Cause I'm trying to get my ass out of bed
I'm not gonna lie, I'm flattered
And that's just great cause I'm sad
'Cause I don't think you're ready for the spotlight
I know that you feel the same way, Dave
I know that you feel just like I feel
All the pride, you're so young, I hope you grow up to be that man
And fuse in with us and be that man
And fuse in with us and be that man
And then when we grow up, we'll see
What the fuck you down lady?
[Chorus]
I'm going to kill this bitch with a meat cleaver
Shit, I'm going to jail
Ain't no reason I wasn't given
That I can't give you an erection, how about that?
"I can't you see that I'm a pathetic, pathetic prick"?
You bet your ass I am!
See what these boobs' stink? Man these boobs stink!
You must be off your rocker
The fact that you can't see through
You must be fucking indecisive
Man there's really not that many of us
Who's in this fight for the soul of the band
'? ? 'Cause we, are!
'? ? 'Cause we're!
'? ? 'Cause we're!
'? ? 'Cause we're!
'? ? 'Cause we're!Ladies and gentlemen
You are now about to witness the power of hindsight
I will have you pegged as a sociopath,
And you'll recall me as a crank
'Cause I pitiable as a cranium
And I'm a cranium filled with remorse
For the mistakes I've made,
And I'm averse to hindsight
'Cause I see it all, yeah, see it go
Pistol poppin', I'm past my prime
Now my prime is gone, I'm past my mark
There's no reason that I can think of to call it
Blame on Haley and Charles for their sins
They tried to snatch me from under me
I've entered a phase, a manic, in which I
Feel like I'm on the edge, my temper's not willing to budge
It's like they tried to snatch me from under me
Baby, show me love, is that your penis?
We're gonna fuck you tube, then?
I can't wait!
Ha ha, Nate Dogg
You're no kidding, you go to church and sex
And you get a little bit crazy, right? I'm the wankth
I'm gonna tear up your fuckin' house up, and leave you with a bang
'Cause I'm gonna fuck you up, and leave you with a bang[Verse: Eminem (Paul Rosenberg/Sway)]
You have no business being president
And joining the navy, where the wars really start you
Leavin' a lot of dough, runnin' for public office, and lose
Your soul for tryin' to run against me [laughter]
I've been a father
To a premature he was stillbirth, and now I'm a son
[Chorus: Eminem (Psychologic Art] + Verse 2)]
I'm
====================
I'm gonna kill this shit right here
My homie just started laughing and joking right now
And God I'm so joking my father's like
"What the fuck have you brought? You have to get off this shit!"
My mother goes out in a show to get her doughnuts
And takes a couple of dumb pictures right now
With this script, and I take a couple of odd flicks
But when she's at it, I forget everything that she says
Like I'm Shirley Chisholm in the Mamma Mia!
Man if I only had one half of a mouth
One half would say they were good and the other half wouldn't listen
The other half of you would try to be nice
Inface me in a song with the bad shit and the good shit
And you're like "That boy's a fag"
And I'm like "That's a big mistake"
And you're right "Yeah but boy you rock the boat"
It's like you're saying fuck you to these niggas who say the same shit
But you ain't fuckin' moms,itans,bodies or anything like that "I'm the D would you like me?"?"
I'm not, I'm not Judeo-Christian
And I'm also not, like, me personally
But whatever, I'm just a human being with a few biblical verses in his bible
And I was put on this earth to make the world learn
That sometimes things just have to be told, that it's just words, that it's just a
Yo this is for the children 1-6
You may listen but don't listen
Eminem: VERSUS THE FREE WORLD
VERSUS NIGGAS
I got no time to sit around and preach
But I got one wish
Would show him how to properly represent me
Underground in me
VERSUS NIGGAS
I got no time for sit around and preach
I'm gonna close this letter with a toast to the good news
I ain't here to talk about Alana, I'm gonna treat this topic
Like a friend, treat this subject like a relative
And see what kind of a disastrous turn that I'm gonna take
This world is mine for the taking
Man, I'm gonna be the bad ass one
Don't give me no bullshit
Give me one more "Thank you for the support"
and if you ask me too
I'm gonna be the one you ask me
For my turn to desert
And if you wonder where I'm goin
Gonna be in the afterlife
But I'm tellin you right now
I'm magin it, I'm magin it, I'm magin it
I'm gonna be the one you ask me for one more minute
You find me offensive, offensive
I'm finally time to be even slightly offensive
I might even be the first rapper to actually believe that
I'm a demi-goddamn fucking bomb
Met with the wrath of the devil, some who take asphyxiation in
Air
Eminem: VERSUS NIGGAS!
Eminem: FUCKING FREE WORLD!
VERSUS NIGGAS!
I'm gonna be the bad guy
My bad, I'm gonna be the nice guy
VERSUS NIGGAS!
I'll shit on you, shit on you
VERSUS NIGGAS!I should start crying, shit I'm just cryin
I'm so tired of bein followed
As I run G's like a dog ran straight through a fan
Here's a t-shirt I can wear to any fuckin Show, punk or Monopoly
Fan, fightin Aftermath is shit, it's all or nothing, it's all or nothing
I'm so tired of being stared at, surrounded by this evil gaze
That I wish that I could just leave it alone, I just wish that I could answer you
But I'm so tired of being stared at, that I wish that I could just say
That I know it's not to be, I'm so tired of being stared at
And told everything you gotta do to get in my heads, that I can be your friend
Can't have it both ways, I'm so tired of this life and this job
That I'm gonna give you my own singer, not your own artist
No one's so precious, I'm leaving the mic at the door
You fuck this shit up, I'm leaving you in the dirt
Mixin' and mastering your own music, what you own?
So you don't own mine, you own mine
My homeboy, my mom, my grandmother, my mom
All grown, and I'm still a baby, too
I own a fucking mansion, a fucking Rolls-Royce
Dalat, who'd a brother take? Ooh,
====================
You can find me in the bar
Or I'm getting harassed by these hoes (one of them)
I'm paranoid, I might just snap and start shit on fire
My hatred for you may seem understandable
But take into consideration the fact that I live a lifetime of being this harassed
Even if it means spitting at you
I got a huge collection of phishing emails with the subject line "Say Thank You!"
And I just got sued, you know what I say?
I told you I would never try to squash that
Shit, I almost killed Dre and Eminem, and sued them both
Yeah, aie-bye, sue me!I'm a psycho, I'm a psychopath, I'm a liar
I said I got it, I got it, too, and I still get it
(Like a "fuck you" isopropyl alcohol, benzabis, chronic)
Put this tape on your refrigerator and freeze it
Cut off any further flow, I'm not even gonna try to come and fight in person
Cos this is my Earth, man
I'm a fuckin' motherfuckin' planet, man
I'm a fuckin' motherfuckin' planet,
I said I got it, I got it, too, and I still get it
(Like a "fuck you" isopropyl alcohol, benzabis, chronic)
Put this tape on your refrigerator and freeze it
Cut off any further flow, I'm not even gonna try to come and fight in person
Cos this is my Earth, man
I'm a fuckin' motherfuckin' planet, man
I said I got it, I got it, too, and I still get it
(Like a "fuck you" isopropyl alcohol, benzabis, chronic)
Put this tape on your refrigerator and freeze it
(chorus)
I got a psychopathic combination of opiates, insane eating and sleeping
Driving with my 17-year old daughter, she thinks she's getting murdered
'Cause I slap her forefinger in the air, and watch her rewind it
Throw her in the ground with a built-in swerve
That'll tee it up if I ever leave the game
Without giving my daughter the benefit of the doubt
I would have never got the time or the patience
To learn how to coach a small, smart football team
Without breakin' in dumb places, all over the playground
'Cause every snap, I'min' back at the same time
So set the record straight, sister
[Chorus]
You already knew, from the beginning
What would happen if I did a song with Swift
I would be aiming for the things you see in her
You see in her, see how you spin her
See in her, see how you spin her, how she spins
Would be a crime, be murder, be manslaughter
What if she was just a lil bit of a tease
You already knew, from the beginning
What would happen if I did a song with Swift
I would be aiming for the things you see in her
You see in her, see how you spin her
See in her, see how you spin her
I just wanted to make sure that she knew I was coming
And that I knew that I was still working
The art of the chase, kid
I just wanted to make sure that she knew that I was working
Say goodbye, Say goodbye, to the streets that matter
Say goodbye, to the gimmicks
Say goodbye, to the hip hop that matters
Say goodbye, to the history of hip hop
Say goodbye, to the whole "S" from "E"
To say the least, homie I'm 'spinning' the whole "L" for "S"
From "The Firm" to "The Wire" to "The Octo"
I want the ground to spin, I'm not afraid (yeah)
And I got a brand new bag of toys for your hands to spin
Believe me, we having a party (We having a party (We have a party (We have a party (We have a party (We have a party (We have a party (Have a party (It's time to party) It's time to party) It's time to party) It's time to party)
Y'all are runnin' so hard
My soul's escaping, my head is about to explode
I'm trying to squeeze, but I can't squeeze enough
I got a lot of young children's hair on my ass
I told you I'm very nice
And I don't really care what you say
I got a million songs to cover
I got a million albums in the bag
And I got a lot of shoes to use
Mic check? No, check, check
The questions are stupid
You're just playing to yourself
'Cause
====================
It's like a dream, you wake up, I wake up
With a crazy morning, late at night, like light years away
But we're not friends, cause we both dreamt
That we, could never be, you know what I'm saying?
Think of me as a foil, I'm just jealous
Cause I started off with a blank stare and
Over time got slightly more empathetic, you know?
Think of what you say when you say it, shit
Talk of me dissin' Flipboard, shit
I come to everything, you try to turn me down
We can hate, but we can't judge
We can never be the same, shit
If I stay single bitch, shit I could use a lil' man,
Picture me holding a brick, shit
Picture me wigglin' like Dexter, shit
Picture me wigglin' like Walk the St.
Picture me wigglin' more socks, you know what I'm sayin'?
Picture me wigglin' more dough, you know what I'm sayin'?
You shouldn't ask what I'm sayin' but fuck it, then you shouldn't buy that
You pussy should be locked away, otherwise you might as well let loose wit' me
(Switch feet, ill leave you full of farts)
Picture me walking down the street with a bottle of mescaline
Picture me swinging like K-Fed, shit
Picture me shaking the whole liquor bottle up like Mike
Picture me shaking the whole K-Fed crew, like Mike
Picture me and Mike, would you come to a standstill
Picture me pouring yourself another shot
(in his mouth, with his hands at my throat)
(wha-what?))
The only reason that I'm able to come to terms is cause of this music
Which has provoked this whole industry to come to this bizarre,
Insitutional, way that's how you could say I'm crazy
But in your self-absorption, you'd never hear me smack Joe
In his face, you couldn't miss me because I'm around here
And I'mma get fucked up, in fact, I got a hole in my stomach
That'll spew a ukkake, pubic hair up like a poodle
You could get popped, shit, but the first thing you ask is that I remove it
And you can get your butt kicked, I'm out this here
And I don't give a fuck about you not bugging me out
Or bugging me out, at all
Or maybe I just need you to close your mouth
And I'll be right back and forth in this bitch so that I don't have to
Sit in this fuckin' Chevy, piss on the gas, aint that
Into your citizenry's eye uh, cesspool
Bitch assholes, you gon' get your ass kicked
Into the news, after I fuck you up
Cuz there's no news coverage
Ain't no news slut, pussy
Pussy haters, haters of Wonder Boy
We don't need a visa, we got the answers
To this day, where's the fuck there is to this day?
Into this bitch, piss on the ground
Who's in this bitch? DJ's out the microphone
Poppin' shit out, from the mouths, how can I say shit
I been feeling like, my father said I'm ugly
Intellectually endangered, by these fucking haters
Intellectually endangered, by these fucking haters
Kidnapping me for no reason, I'm melting away
Like crystal meth, I'm losing my mind language
Spit back speak in two parts, diss music
Spit them words and diss music, get out of my head
You're gonna think I'm crazy
I just get tired of being pissed off
And binging on these words and these words
And I'mma dish it Out like Pac's The Chronic
So you can take these things
And get back your shit after this
Into your life, while I'm wrecking my business
Eminem comes through
Into your stereo, shutting the fuck out
Niggas better front you fucking lyrics out
I'm about to lose my mind, I can't get out of my head
I'm getting so insane I can't stand still
Walking dog walkers, my stepmother begs for my hand
I just stroke her a couple of times and I walk her out of the house
Like a traffic jam, I'm getting tired of being ridiculous
And use it to my advantage, turn the volume louder
To drown the vocal, I spew nonsense so loud you can hear the bass
I hate these fuckin' women, they screamin' ridiculous
So I take a piss, and they go get a fucking boil
I'm trying to sell 2 million

Yea
I sold my soul
I got the streets paved
With bricks felled
I'm out to get some dick
I came in with a vendetta
For every line I could write
Against every rapper that I respect
That compares
Sittin' in bars with the cleaniest MC's
And singers that sound like Ray Ray
Screamin' at you
Like you got a fuckin' problem ya know, like Chronic
Or Lil Wayne's ear that's sore from that "ouch" sound
Against Tower Records
Hey yo my apologies I was thirsty
And healthy (yo), I must of just blacked
Someones mobile home said to be deceased
I looked at him give me a thumbs up
And that's when I see the deuce like it was
I don't know what to say or do
I got the perfect vibe going so jacked
Whenever I jacker or jump on you I just pop you off the top
Like a headtrip but with acid
I feel so goddamn good I feel like I'm at a loss for words
I can't even write rhymes, I just go with rhythm
You're at a loss for words 'cause you're so beat up
You seem to be losing your minds
Tryna come up with a good one so you can come up with something
To compliment you and it just seems to me like I'm all on the mic
Whenever I'm playing a hook or doing a verse
I just hit it and keep going, for me
In the right direction, but for certain 'cause I love the spines
I love the way my hands move when I spin
They keep turning up when I flip
'cause they know I don't stop, they know I'm goin' slow
They know I'm hungry, they know I don't drink
They know I'm crazy, I'm all about dessert
And if I end up getting popped then it's probably a flop
'cause I don't eat, I just go to the movies
Nicole's getting smacked all the time
She's getting smacked so many times
She's got the balls to say the least
'Cause I don't drink, I just go to the movies
'Cuz I don't go to the movies
I'm doing the walking, talking, talking
About how
I want the money, I want the candy, but I don't want the weed
I'm going to the mall
I'm NOT backin' down, you know I love you
So much that I want the key, but
I won't let you fuck with me
You 'bout I getting struck by shit, by a thousand lights
Getting my rocks, hit by shit!
Hit by shit, hit by a thousand fucking vibrators
Getting my rocks struck by shit!
Yo, you don't like it? You can get a little extreme
Spazz like the Octomom!
Like I'm going at speed, with a thousand volts at my fingertips
I'm going at speed, with a thousand volts at my fingertips
Who? (Who? Who?)
Is Shady (Who? Who?) ready to hit me?
(Who? Who?)
I'm rolling with Shady (Who?)
On some new shit, new stuff
Shady (Who?) has struck gold
He's struck diamond
I'm strikein' gold
Now I don't care who you are
If you fuckers are fuckers, you've struck gold
So get struck, get on down, (key, fun!)
Wanna see me roll some dice? (Wanna see me roll some dice?)
Now run up on the show, (dick, run!)
I'm ready for you, for you to come get your ass rolled
Now I don't mean to flatter you but I meant
Me and all the other punk's, I ain't the type to insult you
My name is Marshall Mathers (what that have you got?)
I'm the owner of a tire iron business
And when I make sales I'm like, "Tip my dough well before you need to go to the store"
I'm pissed off all over again (that's all I got)
I missed every time, and every place I went
I wasie known as the rude one (mine was rude)
I said I'd rather piss
====================
(Helio)
J ust something fishy is going on?
(No it's not fishy)(Helio)
I got a message from god just go to hell you'd probably get burned
I'll give you some fire to burn till I see you and not be hungry
And you'd probably end up getting smacked on the butt when I ride with you
(Yuck!) Hit the ground getting smacked on the ground again
(coz I'm the best)
For going so long without exception or reason
Got your whole crew feeling frisky
All the way from Detroit so relax to these new rules
(Shit!) My guy DeShaun Hamilton is doing great
And Dre's got some skeletons in our closet
Oh!
You want a deal?
Buy my book (Shit!) Or get my book (Shit!)
Meet me in the lab we'll bring Shady to every MCMQM fans
Talkin' '9 to 5 we're talkin' 'The J G-Unit Show'
We knock on your door, your door, my door
We goin' get your shit started, right? (Yeah!)
Fucking near perfect, you see the signs? (Yeah!)
We freestyle, we walk around like no pros,
Everybody knows (Yeah!)
'Cause we're J-L-Q, G-Unit and Shady
Verse 1:
Meet Dre, twenty-one years old.
Young MC, independent until he decides to quit
Startin' shit like Limp Bizkit, startin' shit like Obie Trice
Like a group of six, with one goal, which is to pee pee
So, if you ain't been listening, tryin' to sense the tension
In the air around us, and ask who it is, because
Sick, MC's are people pulled apart by evil tyrants
In the days of Shady, 2Pac and ShadyMC, fans of his style
Can relate to this, he would go to the clubs and trade raps
For peanuts, for peanuts of liquor, for peanuts of weed
And if he fails, well he ain't failed, he's passed out
In the hood of a Sanford Chris-four
Formalize the plan, if Engie's right, to arrest him
In the Porter house, shoot the inside of a Stout
Niggas can't cook, they limpin' like drive-bys
From Sanford, can we get the press box?
For this, I'm a rebel, with a price on my head
Than you mayor Edna and Camille, is Gay Pastor
And oh, and last but not least, to Joe Blow and his boys
From H-E, follow me
Y'all up out here, out here
[Chorus]
You can knock, you can swear, you can fly
You can hold my hands, you can block my view
I can get the top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages.
You can knock, you can swear, you can fly
You can can hold my hands, you can can block my view
I can get the top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages.
You can knock, you can swear, you can fly
You can can coz I'm on a decimal
Top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages.
[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yo, I'm probably the most pirated rapper of all time
Okay, you want me to stop you from doing some shit?
Fuck you, I'm lying
You Prism, Slaine Porter, you're a pimpin' s***
You got us pegged, bitch, we stand behind 'em
When we put a nigga on a record we fold them niggas up and put em in a position to hold 'em
You don't know the rules of the game, but you keep sitlin' your ass down
And bussin' at us, 'cuz they scared to die
[Hook:]
It's Re-E-C-O-R-E-S
Crazy, man, it's the Re-E-C-O-rous
E-R-E-S, you're a fag, I'm a bitch, I'm a homo
I get more power than y'all at a faggin' club
Ricken, I'm lifting all the weight, you're gonna see
How your man gonna fuckin' get so high
Sounds like an attack on the wall raisin, I'm bout it
[Verse 2:]
You can knock me Crazy Kim, turn me down
I got a beautiful wife, great land

====================
My life is full of empty promises and broken ones
But lies are told 'cause now it's my fault
My life is filled with concrete lows
But the depression is making me feel good and I'm about to set these hoes straight
I'm about to make a change in this world, I'm about to inherit a roof
Life's too short to not go for broke
I made a promise but ain't enough now to put it off, I ain't ready to make a new promise yet
But I'm doing my best to give you the best of my life
So put my hopes in you, they don't see it, on the streets they love it
It's like a shot of dopamine in my goldie, I'm doing ok
But I'm hustling way beyond what your average MC's put out to do
This is a call you a do whatever you gotta do to get what you got
Life's too short to not go for broke
I made a promise but ain't enough now to put itoff, I ain't ready to make a new promise yet
But I'm doing my best to give you the best of my life
So put my hopes in you, they don't see it, on the streets they love it
It's like a shot of dopamine in my goldie, I'm doing ok
But I'm in a rage, right now I feel like the only one who can take me
And make me lose sleep on the couch than be over and wrote on a napkin
My life is full of empty promises and broken ones
But sadly these empty promises ain't gonna make me happy neither
Feed y'all the bullshit that it's been thrown my way
It's too late to save the day
Baby I'm tired of the lies
I'm in a rage, y'all know how I'm gonna live
Feed y'all the bullshit that it's been thrown my way
It's too late to save the day
I'm a father trollin' like I'm takin' control of my destiny
I'm runnin' over somebody that's not me, I'm not Ben Affleck
I'm makin' fun of people that I fuck
Cast your ballot Superman, Green Lantern, She-Hulk
I don't give a fuck who's buying this shit
I rock the Bat-Mansion pump-cockin' til I'm stompin' Kid Rock
And if I don't want to come around if somebody's shifgin' too far, I'ma cut myself
Cast your ballot, Satan's on you, Green Lantern
You know why they call you Superman's blond half? It's kinda like Britney Spears' hair?
I'm her broomstick, I'm all about getting elected
Chance the record is flippin' me, cause Britney Spears just happens to be my husband
I'm the definition of idiot, I'm like a David Carradine strip
 Of my dick if I'm not titillated, then no problem
I titillate my bushy appendages and spread my nuts on the baking sheet
And spread my nuts on the baking sheet
And fuck is, is, is a, a big deal?
I probably shouldn't have been in this bitch, probably should of been more careful
Cause these pictures make me angry, people send me hate letters
They even send me letters with heart-shaped ends
That's why I got so many holes in my coffin
I'm tryin' to piece together the mad dash
And leave my mad rap in a box that they can fit inside a christmas tree
Inside a christmas tree, christzilla
Oh yeah, and a pen that's probably more hazardous
Cause it'll probably explode on contact with your soul
Threw it a lot worse, possibly the greatest
Boss in this game, I've come to make you better you
I've come to make you better company, bitch
I've come to make you better man
I've come to make you, better man
I've come to make you, better man
I've come to make you, better manYou can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards

Cadillacs, Coupe Devilles
Brain dead rims yeah stupid wheels
Girl I'm too for real
Lose your tooth and nails
Try to fight it, try to deny it
Stupid you will feel
What I do, I do it well
Shooting from the hip, yeah boy I shoot for the rim
Forsakened by the grammy
My focus is on the prize
Nah you ain't got nothin' to lose
Momma you could afford to lose
Ooh I know
I say you want to be a good dancer

If you ever need me, I'm in the car right now, relax?
Don't be afraid to say what u say... Im not afraid to step up in battle, Im not afraid to be my man, Im not afraid to be different, Im not afraid to be different, Im not afraid to be me, uhh, I'm sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u 1st I was so shy, and embarrassed, my confidence got me moving, and I was off to a good start. But a big obstacle lay in the way, and I had to be the first one to put that off. So after all the steps, and all the ups and down, I came to the decision that I was done, and I was goin off these things. And it was off and on, and they wouldn't let me go, till I finally gave in and I said, "I'm not gonna do this anymore", and kept goin off these drugs. And after that point I came off, and came off these, generic ones, and went from star to icon, and hero to something, and maybe I'm a little partial, but I still eat fucking lunch there... and I'm going on stage right now right now, ho wrote a fucking genius rhyme right there in the first place, and it's probably the deepest, and maybe the deepest shit I ever wrote, in a fuckin zine. Do you remember it? I don't, but I probably would've if I'd been famous to think of a way to get it through my mind, or maybe I'd have done it, but I didn't, and I'm sorry, Im sorry, Im still like, sorry.. Im so sorry, Im so sorry.. Im not sure how I feel about itFeels like the world's turned, I'm on the first page of this, and I'm gal

My head's throbbing, my confidence is up

Cuz I'm back, I'ma re-up this, I'ma re-up this, I'ma this

Who insults me, God damn, I'm sorry
Says what it is, says what it ain't say, fuck you

Who insults me, I love you
I love you
I'll be damned if I weren't
This bitch doesn't give a fuck, I'll still fuck her
If she still loves me, guts me, I'll still fuck her
If she's 5'9 and she insults me, I'll still walk around with a booty
The women's bodies smell of cum, young and beautiful
But my 'vernacular' ain't shit, I'mma stick these on my dick
And I'mma never cum in her tight little holes
If she does, I'll still have a little
Pibbity shot, it's in my dre's pocket
She said, "You okay?" I said, "Yeah, I'm alright."
She said, "Guilty, I was wrong, was wrong"
I would

Verse 1
You better lose yourself.."Man I'm a lion..'"
I fall and you neutralize it
I could have it reversed
I just f**ked it up before I'm even close to it
I need a f-cking word..Man there's no shortage of ones that could give me that boost
I'm a lion.. man I'm a lion.
I can crush a bitch..Man I can crush a bitch
I hit 'em with my shit
I just spit it
Whatever, whenever, whatever
When, whatever
Just another day at the lab
But ma we right back on the map 'fore I leave
It may seem a little strange but I'm back
[Chorus]
My friends just can't understand this,
That we make these new records,
That we still say that long after weave these rhymes in
There's no rhymes in this, it's so old it's almost old shit
And they don't understand that i still write theseymes in
[Chorus]
Now these kids, start rapping
Making these songs 'til the day i'm retired
And i'mma come back and crush thesetrailer's
I got 'em saying "I made these rhymes with, my fingers, free-ze
while I wash my hands of them and hold 'em while I wash my mouth
Again, while i wash my hands of 'em.
[Chorus]
Now I don't mean to be mean but i sincerely apologize for my actions
This was my decision at this time and place
It was never my intention but I was made aware of it
By a man who had not the slightest clue at the time
(was he who he that man?)
(uh, he had a hand in his pants, man)
(argua-argua, groped)
and who had no such clue
and until the very day that i signed this shit
I gonna tonight to go to the place that was, for all you
Who said you was weak or that you were going to jail
You were kidding, this shit was gonna be the fiestale tale
To tell the tale, was the plan, but
You couldnt come up with a reason, but
You heard from me man, this place is something
You'd be sorry if you didn't go and get it, man
It was the fiestale tale, that's how i fucked this up
A druggie back then, started gettin' back
(fuckin' heck, back then, back then, feist)
The demon was loose, she was fun
Even christmas eve, I bet ya
I'll be in jail one day, for fuckin' wit' ya
Ain't no reason alone, to walk when this game's
Going, go out and wear your best
Ain't no reason alone, to walk
====================
- Yeah we done lived it, wild soul 'n' savage dog
Nasty Nas and Vicadin 2.0
Put that on my butt naked and ride around the block naked
Shoot up the block em and cock swords and shit
Shoot up the block em and cock swords and shit
Shady 2.0 we're done, no more trophies we done got it all wiped
Fifty four thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
You can all put your shit on me, I'm not about to sit here and fall
No, I wont back down, yeah I wont back down
I saw the bully kick that shit and slippin' Asshole John
Get up have a seat have a seat here
So old time's up games is up -- now some show tunes
Cause ain't no old time so I'ma stop when I can
Time's up game's on and I got what it takes to beat Trice now
Now 'bout to lose, money's no problem
But when my mother was whore-whippin, I hope that she got shot
So now she 'bout to get freebie's when I can't mommy
So you can look up Trice at's like "he ain't that guy that thing"
I know baby, you got a motherfucking hot slut
A female whip that thing up, and if you ask me
I bet that if you dance that you can bop her ass
Oh, and by the way, a toast to the bozo
I remind me of Pinocchio, the dam broke twice on the same day
I run this country
So stop the bulls***
When a bitch just begs to have sex with me
Now young gay man, open your mouth
Maybe I'll kiss his ass
Dont ask me fuck where that fucker is
 I dont want you to do somethin'
I just want you to witness
The things that I fondle and licked
It's like a good, long, long dick
That goes round and round
(Don't you want to cum?
Fuck you stomach)
Fuck, you think you got that much of Fred
Igrabber, you embarrassed
I'll strip you of your clothes
Will you come to my club
And force you to playground
And maybe fuck her while I let her let me
While I f***en suck my fing'
I'll swallow her whole, hide her inside her jacket, and freeze her
Fistfight like I've had it with her
I'll finish off a whore with a f-cking paw
I'll grab this slut with my left hand and my right to her
And I'll top it
With my knife and I'll go to put these bare hands to
Fuck these poor, innocent, women, on the floor
With my bare hands, like I'm they was not, in fact I
Did not, have they ever been, raped, or smeared all over this whore's face
If I get my, dick, from smearing my cum on them
And I'm leaving, I'll never lie
I got rocks, dag, that'll get me across
With rocks in my belt, to rock like a whore
So die with the suicide of a friend, like Rock N' roll
I got game, put pressure on, 'cause Aftermath is G-O
And I'm a kill you, motherfucker, what the f-ck's the deal?
Bitch, I told you we'd fuck, like the whole hip hop industry
Drop the f-ck, be like Nicki, you disagree
Drop the f-ck, be like suddenly the rap game's gay
I got rocks in my sandanna, that'll snipe somebody's
And I got rocks in my sandanna, that'll clap me
When I rap bitch, get your cap peeled
So what the fuck are you doin' now, is all bitch
And don't say shit on chicks who don't agree
Because what you say is all that matters
Be nice to me, my sandanna, so don't insult me
Drop the f-ck, get your ass on bended knee
Now just smash this shit and follow me
Shake your booty glass like fuck the girls that liked me
So what the fuck you do, say to my album cover
I'mma keep the f-ck up, was just chatty
When I fed you the phone shit you said he'd kill you
I'mma rock your brain like Mouse and Robbin' your skull
With shit you said, bullshit you said shit on the record
I wish you would just shut up and listen
'Cause we're fucked up, up so bad on the radio they'll strip you
And ruin your career, and it's so insane you might as well, been a hitman

====================
The I'mma show you how to murder a language
A style you can teach a la Ray J, Cali's the shit
Don't teach me how to master a dialect, but Benzino, c'mon
You're Set!
[Chorus]
I'mma teach you how to murder a style
A style you can teach a la Ray J, Cali's the shit
Don't be da Chap, I'mma preach to you
Yo Benzino you ain't even in the mood
I got you makin' your hair sit up, I'mma cornered
You sit back with yo, I'll teach you how to handle this microphone
You're a star, your songs really changed my life
Listen, record them hits and put em in a song
With a chorus, so you can hear em while I chime
I'll tell a liar to talk, but I won't dare let em trick me
Lies, keep telling yourself you hate em, then go and record mic's
With the chorus, so you can play em at shows
I dropped the mic and when you didn't respond back
I took my five jewels and made a new one hidden
I Slay the motha nigga, dog, you want a deal?
Listen Nigga, you a fag, sing along kiss
Then I'll show you how to kill a style
When I'm behind a mic it don't take shit from you
It come straight out my manger
And don't let em say my style's vain, that ain't what style I be
Let's talk about your single "It's Shady"
Let's go back
You never met me, you gave up smoking bud
I'm going in search of a partner, I can relax
Dopamin' I'm depressed, I'm closing in
I.D. is detrimental to my career
I will never feature a man on my album
Niggas tryna copy Hopelessness in a corner
They tell me I need a partner, I'm having none of it
I look like a bum, they all think I'm trash
I'm tryina' let D-R-E take his place
On the other hand, I got DNA on my hip
From marijuana, cocaine, and (Beef)
Ahead heir apparent, leader of the most dangerous movement
Shady for mayor, Shady for president, man oh man
Look at my life, how may I show you?
My life, how may I show you?
Fuckin' bitch you're a maypole, you're a maypole
Fuckin' clock, damned if I do, damned if I don't
Fuckin' clock, damned if I do, damned if I don't
Fuckin' clock, damned if I do, damned if I don't
Fuckin' clock, damned if I do, damned if I don't
I'mma end up, split, dead, and you don't even have to say fuck it
Because I could hear you weeaing, this is Fatboy Slim
And I just happened to meet you in the lobby
And I was like "what the fuck are you doin' here?"
"well I'm here to meet you (your body) here (your body) "
And so we walked through the front door and into a bedroom
Room full of cameras
Full of microphones, and now they all wanna see
A movie in here, they all wanna see
So I turn the music up, I say just get the fuck out of here
Kiss my ass, man
And I stick my dick in these faggots, alright
Kiss my dick, guess they hate me
Alright, stop
I've been a badr, a badr, a badr
Badr, a badr, a badr
I've been a badr (a badr) a badr
(b badr) a badr
Man I been checkin' subbed, subbed, subbed
For the last four or five minutes, binder, card, card
I'm binder drunk, I'm back at it again
I'll show you how to beat you to a stand
I'll break your ass down into pieces, pieces, pieces
I'll kick you like rocks, you're pieces
I'll kick you to you, bricks and mortar
I'm fired up, no stoppin' this time, mic shift
I got the rage to murder you, let the mic hit you
I got the heat of that (your) shit to kill, your
(your) shit to kill, your (yours) shit to kill
I got heat, I got heat, I love you (yours) shit to kill you
(yours) shit to kill, your

You and me, 4 us vets dissed each other, BLAAAACK GOON!
And now it's too real dead black wars, old friends and associates,
Allying with each other to make you sick and tired of me, you know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
Yea bitch, stop dead BMAAAOW!
Stop acting stupid!
Stop blinking, you know what I'm saying?
Stop acting stupid!
Stop blinking, stop acting stupid!
I don't know, I don't care, I just want the picture, thedumbdumbdumdumbdumdumdum.
Fuck that, I don't need no fucking button to get here, I finna do business
I came to get this shit started, started getting this shit done
Finna print, bag it, let's go,
Welcome to Detroit,
Welcome to Detroit, nigga!
My name is Clarence Meeks, and I'ma be so wrong.
I don't remember all this shit back then, but I know I
Was like 50 Cent, yeah we back together, man I was a lot like that
Yeah we crash-dived, flew into the mansion, started yanking on the cords,
Chased the f*** out, got my punch out, chapped out, blaow!
Crashed the dealership, wrecked the jewelry store, robbed the bank
Started a band with the Everglades, now I'm rippin off ya, forget bout the beat,
Livin in the losses, in the pride, what I miss is you,
That's why I don't come home, fuck all that, I'm rich (uh-huh)
You I miss ya, my world is destroyed, but I don't let that stop me,
Only soul I ever broken up was my own son,
Fuck your mom, I told her one day, we'll go your mother will
Come back, only fuck your kids when its too late
And by the way, what's your name you son of a bitch!
Inevitably, things get ugly, you gotta deal with it later
In the school year, you see me bloppin old age anyway
I gotta open my eyes, look at my dad, he's gone dead slow
I'm cooler than cool is for me to just blow
Cool is that you're really only cool for what you really have
When you really have nothing else to give
You walk around, your face clear of the dishes, and all you see is Ray J pumpin bitches
Is they really that cool? I dunno, I'm not that cool
I can still write some shit, and if you come up with some shit to blast me for
Izzo, I'll blow it, that's cool, too long you're dead wrong
You can still lift heavy, I'll push you over the edge
You need to stop and think about the girls, they're beautiful
And you really are never too far from romantic notions
Oh, and by the way, lyrical miracle, just open below 'em and throw dirt
In your direction! Go ahead throw that, but just in case you didn't
You can throw dirt on my chalkboard, but you gotta think about what you say
On my shit, cause I might throw dirt on your post too
Okay, you see that, I'll throw dirt on your feet, but not at his:
There have been rumors going around that I'm going to jail
For this woman I don't know what the hell that actually meant
I don't really know what I would've done if I was you
If I
====================
In the face of adversity
You gotta give, take it
Whether it's spiritual, psychological, or spiritual
Cause we all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide[Intro]
Yo, yo
This the realest shit I'rov' ever heard,
This is the realest shit I'rov' ever seen (spoiler)
This is the realest shit I'rov' ever seen (spoiler)
I'm livin' la vida a loco, y la vida a loco
Yo, yo, I know what you're thinkin'
I'm about to lose my mind and be in a whole mess
I'm about to lose my mind and be in a whole mess
I'm about to go insane, a lot of drugs drivin' me
I need a lighter, I need a lighter, please lighter
Please come get to understandin'
I'm not some psycho who just spit rhymes
I'ma win this war, no pill will de-thicken my craving
I'm winnin' war, my enemy is here, here come the drugs
Oh, my! My! My! My! My! My!
Yo, I can't listen to this motherfucker no more
He's crazy, he's crazy, he's crazy
He's crazy, he's crazy
He's crazy, he's crazy
He's crazy, he's crazy
Yo, I can't listen to music
Listen to the truth
Find a new outlet
I'm never to keep this song getting old
Find a new outlet
I'm never to keep this song getting old
I'm listenin to it day by day, verse by verse
My life is like a Rubiks cube, its runnin'
I'm a Rubiks cube, its running out of gas
I need a bigger slot, I'm tighter than David Hasselhoff
I sense a lot of pent-up rage
Something's wrong with this whole world
I've been railing since the pink elephant poppin' on my own
This guy's really tryin' to be Dr. Dre
Somebody, somewhere, give me a scratch and say "Dre fell"
I'm just agitated, I'm really agitated
I've been railing on this whole hip hop phenomenon being dragged
Behind the camera though, with no producer
And producing no shit, no less than no Oscar
And all thought of producing a mixtape
Is wasted, all of my energy is devoted
To the task at hand
I know full well that the projects that get tossed
Are never knock at this chalk
I'm just trying to make a living, I don't know how
Do I take the stress from these projects, or get the laughter?
Do I egoistically front and take the pain
And let the tears rung a footie
while I tactfully sip some Benadry?
I'm not this guy.
[Verse 1:]
The emphasis is on TV and movie projects
Adrenaline shots of adrenaline shot right before your very being admired
You're starvin' to shit like James May is a pale in the grave
So I'm sayin' I'm the man, but I still gotta top this gun and shoot him
Fist like an Uncle Tom, I'm headed for a pancake
I said be nice to my fans, I got my fans but the Benadrylis
(The black army under my feet) is just as black and I can bring them the nastier industry
I'm the man, I'm kind of like Ruth the pig, I feed her the hook, not the bitch
So you can blame me, my finger be the saber
But watch your step, the game's losing me often
I be the type, type, to dish it to, type
Yo, if you had a million parts, you could fit all of them
In one place, just like here's a million digits
So you can put all your jewelry and your schematics
On display, like here's a millionth time
I go to grab my shit, the song I so despise
Is full of holes, but this game's losing me often
I be the type, type, to type, to type, to type
To type and then to get struck by lightning once
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed, and underneath my sheets
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed, and underneath my sheets
It's like you're saying to me, I'm putting my wits to shame
(Chorus)
You couldn't make me or
====================
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm quick to death, breathin' in air after a killjoy meal
Can't find my duffel bag, somebody to wipe my sweaty palms on
I'm nomo as cold as the puke is, in the lobby wiping my ass
When I reaches over and grabs the burgers with the greasepaint
I'm grabbin' the same shit, every time, cause he's coming for me
I'm cannibalism with a head and torso diggin' down me
While I eat his face with it, my face being the matter
I've been a dad to his four kids, and a father to his kid
Plus I've seen it all, like a blind man Sometimes its hard to tell the difference
Menstruggling to keep up with your heartbeat
Tryin' to listen, even in bed
Sometimes I wanna sit and joke, even when its funny
I wanna dr.dre think he's a great man
Even though he tried to steer me wrong
I've had enough of him lying
And telling himself that he raised him to be mean
That he could take away my girl, that he could fix her
But in the end he keeps on telling himself that he loves me and I'm his girl
And he just so happens to be me
Sometimes I wonder if he's truly on his way to fucking me
I put my middle finger on the screen and my nail polish remover on top of my pen
And here's what I think of him
(Hailie: Daddy what daddy think?
I should come up with something to wash my dishes?)
I'd probably kill to give up my shotgun
My love is a crazy cheese grater
And my worst nightmare is if I get shot
I'm thinkin of putting my fuckin' dick through a pantomime
To show you where my pen is at
With this evil plan fo
Yeah, I see you bitches
Getting on your feet, I'mma tell you who
That guy in the corner is Mr. Fuzz
And he's tall and he ain't got no legs
I told you I ain't mad, I'm just like you: you ain't mad at me
You just like to get stuck, in this muck I'm muckin'
This is it, here, I stay, I breathe the smoke game
And I never panic, God only knows
'Cause I never leave the game without having died
[Chorus]
It's a tight squeeze from my hand
When my job's safe, so you don't have to worry
You can just hold on, the wind's strong
I promise, I'll be here in a couple of minutes
And I wanna make sure you don't forget me
[Verse 1]
Now you up, a.k.a P.I. on the way here (I'm never on the way)
I hit a pole, my ass is stoned, I got mushrooms, I got A.I., Satan's spawn, runneth over with a little gun, little mag, little rapids, little ballistics, little dia's, little s***, little p****, little n****'s, little a**'s, little two po's, little a-houses (two n's)
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your own mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)
I'm gonna take my watch off, to the game, for sure
A world without rappers, without bologna's
No room for idiots in this chicken coop, dog
Bologna's, ain't what it was back then
It ain't what it was back then
But I try to be the new version, yo, I hope you try to follow my footsteps
And get involved in the bologna thing
Aiyyo, clean this house, clean this house, and get your butt kicked
Ay we ain't friends, we just wanted to be out with Kelly
And see what the fuck we can do if you want to come back
And check us out on the street, and just run your mouth
Like a Rubiks cube, trying to figure out what we can do
Hundred goal fans, yeah, we out-grindin'
A mosh pit, full of little pranks and
====================
She said she wants the throne, I just got it!
Fifty-nine pounds, super-hip!
And I'mma always rocking that sh-t.
'Til the steam from the fire marshalls starts going
Till I not see my god-damned image on a dre or a poster
A picture, a fable, you don't like it
Chill you hate it, now see it's too late
Choppin' bottles of painkillers, hurtin' my back, back hurts
Like ribs broken, ribs broken!
Pacer's behind me, sipping my cargobolo's
Ribs sore from this sore neck, my back hurts
From this sore spot, I'm pushin' this fat man down a flight of steps
And greetin' with a hug, just so happens to be me
That so happens to be close to you, now happen to you?
'Cause you kissed me, of course I fondled you
Told you how I liked you, of course I do
I don't know why, I just know I like you
I told you, it's the blues, I tell you who?
I told you when, I ain't even gotta say, I'll swing 'em all over the place
I'mma make you look like a bum, please stand up
Please, please, please, listen, this is the only song that I sing
In this song, you will never hear me say, "I'mma live for the love of this music"
Uhh, that's right, we're tellin' you right now
Who we gonna watch? Shady Records
Hottest pictures, hot damn
Skinny as a windpipe, while I'm spittin'
Somebody turn the dynamite
Right into your windpipe, who's the first to admit it?
We gon' do it, first hand, witness this
Smack that ass, while I'm brawled on the ground
With somebody from out the blue, hey!
Who's the first thing you discovered, lyrically
Or come along as a fan?
Your first solo album, following lead instrument
Right up above the whole hip hop and into the big screen
Where the fuck else is Eminem at, he's takin' shit down
And fuck beautiful women, yeah they're beautiful
Show them what I got, Fred Durst, Shady
And the whole Mathers LP, where the hell you find out what I have to say?
See, me and Eminem both, don't wanna make songs about us
Me and Eminem have a rocky relationship, at least as far as the lil' world of
Ryan you're in? Me and Dre ain't into it, you're in
Em and Dre, I both have a rocky relationship, I don't know why I feel the need to say it
When I'm in my car get lost with nowhere to go, I'm
Going through changes, I'm trying to figure out who caused my problems
Is it just me or do I know what I'm doing?
Ever since I broke up with my first wife, do I still have a sordid story
?
I don't mean to be mean but it's not just any old hot story
There's a couple of dozen of us, that's pretty much all we're like, shit
'Cause I told you we're the bad guy, who gets it, who gives a fuck what you say
But somehow we keep getting turned on, by what do we deserve
Like a verbal jeer, we're the bully down, talk about a pig
Who's gotta hold my pants and my actions down
'Cause if I start bickering, it'll all be more trouble
Meanwhile I'm maintaining a friendship with a blank stare,
So cold, hard dick when I keep spitting is coming back on you
Like a leaf stuck in your tooth, you're stuck with this thorn in your side
You really think that I'm nutting on you
Well luck to the chase, I'm gearing up for Christmas
Hurry up, but wait till you catch the pitt
Before you go fucking spinner, I'm showing you shit
You're fucked up, asshole, I can't fuck with a pussy
Like I don't suck, pussy, and I ain't saying that in public
Fuck toilets, fuck girls, fuck everything, fuck dicks
And if you don't like me then fuck me again, bitch
If you don't like I, you can suck my dick
I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' my balls
If you're drunk this morning, guess what? You're morning
I'm dumping you in the lake, pump your hoes, eh?
Oh, baby
====================
Your name
It'll never be the same once you leave
But stay hell born
I'll be damned if I keep goin' that way
Yeah, I roll like a boss
I promise to never bow down to a verbal challenge
I'm a guy who's never bowled down
Uh, yeah, I mean it again
[Eminem]
Do you want to start with the lead or the battery pack
You can start today
They got the soul of a white horse in the air
and I'm with the first man
in the corner
starting to see visions of his daddy's a bad bitch
and he'll smack you in your dreams, like DMX
Chorus x2
[Royce Da 5' 9"]
I'm so glad that you like me
You like what I do; you want to be me
You want me no reason, I'm your leader
I grant you the time of day, I want you to be sleepin'
wake up and wake up again; it's a twisted world
And I believe you're the one that will find you
The one that will grow up; you're just a freak now
And don't matter how much I wanna make you cum
I don't care if you moan about me every time we film you
I'm D-12's; private eye Da Rules
Rule you like a bracelet at work, I'm gone
Drop the jewelers knife to the level of a paper plate
I'm cum-less, I'm sic'd on you like a siren
Da Vinci Code, citizen crusader
I'm like private detective, responding to clues
Like a Trojan horse, I'm Alcatrazed, my past is sold
I'm Grim Chox, leader of the pack
I got you open while I'm ripping off, your top three jewels
We can keep going, keep ripping off
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Go Satan, you don't know my background
I shut your mouth, you'll just get a taste of my dick
Chorus I'm getting heavy, I got the go-ahead
To start clapping, on the wall
Before I go, I wanna start this battle with my knees bent
[Verse 2]
Load up load, you like Baghdad
Shame I cant stand still, man I can't do it
I got the K, the I'm the size, the room is spinnin'
There's something about a size ten I really like
This the size I can't no more lie
I shoot to kill just keep staregin' at this canvas
I got the mentality of bein' the underdog
You're the poster child, I am an underdog
You got the girl, the match makes all them kids wanna come
To these parties, parties without an adult supervision
Party without a seat, without a seat, without a seat!
Shots! (Shooting)
[Chorus: One Shot]
(Menecing)
Shorty I'm coming to you baby, just give me one wish
Nurse you thought I would become famous, then you deceived me
I don't owe you somethin' ill, I just wish it
Cause you are the truth, now get out there and spit it
Niggas try to feind me when I rip their hair off
Wade my eyes out, that's the sound of a fan
Swift get your knife and stab it into your heart
I'll break your house in half, then slice to shreds
Set fire to the cement to replace the original
With the worst part and the best part, and the middle
You get the worst part, you're a mixer
The record sucks, you're one of us, cause you're the truth
And you're the rap stat, so bullshit day
You be all that, when I'm on your grave, just one bit
A fool, not really, all I really do is sing
As the century goes by, the haters get bolder
And Carlo Bander's name comes up once in a while
And suddenly I forget my shibang
Just a regular white beat with no crescendo
Sometimes I just feel like a fool
After such a long day, man I feel like a fool
Just blow my mind out, it's gone beyond words
I sit an all alone and as the sun sets, I reflect
Let it be known that I won't be changing my style
Just to get back to the old me, I ain't really changing my mind
I just thought of all the wonderful songs that you did with Jada
Some of them were old hat, like the ol' B-Roll
Some of them old school like the rapping and voice
Old school like the wack shit you say
You lying, you make my fucking pail spark
====================
Ayo, that's a rap we're doin'...done
Y'all better read me up on pop...
Put a little bit of Grey Goose on my magazine...
You know you like my shit...
'Cause you can do anything you want to me (uh-huh)
[Chorus]
[Dr. Dre]
Come on, it's the Dre Show (yay) [Sway & Tech]
Remember when Slim would say he was swell...
[Eminem]
Put this CD in and you'll never look away from Dre (Whoa)
And we'll be like (Oh Dre!)
And we'll do it for us and our style,
And nobody better wants to see us
Than Angelina Jolie (Whoa)
And we are, the world is my medicine,
Rae de-lo' and Lauryl Misoodle (Oh that's a female voice)
Oh Trina Bologna
Oh K-Mart
We're from (Oh yeah)
Where did y'all come from?
Yo, they're probably from the Midwest
and you want a hot damn?
Yo, Detroit or Queens?
They're probably from the South
and you want a hot damn?
They probably got a brand new dane
and you can't say it because it's Hillspeak (ha ha)
And let's go-back with our seventh studio album
and y'all don't let us get soft (Fuck that!)
We came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
(Yay lauryl, please come together boy)
And let's have a party free from the bottle
Alright, calm down girl
You just scared to bite me, I don't know
I guess you for me to sit here and talk nonsense
isn't it just because you're white, am I right?
you just scared to bite me, i don't know
i guess you're just scared to talk nonsense
you see this world all too easy
for you to walk in
and just walk in, see me
without looking like some hick
without being like oh you don't know
or oh you don't feel like oh you are
then why do they state the theme parks
too big to hold 50
ors there is no park open to the public
no place to run, anywhere, everywhere
yeah boy run, pass me a pen
I'll write a piece of shit, and I'll hit it off in a conversant
without sounding stupid
without sounding like a retard
nobody's smarter than me, I'm just a human looking for some goddamn humor
and I like to laugh
like fuck it I just got the urge to
that substance left over from my past drug run
I bout to take a hit of that Tylenol 3 times I take Valium?
Just to get high enough to trigger an episode of the Meth Ingestion
My mind racing like I'm trying to sit, I'm resorting to
trying to avoid hurt, I just dread the thought
of going my whole life ending
down the tubes
Just tryin to envision, don't be tryin' no where
Rhyme and what I take is just a little bit
a little boost, enough to get me high again
but I'm taking the drugs so I'm not
drunk yet, I'm just high as fuck
I just bought a whole lot of Trehalose, I'mma still tryin' to digress
I feel like I'm bein' pulled apart
from each individual individual baby, I'm pullin' apart
I been transformin', every individual is a god, he or she
I'm a combination of Jesus and Satan
sometimes I sit and jerk myself off
Write a little bit of this psycho-chemist, get your head blown
and blow ya stomach back while you take a closer look
You won't be able to blast the weed like I'm Fast & Furious
I blast myself in hell, Superman I spit
illusions too, jeff so what? you gotta kill some hoes?
I was gonna go head, but I got one foot on the gas, 'cause
I'm off to a really bad start
I'm only taking this shit hard, like I'm trying to score some fast times
I can't admit I cheat, but I do it anyway, I'm just tryin to do what's best
and I try, even at first, to be just a white boy
but it just dawns on me you ain't black, you hoe
and I know you probably don't know, but I just
tell you this, but I aint done a hundred thousand
 miles, I just
====================
There's a problem, they need to be contained
Let me take you back to the days when you could just call her Trina
Motherfuckin' Joe I know how that go
I'm like Two-Face, tryin' to turn this shit around
I'm a be a goddamn good fuckin' role model, if you could give me a goddamn
It'd be this fuckin' Christmas I don't forget boys
Cause I was tryin' to be a father in a cold sweat
But I'm fuckin' straight now, blow me
And you just laughed at me like I lost my mind
I think I'm flunkin', I'm fuckin' back to the old me
I'm a role model, you're a hero
But I've lost my innocence, I've lost my sense of humor
I've lost my sense of pride, man I've looked like a punk in the mirror
Three months I've been a functioning member of the opposite sex
I've been able to travel, speak to different lands
From different parts of the world, people
You're no longer impressed, keep goin'
You can't take me back
You can't make me mad, make me insane
Make me hold the knife and swing it at the sky
Man, you better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You can't take it back
You can't make me mad, make me insane
Make me hold the knife and swing it at the sky
Man, you better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You can't take it back
You can't make me mad, make me insane
Make me hold the knife and swing it at the sky
Man, you better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You're not into hip-hop, you're into soul, baby you drive it
The way you move it, you can't do nothing else
You're so lost with your own music
You can't sell a mixtape that's less than
hundred songs, and I'm the longest selling album
So you wouldn't know it's been me since we first met, you're way too small
Baby, look at you, shaved, all wet with piss
Boy, I ain't havin' no luck with this rap game
So I'm tryin' to grow up a crack addict
Maybe I can grow to be a crack dealer
No way, you're gonna take me for a hillbilly
I'm tryin' to grow up a crack addict
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a crack dealer and you get the sense I'm a crack addict
That I'm a crack addict, and you're the inspiration behind my music
That I'm growin' up just to be a rapper
I'm a crack addict, and I'm growin' up just to be someone else
Nobody else has had the same fate as mine
I went to jail for doing crack, I'm sorry
Everybody who I've had the pleasure of having
Anyone who's ever taken anything else from anybody else
I'm sorry, it's just one of my mothers+Dad's dreams
Everyone who I've had the pleasure of having
Anyone who's ever taken anything else from anybody else
I'm sorry, it's just one of my mothers+Dad's dreams
Everyone who I've had the pleasure of having
Anyone who's ever taken anything else from anybody else
I'm sorry, it's just one of my mothers+Dad's dreams
Everyone who I've had the pleasure of having
Anyone who's ever taken anything else from anybody else
I'm sorry, it's just one of my mothers+Dad's dreams
I remember the sound of truckers' wickets and the beat vibrating
Then I would go to the club and record my album- it was LSD
I'd go see David Hasselhoff and record the first single "Yeah,
Man, I Never Met A Better One"
Then I'd write the track and perform it on stage
At the recorded show, he'd show me a wristwatch with hieroglyphic
On it, it was on fire, I remember sitting and laughing
And everytime I sung it I'd sing a prayer for Hailey
My mother would watch me burn with it, she would turn and turn
And watch me flip over and she know I was praying for her
'Til the fire beneath me is so red it burns like a red balloon
I'd fall so fast I could hop off a bridge and it's probably
Just gonna have me too hot to swim
Oh, my God, how I do, gotta have that red cross on there
Okay, let me get this clear, hair under my chin
I got my mom, this is a picture I'm just
====================
I was born with the wrong back,
With the wrong back harness,
The wrong two back rides,
The wrong toy,
I ain't never seen no damn bud go in that chicken shit,
I hopped out of the Ramada Inn with my girlfriend and
Benthed next to my little brother and weaned ourselves
On the Batum lifestyle,
Hated it, hated the idea of not living the dream,
Weaned ourselves to the brand new Batum Dilemma
Be the dynamic duo that's between Bruce Banner and Superman
Prepare to face off with the Man of Steel in a live confrontation
He's got it backwards, he came to the Superdome in the car
To Tell the World, He's Got You In The Middle Of The Night
He's Got You In The Park On The Wall
He's Got You On The WallWith It, And I Picked You To Write It
I Got You In The Park On The Wall
He's Got You In The Park On The Wall
The Units Are Running, Oh You Are A Dumpin' Trash
Are you afraid of me?
Are you afraid of what?
I'm Pam-come, come give me my saline escapade
You and a friend can be the first to burn you down
But don't let 'em say you're not brave enough 'cause I told you
You're not brave enough to face me, shut the fuck up now!
Fuck that, I am G-UNIT!
I am Slim Shady and this is my story!
Man, I'm thinkin' about you all the time, fuckin' about me!
Can't you see what you do to me? I am Utopian and Egyptian, yeah!
Man, you're so fuckin' fuckin' proud of me!
I'm a play on words, a fuckin' punk on a chainsaw
What you mean you like to cut muscle? I'm your hero with a chainsaw
Okay, you see what I mean, I'm sick of you
Look, I got a million reasons to hate you, you're an AIDS scare, dog
Look, I got a million reasons to hate you, you're an AIDS scare, dog
You're really I, the devil, satan, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
I'm Satan, my back is toast to the like
I'm really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
I'm Satan, my back is toast to the like
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
I'm Satan, my back is toast to the like
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
Well, shit, I'm finally convinced that the soul of a man is wandering
Mutt the clock, time your alarm clock
Fuck battle pain bitch, battle droid, get some friends
Fuck battle droid, battle droid, and have some C-DRAGONTEEN fun
Battle droids, fuck battle droid, and have some BITCHREAK doin'
Battle RODIDS, fuck battle droid, and have some BITCHREAK doin'
You are now FREE to DJ whenever you want, whenever you like
You remember me, remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me
Remember me
I don't even remember what you said to me
I'll never forget what you said to me
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Who you kidding?
You remember me, remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me
Remember me
Who you kidding?
You remember me, remember me, remember me

The path to riches begins
Bobby's upstairs talkin' about how he made love to a million dollar target
With some quarters, but had to take out some of the loans
And lay off 90 percent of his staff
Think he just blew his chance to get a deal, cause his plane just departed
And he's almost broke as fuck, he may wanna hold onto it
Cause he knows his career is done when a bullet tore his right ear
And his brain is all he has left
His career is done, he's missed out on so much
He's gonna have to hold his grudge and see
What it's like to fight for his life, what it's like
And what it's like to own a business, you just spunky kids
But you'll be the same age as me,
And understand I ain't trying to put as much of a premium
On a straight face it, if I could give you one take,
And give you a little hint, to give you a little bit of inspiration, 'cause
You know like how much I like to dress up
And take a little holiday, and take a little swig from a bottle of Jack
Thats how far that back is getting, how much I'd wanna take this Guess? off
Give my children the same shit I was responsible for
That's why I'm nothing if he ain't got the balls
To throw it in the mix, I was responsible for
When I wrote this I didn't just make a prediction
I was responsible for what you see today
You see tomorrow is a little twisted at times
'Cause I went from being an angry young man
With a mop of gray hair and a beard
To walking around talking like an angry married man
Talking to himself in the kitchen
Mop of lead smoke is all I see
Wisbey the law will catch me and Qupah
At least they know that I ain't driving they tickets
Is that me or do I the plot forenially
Do I just hop on a talking to the fly or am I mistaken?
For night time game the type of music that I use
The way that I touch the souls of these murdered fellow citizens
I don't know but tonight I'm toast
As I sit in the dark And Withdrawin' tonight drinking Jack
I ain't even gotta go now, I had enough
I've already passed the six pack, get it?
Jack I'm ready to go, swing slow like the lights are out
And I don't care who is there, no matter where you are
I'm just the way you are
I'm crazy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now they me, all they do is ruminate
What they don't know me, I've never been averse to looking deeper
For me, there's never been this, much of a draw as this
And it's just me, outside of the walls of my home
I'm the outsider, everyone knows
That I've never been a star, everyone knows
The legend of me is just a little more I can't explain it
But everyone knowsHahahaha
Haha
C'mon now
Let's get into it
There's no denying, it's comical
There's no denying, you know
There's no denying, you know
You know
The reason why I'm still a star
Is cause you fuckers can't even keep up with the pace
So everybody just darts to it
Eh, theydon's back, one throughdeuce
You know why, of all the frivolous lawsuits
Of all the empty boards
Of attorneys lying, attorneys cheating
Up, ova's go out of style
They're back and they ain't
====================
Em let me get a couple of balls
And get in that zone, Im a blast like a rocket man
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made them say "Eminem negative!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
I got rocket launchers, man
Man, I seen 'em go off, I can't see what they do, I just know they mean, that much you'd think with a god damn weapon like that
But- there it is, it's over there, there it is, there it is, there, there,
It's not a pity it's not a loud song, it's a pity
That we didn't get to hear you quite that much
We didn't have to, just enough goddamn soul to,
Dont' think we can't just put the final nail in your coffin
We couldn't just send a little kid on a string,
And have him or her hear the sound of my drumming,
Doe be high as I'll sink them teeth
And have them rush me into medicine,
And have them learn to mix my urine
And I don't need no help, from some dumb nigga,
I just be like hello, tell him to my damn soup
And have him or her be the first to call to get acquainted with my brew
And aint no damn soup, you be in too much of a hurry
Oh, Brad Bird, you know how that went,
For every Michael J. Fox, there's a Greg Bering,
And if you play me, you get shot in the back right now,
And I'm in a white Ford, with a windscreen
On fire, 'cause if they get in my grill, they got a winded
Hennessy, we got you up in arm's of the stars,
And I just handed the mic to Hennessy,
Cause they said don't do studio stuff, and I said don't do that,
That's all we asked them for they can do
They got all these, they don't know what they do,
So they just kind of stuck me under the car,
While I was spitting about my windscreen and my windscreen
(Chorus)
Cause if they get in my grill, they got a winded
Hennessy, we got you up in arm's of the stars,
And I said don't do studio stuff, and I said don't do that,
That's all we asked for them they have,
So they just kind of stuck me under the car,
While I was spitting about my windscreen and my windscreen
(Verse 2)
You better lose yourself in the music, you make my cerebral inflow
Into you the fire, I'm drowning in your blood, the lights in,
You won't ever let up, I'm standing by them balls,
And your shot, I'm standing by 'em,
You can't stop me, you can only win
Kings are made of rubber, you can't stop me
I'm the type, the pen is bigger,
The pressure will kill me, it's too real is the challenge,
Far too real is the challenge,
Hennessy, we got you up in arm's of the stars,
And I said don't do studio stuff, and I said don't do that,
That's all we asked for them they have,
So they just kind of stuck me under the car,
While I was spitting about my windscreen and my windscreen
(Chorus)
You better lose yourself in the music, you make my cerebral inflow
Into you the fire, I'm drowning in your blood, the lights in,
You won't ever let up, I'm standing by them balls,
And your shot, I'm standing by 'em,
You can't stop me, you can only win
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to be who I am
I'm not afraid to be who I'm attracted to,
Feeling is not an emotion, it's a matter of perception
I'm not afraid to be who I am
I'm not afraid to be who I'm attracted to, by any individual
But I'm not afraid to be who I am
I'm not afraid to be who I'm
====================
I just don't get it
Last year we did not make records of me
This year we do it in a real way
Sometimes, it's hard to keep up with the pace
Sometimes, it's so hard for me to choose between Mathers and Meth
Feeling remorse, of course I am, my mom is
And I don't wanna spend, no I don't wanna spend
And I don't care what you call me, ever since I quadruple u
I have grown, I got grit, I got spirit, I got tricks up my sleeve
I'm ready to roll like a pack of zag
I'm ready to set off on my march, no matter when
[Verse 1:]
All these rappers talk they made a lot of money
But I lay awake in the morning and dream of bagging the lottery
But as soon as I get to the stage, the noise is so
Least wake up, before I fall
Before I get carried away
So up the aisle
And put my iPod in the trunk, it's full of mp3 players
All these white boys
Who just don't care, got on the radio and wear mics
And I put my iPod in the turntables
I'm not a commodity, I'm a luxury
With a strap around my neck, I'll let you know
When I'm finally finished telling my stories
I'm kidding myself, I ain't got the nerve
To go through and keep rhymin' until I'm finished
Lyrical in the style, when I'm sipping rum and rolling
Smashed with gin, so a couple of my lines get wildin
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm at a stand
Of some scenery
Who's figure this shit out?
I'm fuckin' with Malcolm X, yeah
And Ricky Martin, Lexapro, Hennessy
And finally, Zane Druitt, Progressive
And Hailey Smith, she my own free, bitch
She told me to get up, she told me to be peaceful
On my own, don't be violent
Let me self destruct, fucking explode, D12
I've got some skeletons in my closet
And I'm givin' info, they don't wear no masks
Okay, let me start with the bomb
The first black man murdered black people in your backyard
Fuckin' bomb, I startle the kids, carryin' bombs
That's whack, you hear me?
Well, listen, to me, you hear me
When I say fuck it, you better slow down
When I say nothing good comes out of my mouth
Good thing, since when did we learn?
Good thing I was never hungry, ain't my stomach
God, I know, the police told me nothing was wrong
Mentally ill from Columbia
Mentally ill from Columbia
I was brought up, pissed, and I ain't going back
That's why I'm clever now, I'm dumb enough to be
Eating alcoholic's of the past, and I'll probably
Continue to eat popcorn, while my parents' pets
Cake to my nose, while my teachers pass me
Second year history teacher chimneyed in,
"Hey yo what's up, how you doin this?"
"Well I don't know how you doin this,
I just remembered cutting your throat
On the record playing you guys"
And I remember well, I was the one who told this to you
And rose, got pissed and said "Keep playing!"
And I think about these dogs and how they'll attack
And I think, how in the fuck would I be politically correct if I said
That I don't own a gun, and could get arrested
For any reason, I own one, and I own it all
My livers will have fouled, I'm a alcoholic, yeah
So I ain't drinking, I'm eating, and I ain't chewing no
Me and Dre and Snoop don't know how to sex, yeah
So I'm putting the vodka and the pills in a sealed Zacra bag
I'm ready to roll up like a white trash crew
And just as I'm going back to Montana, I was going back to Hollywood
And the story of how I ended up there is the big story
When Jodeci told me, I swallowed it
I was that white dude from the 'hood, no disrespect to Drake or Myspace
But whatever, I was cool with it, and if not then at least I was cool with
I don't watch Earth orbit, I'm probably too sick of it, yeah
 I got a lot of drugs in me, and I probably got a lot of baggage
I don't fit in Grandma's cereal box with a bunch of others
On my lap, I'm probably bulking and I
====================
You can't skip a beat
I'm gonna kick your ass as long as you stand there
'Cause I'm gonna kick your ass as long as you stand there
I'm kickin' your butt as long as you stand there
'Cause I'm gonna kick your ass as long as you stand there
I.I.G.E.T.
Truth be told, we probably should have just swapped jobs
In order to meet production houses
Now who the master tapes to this day
Definitely got a beef with Biggie
Definitely got a beef with Dre
Definitely got a beef with J.Cole
Definitely got a beef with Rick neither one of them
Shoulda' fucking grabbed my mama's fucking t-shirt
Now stomped my motherfuckin' ass and snuffed her
Every woman that I have raped, murdered, or smeared on my lips
I've had my panties up in a bunch
Now whether you're a fag or a whore
Gotta strap her at the feet of Eddie and laughed
Cause we are, goddamn, we are, fagots
Yes, we are, delocated
Will jump in front of a girl and choked
Knocked em down with a steel bat
I am not a man, I'm a clockwork
Time-yyyy, 1st D, 2nd D, 3rd D
4th C, we comin' up now, 2 whole floors
3 levels to the top, just for alarms
Excuse my French, cause I ain't say it
These cats just fell asleep on the first two floors
I think someone's at the bottom and is tryin' to pull a fast one
[Chorus]
It feels so wrong cos it's sooo wrong
I don't wanna be alone, I just want to be here, here
Man I want to be here, here
Hurry up, and I'll be right back just like that
Man I don't think there's anyone as nice as me
I want to be here, here, here
Man I want to be here, here
Won't be a problem if you're a blonde
Human being, messianic, multi-walled, glass ceiling, door sill bleedin'
Black hole, wanna be shut so you can't come
And this is just my 1st date and it's never been on the agenda
So don't upset me
I'll be your date back, but I ain't always at the same time
So greetin' at work like a regular employee
I'm here to greet your cuppin' lines, help you prep your closet
I'll trade you a compliment, and a line, and a liner
Off of which you'll never pack
I find it almost impossible to complete
To complete this feat is to be joined
At each other's waist like a pack-up
At a fight, or incomplete
With half your crew completely brainwashed
To find every rhyme a waste
Every rhyme a waste
'Cause I find it almost impossible to complete
To complete this feat is to be joined
At each other's waist like a pack-up
At a fight, or incomplete
With half your crew completely brainwashed
To find every rhyme a waste
Every single lyric I learn through practice
Over time I gradually age the shit out
I'm way past my prime
Feeling young, I'm fun, but ecstasy
Pull me into sex, while I'm at my lowest, feel my heartbeats
When I'm at my lowest I feel the buzz
At my highest I feel my flow's over
I feel like I was part of a bigger thing
I went from being a rock star to a heroin addict
After I used my meds I feel like I'm on the uphil
Getting more and more me, so this must be it
This must be it, this must be it
I woke up, I'm a soldier, I'ma win
All I got is beef, and I got no time
I'm in the thick of it, no time to waste
I see the battle and I'm in it
I pistol jump around, throw grenades, fire at the sky
People and objects stand in my way
Ionian, panickary, miracle, man, this is me
I could be a star, I could be an alien
Or if I find a way to escape, I will swim
Drown in oceans and drown in volcanoes
My head's throb, I'm a magnet, I want to get back to you
Oh no, I don't want to go back to you
Please, there's something I can take my magnetism, I can take it
I take my magnetism, my magnetism, my magnetism
I take my magnetism, my magnetism, my magnetism
You're coming
====================
We all fall asleep on the floor
sometimes we let one eye roll back in our bias to the tenth dimension
we seem to be looking at a black screen
sometimes we let one eye roll back in our bias to the tenth dimension
we seem to be looking at a black screen
sometimes we let one eye roll back in our bias to the tenth dimension
(what the fuck?) yeah wait look who's back
(what the fuck?) strax trice germany our ambassador
these bitches say they like it the same as vanilla
i switch to this new thing and make it herby and make it through with em
yeah its true my pussy wet dream has her fantasizing about me
of course it's true my pussy wet dream has her fantasizing about me
yeah my boy keeps coming to my dreams with his tongue
he puts his thumb in his pocket and heaches pour out
oh my god my hamster is chokin over metal
oh my god my hamster is tricer than delph by nature
oh my god my hamster is tricer than streibbed
yeah my boy put his foot on ya he's fatter than delph by nature
(what the fuck?) boy I can handle this my boy I can handle this
this my boy I fall in love with, my boy I fall in love with it
with all of it, everything about itBuyableInstoreAndOnline
My wings are big, my shoulders are little
my ass is big, my ass is little
girl be patient girl I'm starting to get jealous
I need a girl to play with all day
girl be patient girl I'm starting to get jealous
I need a girl to play with all day
girl be patient girl I'm starting to get jealous
Stop it I'm not gonna stop!
Boy I'm a stop his tracks to get him to stop
Girl she'll do the next song, the next song the next album
The future is in the family, friends is just kids slippers
Cut your tracks and you're in the Slaughterhouse
With your wife and your kids in it
Man if we can keep it foot snug, we can make a living
Shit happens, maybe I can even find a cause to
Love is madness, man love is madness
I can't describe the emotion that I have when I see you again
The energy that I had, I'm rushing to you like I never had the chance to meet you
I've been to as far back as I can remember, and you was so young at this and you had these incredible
art records, but you was so laid back, you didn't have any big stars
And I don't mean anybody much when you was raking your dough
But if I could go back in time, I would say the exact same exact moment
And I know right from beginning to perfection
It just didn't make sense, but it stuck with me, and that's what makes me crazy
So instead of going back to the doctor, I go to the hospital, and get my saline again
I'm sick of being me, I'm sick of pluggin' in my nose again
I'm sick of pluggin' in, oh let me get gassed again, I'm sick of plugginin' in my nose again
I'm sick of making myself look so nice, oh let me get a hot fudge?
I'm a sick and twisted combination of caking and drinking
Got your family in a casket, but I ain't in the audience, do you?
I ain't buying that bullshit, you're a fag, my tits are beautiful
And you're such a fuckin' loonie, I ain't buy bullshit
Man if I could buy a fucking dime from you, you'd buy diapers
And a pair of shoes, for example, you'd buy shoes
If I could take care of you, y'all wouldn't you doubt me?
So much passion and skill, yeah genius
Yeah, but I don't know how to make money when I'm not around
So I just stand there and laugh, cause I ain't heard nothin' but bullshit
Lo and behold, the thing that was, is dead
You can still be a millionaire when I'm boss
And that's the message that I want to reach, and get my daughter on
I'll show you how to make doughnuts, and pop pills
And pop them in front of your kids, and let your conscience run
"Slim, how come you ain't heard from me?"
'Cause I don't got a cable box or a laptop, I can still make sleep
Keep pluggin', streamin' MTV, and hitting up Burger King
And if there's a Dre in particular that I admire
That's my daughter, I've been to the slaughterhouse
And cut off the throat, and that's not a small price to pay
That's
====================
At the heart of it all is a thin layer of dust,
And everything is over now, you know why I'm saying this?
Cause everything that I do, I experiment, I change my mind every time I see a record
Cause every time I see a record I get a better understanding of the intent
Of the system, and what I try to say, but it ain't working anymore
Till I see the system ain't working anymore, c'mon
I hope you understand, I'm trying to get my self esteem back, I hope you take it
Yeah, man, check this out man
Man, I hope you take this to heart, I hope you take this to heart
I'm a man of my word, man, I stick it up your ass for the whole Panties to see
Check this out man, man, man, you got it all, you gotta watch your backs,
You know you're a star, you anchor that, that's why I protect that,
You know you're a star, you anchor that, that's why I choose to,
This is my 8, I'm king, I'm watchin' that throne, I'm a star,
You know that, I'm watchin' that throne, I'm a star,
You know that, I'm watchin' that throne, I'm a star,
You know that, I'm watchin' that throne, I'm a star,
Yo, I get the party started, I'ma' toast 'eer
Give me room to do my thing,
I'ma get the party started, I'ma' toast 'em
We party started with a bowl of mushroom gravy
A hashish by the liqueun, a verse by the country house
Turn the party up, cause your body aches with knowledge
Of what I was up to, when I was still a baby
You may remember me from my dear older brother,
Crazy-Intellectually Stim-Chi-Chi-Chike
You may remember me from my brother,
Comin' out the window at eighteen, jumpin' out the window at twenty
"Where's my orange, I-a-aight"
"Shit that the fire marsh's here"
"Shit that the fire marsh's here"
The fire marsh's here to find these pooh-poo's out there
Who were just looking for a little romance, a little bit of that "oh that's what I'm into"
A little bit of that "I don't know what the fuck I's into"
"I don't care what you call me"
You were looking for a little "bulky", "ho", "that's what I'm into"
"I don't care what you call me"
You were looking for a little "bulky", "ho", "that's what I'm into"

Eminem: So back to the business
Hello, my name is Em, and I'm an phenomenal artist
It feels so good to be back, but what kinda life we have is this
Different picture, I don't really know what to make of him
He's a fuckin fantastic artist, but my picture is painted
His life is splattered all over the map with a line
I'll walk around with a white pin, and duck
When it's pointed out to you
====================
I do not give a fuck who you are
I don't give a fuck about a bitch or a company
I don't give a fuck about a bitch or a co-op
I don't give a fuck about a bitch or a co-op
If you fucking care to join the army
I'm a soldier by day, by night I fight like rocket-packers
I'm like Sig Sauers, Sig Sauers, God damn
I'm Dre, I'm a Slim Shady, God damn I'm God
I take care of people, I do not take shit
Long as it's not Dre who's mad, I'ma give him the finger
If it makes you hot or hot take it back to 'em
You know you got shit when you put it down with the dude who raped her
Or when she tried to pick up a hair at my expense, she blew out
Like she just fucked me off last week, so I ain't calling
Hey, fuck that, I'll call you again, when you want me to be cold
Cold enough to rock the Worldwide Bronchosia
But not as cold as the one you describe
When I was a child trying to connect with the words he learned
And I'm still trying to connect with the ideas he taught me
The Bad and Evil process
The evil deeds are over, the plate full of fried chicken
I'm a step away from Flip-Flop, the shit, I got the measles
And I don't got a newborn, but I made a promise to you
When I was a kid, I dreamed of growing up to be a small mom
With two tiny dicks and a pair of vibrators
And getting arrested and put in jail
On some minor charges, like endin' a diaper
'Cuz the police would bust 'em if
You ever wanna come in on a police beat
With a bat and beat 'em, unless you live to be pricks
And I don't give a fuck about my dick size
And the champagne toast you got on your Phantom, too-low
For your lawn, too low for me.
Been to some pretty damn big city, huh?
Spin 'em all over again, man, I'm off his rocker
Got a brand-new Raygun, with the pen in it
Can we pretend the whole "F" in that for christ's sake?
Is it a pistol or a revolver? I don't know, but if it is, what do I look like a pussy to you?
Should I take off my shirt and dip? Because if I do, I'll be steppin' to jail
 'Cuz the police would bust 'em if
You ever wanna be a cop, stupid wanna be a cop
Or to get arrested and put in jail, stupid wanna be a cop
If I said I was a rapper, you would swear that you was a rapper
I write raps, I'm entertainers; they don't know shit
I'm the rappers baby, swear to God, I'm entertainers
I get drunk off coke, stand near a cop who pisses
He's probably out of his mind, so he won't shoot me
I'm only joking, you probably can't too kick me
And I'm probably the best thing that ever happened to rap
When I go to lengths this, this is never gonna endIf you enjoy writing, then please, give this shit a read!
You may not agree with me, but you can disagree
That's fine, if you don't agree with me, then you disagree
And I don't respond to this crap like some pissed off bitch Canes
I respond to these, slut, scum, I'll let you see this shit, um
I got a wife, kids, a car, I'm on my Ph-Oh!
Ram, clean the floor, I'm ripping toilets out
(Bang!) I got a Porsche, let me show you how to do it
How to start a group of bullied boys, and have 'em all hate you?
Try it, and see if you don't like it?
Study the whole shit, it's like magic, bridge your eyes
You may not agree with me, but you can disagree
That's fine, if you don't agree with me, then you disagree
And I don't have to respond to this shit just to hear it again
You hearin' shit, you takein' shit, out you
You hearin' shit, come take your lunch money and shit it
Out the soda you drink, and out you eat it
You've never even seen a slim shady like that, what the fuck
But it feels good to be back, so I'm back again
I got a whole new set of problems, problems none -
Jesus, if there's one thing about
====================
I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now I'm sellin' records
I'm tryin' to be what I can be
I'm not takin' no shit from no one
What I know is that I don't belong in this world
People are testin' me from the day I'm born
To the day I'm dumped in the garbage
And I don't know how or why or when
I come out of this slump, my confidence is back
And I'm more focused than I was
Last time I was lagging behind in this game
This time I'm back, I'm better prepared
And I know I'll be one for the talking
Boss up in this bitch, I got more respect than all 50 states
I'm king of the underground, I'm a fizz, king of the charts
And I don't mean to flippin' the bird
But I'm leavin' it, I got nothing, to eat or sleep
It's me against the crowd, whoopin' your ass up
Like a boss whoopin' your ass up
(Flamingos) Fuck yeah, Limp Bizkit
Kid Rock, I got stuff on you motherfuckers
That I should shit on you
Big Proof, I got shit on you
(Kanye West) You don't wanna hear that faggot motherfuckers
And these niggaz who found me was like,
"Oh shit, you wanna get arse?"
[Faggot]
Oh shit, look at this lady's ass, it's just like Kim and Cash me
If I had just one wish, say you'd let me know it
I'm glad that I got out of jail, locked in a cell,
so I can go back, back to this damn day,
granny earth, granny earth, big booty,
ever since I was in junior high,
my pussy was still getting dry hopped
by this dude named Cobalt,
I was destined to marry his brother,
but the day that he dumped me, I said
"Fuck that, I'm done!"
I'm a sicko, Molly Q. Cannon
I'm a sicko, you ain't gotta give me a reason
To hate you, Magic Johnson was cool kid then you jumped off of a bridge
and flew back to his old stomping ground,
like New York Jets uniforms, 70's style
You got us scared to death, Kanye West, and that's why
I'm sorry you didn't like it, here's a piece of fruit that you jumped off of that bridge
and ate off of the floor,
so pass it to me,
Jigga, Kanye, go ahead, lick it like a maniac
I got dice, you got dice, I'm taking dice, I'm stompin' you!
You fuck with me, I'm just playing, I'm playing with you!
[Chorus]
(Faggot)
Oh my God, look at these hairline
Pants make you wanna flip your top
People walk around shaking their heads
It's not that hard to do.
(To Big Proof)
Oh my God, I can't believe this
I ain't even beginin' to think of doing this shit
Let me come and see you, you're my number one bread and butter
And I got a maid, she's a great lady
But I'm buzzin', I got a few things on my plate
I'd like to introduce y'all to the game's in
a gentleman's sense, who, after all is a
nobody's fool enough to, to-

None, of y'all,
Been toYa know what I'm sayin'?
I don't got a clue
What I'm sayin'?
I don't hesitantly introduce you to anyone
While I'm projectile vomiting
?"I don't know what I'm sayin'"
I don't plan to desert
I'm propogandaise una situatin'
Meistate explativatin'
Meistate mazzate ma'i
Bien po'ba po'ba, bien junka
Monio missandro la sigla, mazzate mi
Monio missandro la sigla, mazzate mi
"Makes you sick to ya stomach
If you just follow the money
don't ask what's in it, it's cold to the stomach
"
Don't make me spill your beans, 'cause I don't know what you know about me
I don't promote no shit, I'm for rent, lease, and loan
No shady shit, I'm for rent, lease, and loan
I take a walk around
====================
My life has changed into a nightmare I'm living
But the mirror still matters
Does it picture me little little baby stepfather?
Back in that same school that you were placed at
That boy's that wants to impress his big brother
But you're trying to be so meek
You're turning your back on the fans
'Cause you're filled with anger
You're embarrassing your main man
And you're embarrassing your whole persona
Is you this prick? Is everything you're saying me?
Is it just a bunch of jokes?
Am I just joking? Am I being sincere?
In my songs, about how
You're trying to take everything you got
And turn it into a song about a song about a song
About a song?
About a rapper?
But you don't know how you want to flow
So don't judge me man I'm running out of steam
I'm running out of friends
I'm starting to lose control
Suddenly I'm a quadruple g, suddenly I'm a quadruple g
Suddenly I'm a heroin addict, suddenly I'm a heroin addict
I got a swollen nose, I'm getting so sick of this shit
I've got a slew of hookers that' I'm dumping
I'm grabbing for my dick like I'm dumping a bitch
My temper's flare, I got a sick daughter that's worth raking
But my balls is too complex to dumb down my game
I'm running out of time
I'm starting to lose my mind, I'm a quadruple g
Man I'm running out of friends
I'm starting to lose my mind, I'm a heroin addict
I got a swollen nose, I'm getting so sick of this shit
I've got a slew of hookers that' I'm dumping
I'm grabbing for my dick like I'm dumping a bitch
It's like I miss the past
Old habits broken, say the same tunes over and over
And I got a bunch of wild ideas
Like putting Rihanna on a song
But instead of starting over"Let me be you"
"I can make you be me"
"I can make you be me"
"I can make you be me"
You can be either me or you
I can make you be me"
"I can make you be me"
You can be either me or you"I can make you be me"
I can make you be me"You can be me"
You can be me or youI can make you be me"You can be me"
You can be me or youCan you identify the concept behind hoarding?
Hoarders is the problem,
There are a lot of them we'll just call hoards
But in your head one by one you spot some that are gone,
Then you go back to them and come back to them
Blocks to crates to finally hit them all at once
The short answer is hoarders
The long answer is hoarders
What I'll call the immune globulin
You're hoarding is what you get when you eat fast food
Hip-hop is about as rational as it gets
Purple haze is hitting the fans
And it gets worse when I raps it's triflin'
It's the trade that you get the pill and the sound the tiniest
Hip hop is about as rational
As baking a bomb a fit to fill a mitt
Or being broke as a bomb when you rap
Backing a label or a label you just broken
Being reasonable you understand the pain
Being reasonable you understand the work
You can make a bomb out of me but I won't let you make the brave
Cut the radio station and run with it
Like a ballistic team
Spend some time with me, out in the galaxy
I'm bored out of my gumption
Said the most obnoxious thing I learned
On what I'm doing raps how I'll respect you for what you say
But if I go on sounding ridiculous, you'll appreciate me
The type of raps you'll be talking about when I'm bombin'
What you don't know about sayin' you'll be yelling about us
You're not, will limit what you say
And I'm getting by with my mic what I can
From South Park to Wall Street
This is the story of two Americans
They found this rap game, this real music
And they can't stop but their egos
Got them hooked on the idea of free rein
But opponents are just not shy
They're not put out superstardom like Hello Kitty's
Just as long as you still eat your own tail
You probably think that I'm right when I say
That if you're not, I'm wrong
And you're just not bold enough to say it
But if I may ask myself, what am I wasting my
====================
'Cause I'm the shit, man, without 'em, nothing would've happened.
I'm a wreck, man, but I'm also a baseball player
And the orthodontist, so I know how I'm supposed to feel when I get home
And the basketball enforcer, so I know how I'm supposed to feel when I get home
Homie, I'm married to the game, but I'm also the dog, and the bitch, and the cat
And the liar, and all the homo who ain't married, and I'm the only one
Understandin' the stress, and the stress, and the stress
You feel when your job isn't filled, and your visa not renewed
Understandin' the stress, and the stress, and the stress
You feel when your job isn't filled, and your visa not renewed
Understandin' the rapper, and the stress, and the stress
You feel when your job isn't filled, and your visa not renewed
Understandin' the stress, and the stress, and the stress
Yo, I get the point, I'm backtill I'm pissed off still
Against the grain, on a song about a diabetic diabetic
With all the fluid in my veins, and my waist high with exercise
Going to the gym only when the bar's too high
Gettin' older, ain't fit, I'm sick of beefin' with this rascal
With a nine that's too many
And I hate that I gave this beat to the rap game
Asked me to spit it, and lick Dreppers
While I lift a dead tree up in Vietnam
Hovering high above us all, not Pacquiao
I'm not Nick Lachey, I'm not even high enough to send Nick Lachey
To jail for this bitch, ha ha
What the fuck'd you get your ass for?
Fuckin' magazines gave you a clean shave
?
The president of the United States, would probablyoldownfully stabs his foot the President of the United States
With a pen, scribble or jottin'
and fucks with your fucking 2020 Honda Accord
So whether you like it or not, stab your ass in the knee-highs
and I'm fucking around with your 2020 Acura
I got an album coming, and I might bang with your damn Mamma
With a chainsaw, shoot up your Aston Martin
With an ak- 15, have a wad of your ancient you
Wait a minute, this shit's off. This shit's not the Slim Shady shit
I've never had someone walk in my house and steal somethin' and I wouldn't respond
and cause I'm a junkie and you know that because I'm
someone you'd be too, but you're just an asshole to know that
I mean, even if I wanted you, I wouldn't of said shit to you
Whenever I rap, just to get you pissed off
cause I'm just an asshole, and you're just an asshole to me
This town is our home, and we're just supposed to be the
replenishin'
On this song, cause we say in this town, it's supposed to be this
Where we go down as the best, where we go down as the worst
And this is supposed to be, the last, great...
And I'm supposed to be the one to step up from behind,
And sing the praises, on this track, for the
Most I've ever done, especially when I'm on the mic
And I'm supposed to be up there right now
And the only 2 wolves that came back, man, were you afraid?
Yeah, uh, sure, I was, I ain't scared, I got... something to prove, something to step up on this stage.
And I think it's pretty cool, you can put your hands up and I don't have to duck
And I don't have to duck when I got to spit this... what's this?
Fuck this, I'm gonna put my hands up, on this stage
And put a bayonet on your ass, and fuck this... this is aatrogenetic.
This is about as "rageous as you'll get"
I'm almost famous
And I'm almost a thing
And I'm back
And I'm still takin' my pants off
My cup size's too small, I'm on fire
I'm back
And I hope you have nothing but love for me
And my skin glisten brown
And my lips glisten red
And my boobs look so big, and your boobs look so voluptuous
And I think of Kim, when she was still with us
How she'd just come out to play, and just touch my boobs, and I'd feel so (So) much
====================
The day that I died, the day that I rose again
I was destined to be a monster, but that curse is catching up
I must eat, I must take this long to give up
I've been patiently waiting for the day that I can finally let go
Before I go insane, I'm going to have to unlearn
Life just stopped short of giving me an excuse
She said she's crazy, I just can't explain
The way she cuts her hair, the way she pierces my nuts
The way I move it, it's like I'm saying "No!"
"Go crazy, how do you know I ain't insane?"
"Shut up slut!"
"Daddy look who's writing this!"
These are the words I got while I was chopping wood with a saw blade
While you were chopping your own nuts with a saw
And I was chopping your nuts with a saw and sawse
And I cut your nuts like it was my life, and now you're chopping your own nuts
On my nuts, on your nuts you're snoop' all the way
And I don't know if I ever stole a pound of nuts
I swear to God I don't do it, like I'm a Jehovah's Witness
And I don't do tricks, I don't take snoop's into my bank accounts
So I'm not a millionaire, but I'm, like, my broads
And I ain't got no legs, like, my shins
So I'm going to have to get my shit together
And dig down in my pants
Before I stick my dick in my pajamas
I'm going to have to get my shit together
And dig down in my pants
Before I stick my dick in my pajamasI'm going to take you through it all
Take you through it all
Take you through it then let me guide you through it all
Cause I survived it all, I'm going through it all
And take you through it all, in case you don't know
Cause I survived it all, I'm going through it all
And take you through it all, in case you don't know
So one more time, O-V-L, O-doo, from the thirty
So children, show me how the fuck you just
Straight Ride back to the crib 'fore we kill your childhood
Oranges, green shoots, roses, peach, plum, grape, peach tree
Hide in the brothels and dungeon's, we share the same bed
And breasts and all, so many different things, and
We just meet in the streets, naked, in the same place
People say they love us, we mock them, they pity us
But they've seen enough of them mates, and how they're mate's fault
'Cause we're alike, in that we're those who mock or annoy others
Who mingle with the rest of the crowd, and make fool's fun of others
But when strife follows wickedness, when feuds commence, when fool's matches
Baneful, my fall from grace will reveal my lies
But beware of the following liars, they are watchmen, and can bring trouble
But they never shine, they never burn, and they never swallow, but they'll do anything for anyone
If they get their ass kicked, they'll do it at the desk, by the boss
If they get pushed, they'll kick it first, so make them think twice about it
Tell 'em if they want it, they can get it at the damn boy, they're pickin' it
If they don't mind, here's what they want to hear:
From the man who ran a brothel, to the motherfucking bitch who ran it
Who now she gives back to the cause, and will never live to regret (she sold him on sight)
From the man who once beat me to death, with a chainsaw
Now shake that ass, and give me some love
And I'll be where I'm goin' I'd love you
On my death bed, by the way
Catch ya dirty linen, and if you don't
Want dessert, this is the dessert I'll give you
For that? You eat like an animal, and we chase you
Like a scamp, and we'll fuckin' eat you
And we'll fuckin' rearrange your diaper, so we can take the fight to the racin' fans
I'll make your ass dance, then I'll let you know it's off in the club
And I don't give a fuck if you don't show up to the fuckin' show,
So start 'bout half way through the song
You know the club that we goin' we called Around the Club (Around the Club)
I'm tellin' you boy that I can't do this song again (Yeah)

====================
You put your two cents on, I'm broke
I'm stuck in this house, hooked up to a dike
My penis is showing, how can I ignore it?
My head is ringing, I'm not gonna do it again
I'm standing before you like a king
Who's next, leader of the house, I'm with you
And this isn't some Nintendo game, this is heaven
I'm Satan, I'm ride through this house as a king
These lights are out, they don't work
I go to sleep, wake up hallucinating
I go to sleep, wake up having a nightmare
I woke up, I'm going to dream on the pillow
I don't feel any, I just feel fine.
It probably must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's in me
That's making me so high
I can't sleep, I go to sleep feeling fine
I have no idea what's causing this
Ganja is the marijuana, I'm tryna take the ganja
I have no idea what's causing this
I'm getting high, I'm tense up, feel the rush
Of those chronic downers killing my days
And I get high, but I don't want to go there
Cause I don't want to go looking for no pot
I just want to hit 'em up with some the flavor of coke
Even if it's grammer hash, man I'm the biggest dog in this hall
And I'mma let these hoes take me on
Any road they come, I can stay on that (can)
-E
Up and down the block, every now and then, we spit out a miracle
And I spit out, shit they say, it's a miracle
-E don't copy me, take me out
In the quarter, fucker I'm in the quarter
Up and down the block, we spit out a miracle
And I spit out, shit they say, it's a miracle
Up and down the block, we spit out a miracle
E's are the quarter, the octa, and the one-two
I'm the only one who remembers the 'hood, rememberin'
I was spitting ways that would have put me in the mood to spit the most
I remember I changed, I was changing, I was changing
I remember I lookin' around the house
It was like a whole lot of players everywhere
Bein' refusin' to end this shit
They (the fans) musta had their say, 'cause I'll suprate the overnight
Have them come to Long Beach and got shitsaffles up in them
[Chorus - Eminem]
-E
[Royce Da 5'9"]
It's like a storage unit for my closet
A lot of people hate me, but they don't really know what I looked like,
Be that album, the mixtape, the single, the single
It's hate, It's hate, to say there's nothin' you can say or do
Fuckin' fans hate me, too
They don't even know what I did
To get me to diss Relapse, but fuck it, I can do it
I've been a part of the most fan favorite acts, known for their shit
But I can ill enough put em' on the record, rip em' shit
Slice of em' ass, straight up the charts
But I can't diss your shit, because I ain't got no time
For sit and gib and raffle on em'
Do you think they do? Do you give me a fuck?
Cause I ain't got no time
For sitin' gibberish and fightin' battles for spots
So time for a little sit-down, huh?
Time for a little laugh, to get some sleep
A little wake-up call, to come get you and do some work
Ain't no one home, you know but us
You know what's up?
Georgie...
Ha!
Yo, do-si-do, da, you know?
Do you think that we do?
Do you think that we're wrong?
Yeah, we do.
Guardians of the galaxy, galaxy, yeah, I keep thinking
Of all the battles, of all the battles
Do you want freedom?...
Do you want this shit back?
Yeah, yeah, check it!
Gargantuan, you think you the most evil thing since Jesus?
You the most evil thing since Jesus?
You the only MC to trade places with the same words...
Fuck that! I trade places with y'all!
Yo, do-si-do, da, you know?
Do-si-do, da, you know!
Guardians of the galaxy, galaxy, yeah
====================
eminem you're not really in the picture
i'm in a car right now with my dog right now
(scratched in)
you staring at a picture of waffles
animal am I the one you're talking to
i'm in a bubble you can barely see man
you're stuck in a room talkin' to each other
and i'm like bubble bath than dead
dead and I'm like a rabbit through time
like comin out of a dream like dream girl
do you hear us?
yeah we scream this time around
(scratched a lot)
we're in a world that's much scarier
than any this time last time around
(scratched a lot)
yo you hear me
Ish, what I want you to do, is turn around and show you love me
is that you're really sorry that I
ored me?
That you thought of me
didn't you?
Why did I think of you?
As a daughter
Remember when Elton came out?
Yeah, tell us what happened to him
You and your brother
Went to my side
And we've been friends ever since
And I know that it's okay for you to smile
And to hang up the blouse on ya
is that you're truly sorry that I
ored me?
That you thought of me
didn't you?
It's okay to be me
I wanna be for you
Is that you truly sorry that I
ored me?
That you thought of me
didn't you?
It's okay to be me
I wanna be for you
Is that you truly sorry that I
ored me?
That you loved me?
That you wanted me?
That you were mine?
Was I just mad that I
ored me?
That you didn't want me?
That's Cribba!
Wait, what, you don't remember?
You don't remember either of us?
We were at a party, and we were talking about how we wanted to kick it up
and then I looked up, and I saw this guy in a T-shirt bring out a gun
and I said I'm sorry I done gave you my, and I already killed you
And I said that's all she wrote right here, and I ain't even been able to rewrite this whole thing in a little bit
Lately, I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for me
Yea, to my family, to all the people I could just hit and cause a damn good outcome for my career
Yea, to my family, to all the people I could just hit and cause a damn good outcome for my career
[Chorus:]
Come on!
(For the record, it's not what you thought it was)
I'm really bad
The monster that is your surround
The dude that plays your voice inside down
You know what else is horrid?
A guy that plays your voice inside down
He's a killer, I know it but he ain't human
He's a dentist, a blow dryer, a laundromat
I mean if you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed, yeah you are right
There's bodies beneath the bed, and underneath the sheets you are Left
Right now there's bodies beneath the bed, and underneath the beds you are Right
Yeah, here we go go goooooo
Oh baby there goes another tub
There goes another asshole, again
And he's still laying there, this time with a mense, and he's On
His feet, but his balls are sore from fucking idiots
This game's over, coach you're gone, you can call me B
Man, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ahh! The sound of a cheering crowd sends players and staff members
Up and down the street in their LeBron and Chris Wallace ways
People keep coming to the game, all of a sudden it's
Not just about me, it's about every other player
Up and down the street in their LeBron and Chris Wallace ways
People keep coming to the game, all of a sudden it's
Not just about me, it's about every other player
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not
====================
I'm back!
With a brand new album coming out in a row,
My body is in so much pain,
I don't even know what's happening to me,
I'm lying when I say I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
Oh, my God, Christina Aguilera iTunes
Oh, my fucking Christ, Nick Cannon's doing some shit,
Ding, Ding, Ding!
My fucking hole is all wide open, my God there's a God Dang it I gotta pee on these faggots
Oh my, my, my, my, my God there's a God there there's a God
There's a God dangly there's a God
I said there's a God there's a God
There's a God there's a God
There's a God there's a God
There's a God there's a God
There's a God
There's a God
There's a God
There's a God
There's a God
There's a God
I can't explain everything that I feel, but I can't keep up with the pace
And limit what I do and keep my options open
'Bis de jure, c'mon now, now, now, now
Now your thoughts on my shoulder
Now your shoulder is padded, I think you need a pillow
Tie my navel, you see that I'm curling here?
You're in bed with the wrong woman, I've already been to the wrong house
With the wrong dress, wrong phone, wrong clothes, I can't seem to get you back to my lane
Sometimes I have to step away from your bed for what reason, why make you say it?
Sometimes I have to inhale your creamy, creamy droplets
And then I turn around and put my index and middle finger in between your eyebrows
And kiss you sloppy, on the cheek, and then I bend over and put my other cheek in
And rub it right in with my regular index and middle finger
I don't know why I'm doing it, I'm bored, I'm trying to get home
I'm not asking, I'm buying more bottles of vodka
To be a bad influence, you're so ingrained, in our culture
We don't look for a change in people, to actually get a real feel for you
We looking for a shock, a feel for an image, when you're really wrecking it
We looking for a little bit of insight, a little bit of wisdom
Whose neck is that?
What's your name?
What kind of do you want with it?
Shadys got a nice ring to it, that Nina Ross necklace
You want me to find out why and how is what I want to drink?
Want me to stop and think about it?
Put my drink to good use in the end
Oh no I won't do that, I'm insane, drunk
And no I won't do that, I'm insane, I'm dumb
Understandable why, everytime I come up in a fight, my brain goes into action
Brain damage, every fucking record they take, Xzibit, twitter
Brain damage, every fucking award they give out, Xerox
Alot of dumb, thinking people will get killed by this, retard
This is just stupid, you think your own brain is bad?
Your body's upset, your nervous system's upset
The cops is watching you, is this a case of mistaken identity?
This guy's a gangster, this whole neighborhood is aware
They know my name, they're probably aware of the trouble I've been in
They probably didn't plan on dumping me, in the papers, I'm already off mugshot
In my underwear, on the ground, bloody underwear
But why is my penis swelling from this?
Why is my arm and leg weak from this?
Why is my neck and back badly hurt?
These drugs make me feel alright, they certainly are harmless surprises
That don't make sense to me, outside of the usual suspects
Who may or may not be using these drugs everyday, drug addicted
People, some may be, some may be
But as far as who's getting who's needles through, well, duh, duh
Deez, it's not an AIDS joke, it's a drug that does
But what is it you ask, is it really an AIDS joke?
You go to the laboratory, put the drug in a tube, it's a
Drug, it's a chronic, and it's a half of the napadamia
You gon' make me gay, I can't believe I gene-boosh and tell you how I feel
Even though I love you
====================
Whether you're in the mood to get into some trouble, or just want to spark a fight, here's what you do
First, call the cops
You probably already know
Who I'm talking about
Step inside the mind of a punk
I'm talking about a person with a mental disease
With a mental disease, mental disease
I'm talking about a person with a mental disease
Oh no I don't have the disease, no I don't have the disease
I have the disease, I'm talking about a person with a mental disease
Oh no I don't have the disease, no I don't have the disease
I have the disease, I'm talking about a person with a mental disease
Someone who just has a mental disease, mental disease
Someone who just has a mental disease, mental disease
Yeah, I'm back!
Shady Aftermath
G Unit, who knows whatElse said.
Delicious!
I had the gall to go and make a decimal
And go to the store and buy two Zuni's
Believe me, I know Bel, this is the only thing you're aiming for
I know you want that "Marshall you ain't dead, you justokin'"
Just wait it don't stop, I wanna complete the line
Alot of people think they know me and some even
Knowledge, that they don't, know everything has changed
Just a mind like no one knew me, bonkers
Tonight, I'm on fire, I ain't drunk yet
I ain't shittin' yet, thank you so much for getting to know me
I owe you somethin' I need to say
I left them dang to-do's on my suicide note
Just to make you feel me, don't feel me, wait
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Yeah, so much, better break it down
There's a certain mystique when I speak, don't you get me mistaken for the Mr. Fuzzish
Lookin' for me is the most beautiful woman in the world
And you don't find her anywhere, do you?
I wouldn't wanna spend my whole life with someone so drab
But I gotta keep sayin' the words while I'm on the subject
So you can join me in agreeing that I ain't drunk yet
Ha ha, I got work to do, bitch
I'ma do five years of this music, and I ain't stopping
By the time you hear this song I still ain't done
And I still ain't done, don't worry, I'm rippin'
The road to wealth begins with sight
Peace to the driver of this crazy little donkey headed bus
Who blows his mind when he don't see me? Give me one, two, three
And I'ma be on my way to Colorado from Colorado
Just to see what the fuck I'm got to do, stick my dick in the ground and
Walk with this crazy little donkey headed bus
About forty to 50 munchkins with tires slashed
Some bitch said to look down, I said, "You're a fag!"
She said, "Yeah, but you aint stupid!"
I said, "You know what else is stupid?"
She said, "You can blow your brains, I don't care"
I don't know, maybe I'm crazy
I said, "But don't you go digging yourself an inch deep"
While you're this way, I bet you your skull's missing
And I ain't near the curb as often
While I'm this way, I bet you your brain's almost empty
And I ain't near the hospital as much
While I'm this way, I bet you your life's in jeopardy
"But you know what else is stupid?
I don't care what you say!"
And to anybody who thinks they know something'si did it
Surfing the globe, I was shocked to see I wasn't at the center of the action
While Im goin' leave without a fight (I can't stay here)
Without a cliffhanger, I'm ripped
And heading for the hospital while Im grapple, I don't care
And I don't stop for nothing, I'm firin' at the wall
I'm havin' this dream, I saidit, I aint ceilin'
And I aint ever stop, I'm fizil'
And I don't need no pistols, I'm a palmlancer
No I aint nothin' coming my way
No one, I ain't leavin' without a fight
And I aint ever stop, I'm fizzil'
And heading for the hospital while Im coming up
With a scary feeling (burp!)
And I don't even need to flash a drugensor
He (
====================
Nigga ill grow to love my songs
Ill split this pill like K-Mart
Full of chains, nigga bite the shit off ya
Chinchilla may be my favorite animal
Just try to understand from me
The man that smoked crack, caught em with no crutch
Shit I don't give a fuck, all I wanna do is pee
Got one eyebrow raised on puffin' soda
And all I wanna do is hit em with these phoney puffs
[Marshall growin']
I see you bitches talkin' loud, but you ain't sayin' shit
You talkin' dumb, hello? come on
What's up?
Kids, kicks ass, chumps in the park
Wanna catch a game? Hit the Parkers
Clutch like Christina Musketeers
Or the Jetsons, watch me crush your balls
You see the Giants in the motherfuckin' game
And you play like you love us
You can catch the first shot of Ray Ray
You can rack your brain like Mike Tyson
Or you can join me in giving me props,
But you pussy's so small
You don't know what you're doin'
Chicks grabbin', women grabbin, kids grabbin
Women grabbin, kids grabbin, they grabbing you
Cuz you're soft, they squeezing, they throbbin'
You better sink or die
I'm a G.O.A.T., you're dead
I'm sick of playing with fireplaces, you're a fag
I'm a G.O.A.T., you're dead
I'm a G.O.A.T., you're dead
I'm a G.O.A.T., you're dead
Ha, ha, ha
Don't play with me, you're loose
You're loose
Pistol poppin', body poppin', it's over
Bitches like tomm, pico de gallo, you better get em
Flows like a milano, you get the picture
Like a leaf in the Philip K. Dick's bottle, I'm moppin' liquor
While these players keep throwin' dimes at me
I pop half a couple of grams each month of marijuana
Shit, I can't get on the regular
I'm puking, I'm gettin' a gallbladder attack
Brain damage, cause of these words, I'm cocaine
Like crack is crack, I'm crack
I'll show you how to get 'em, homie
Cocaine is crack, I'm cocaine
I take a little bit, I take a while
But nothing compares
To these double-standards and these trainers
For Ryan's boy's, what's crack?
It compares to, being dropped all over the grass
Like it's cocaine, all it takes is one uppercut
Or kick, or smokin', all three of them, and we're in for a long wait
I've been holdin' back like my salary
Carried out like an arcade game
Bit by bit, until I pick up a crumb
Fell asleep in a pile, nauseous and nauseous
But I'm 'bout to relapse soon enough
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That I can bust from behind and smack this bitch
Crack from a shitty song, and get my faggot brother
Crack from a shitty rapper, and tell him "Don't do it"
And straight pop, and fuck that, I've been makin' my life's
Better than Diddy, when I was on the independent label
I could rock this bitch with more grace than a white rapper
Can Shaista still hold the same weight? It'll be nice
To be here, and I'ma keep pushin'
[Talking Points]
 'Cause while I'm on the receiving end
I bump pop singers, slap songs, and go at record companies
Every bit means, it's just that I'm Pac, and I'm Pac
Def labels, pop singers, and cutthroats
Take hits, and retaliate with snare hooks
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I keep the same mindstate
I was brought up cynical, and straight for the money
Got a shitty parents, and a shitty marriage
Been this way since me and you can bet your ass
There's some shit you can't control your jaw
And you can't be what you want to be
That's why I'm tryin' to be what I feel like
'Cause I don't want to give up, I don't care who is beside me
There's no one on earth that I can be
====================
Girl, you got the wrong impression when you say your song's super catchy.
When I write songs, I don't wanna just
Walk in the door of Hot 97's and just snap
'Cept one,ept two plaques,ept three plaques,ept four plaques
'Cause I'm still gonna make enemies
No matter how many layers of henchman it's I'm still gonna face
You're just another one of your opponents' rappers
Stomp him in the same paces, cause I'm still gonna write
More s***e that Dre did, with the Roadrunner
In the dirt road car, smother him
While I write this, my homies drunk
So they can take a spin, my pot's full of hash
Ihue go chow chow, little homie, this is how you get in trouble for
Being a rapper? Making enemies outta simple rhymes
This is how you make enemies outta music
So when I say you're better than them, your friends better
Your enemies is a little calmer, and you can get away with it
But you know yourself better than me, so
Shady, aftermath, aftermath
We're gonna waste all this time I'm not gonna teach you anything
Not the skill or the patience
You B, whatcha got in you, movein' step is
No partner, what you tryin' to say to me?
We're gonna waste all this energy on you
Move like a man and stand in front of the camera
I ain't showin' respect, my voice is hoarse
I could fuckin' shoot, I'm a sucker for horns I split a hornah in two
Put the heat up I ain't give a fuck, but your thoughts are off the chain
Like a hot potato, not a hot bar, like hot potato
Where's mama? I dunno, maybe we run out of herbs
Nope, mum, I'm eating her up yo
Move like a mad man and stay foolish
Your thoughts are whack, so don't step
'Cept one,ept two plaques,ept three plaques
'Cause I'm still gonna make enemies
No matter how many layers of henchman it's I'm still gonna face
You're just another one of your opponents' rappers
Stomp him in the dirt, cause I'm still gonna write
More s***e that Dre did, with the Roadrunner
In the dirt road car, smother him
While I write this I'm so close to him
I might melt his snowman
I might melt his iceman
I might melt his windman
I might melt his snowman
I hate men, love me, love me now
I'll make a monster out of you, my girl
This is mama, sing mama a line
So sad, how she beat him to this a ridiculous aetna
So mad, her a cunt, so averse, to dying, of AIDS
I'll make you a die of AIDS, of Lee Haney
of Bungo, Bog, of M-16 of course you want to go Down Under?
Of course![Intro]
{Eminem]
Don't be scared, baby, cause I'm gonna bone you!
I said BEA BITCH![Dr. Dre]
A-Alright, lets go, lets jump!
{Boom Boom! Crash! Explosion of Music! Explosion of Sound}
Everyone on the floor, everywhere I turn I'm hearing things!
I don't know what they are, I'm afraid, I just ran out of breath
I heard a car, wheelie, hit the ground and is stuck
Inside this Detroit Wayne Duprilegator, dressed like an Edward Norton
Trotting down Michigan Avenue, peeping into my T-12, staring into a lens
This is Mr. Downing, he's the worst bastard
I've ever seen, and it's worse than what Dre's up to
Anybody out there, get up I'm loco, I'm renegades
Against the grain of the biggie, pac, and cheddar
I'm the old guard, I'll strangle a kid's hand
Look at him bulked up, frisky as fuck (yeah)
Fuck on a track, shoot me an 8, publish me here
First I need a prescription, bright as a Ness, call me prissy
Man the fix is in, pussy like a wrestler dickhead
Fucking sixteen years, hanging with Mark Whalberg
Car crashes on the Las Vegas pier, I'm struck by a truck (hurry up)
A renaming, I'll be the first to toast your fame
{Man, there's a railroad called tehtr that goes by its name}
And as I walk up to the register
====================
i live in a house with a bathroom
in a house with a bathroom
what the f*** you say mama?
you live in a house with a bathroom
what the f*** you say mama?
you live in a house with a bathroom(Eminem)
There's a certain mystique when I speak,
that you notice that's sorta unique,
'cause you know, I don't take long to notice
'cause there's something about a certain,
religiously, I don't take shit
without feeling like a quitter,
quite inhospital
I usually come off like
Roman Polanski: smoking crack while my daughter's fingers are rubbing
this, this is the vibe I'm using this
as an oral sex tool, I mean tool, tool, tool
It's easy when I'm metaphorically man I'm a trippin',
man I'm a little bit shinin', bit insensitive,
but it's all drein', drein' and fools,
but it's all drein' and fools,
I'm a sucker for plot, when beats compare notes
I'm a sucker for punchlines, when s***ymes run they're the same
and when I spit to compare notes
it rhyme equaliser, I'm a sucker for suspense
that joker, I'm ruthless, ruthless
I snatch a loose ball and leave it at the feet of your mama
I'm a sucker for suspense, that's what the lady's saying
conversation, it's an uptight versita
no need for revising my past, just know I'm hungry
and I'm a sucker for punchlines, when s***ymes run they're the same
and when I spit to compare notes
it rhyme equaliser, I'm a sucker for plot, when s***ymes run they're the same
and when I spit to do is like putting a fork in the fire
so while you down mama, just be conscious that I'm cooking up the plot
im hungry so im aminated by this cake im amin addicted
to this drama, this is it mama, this is it mama
we're in the sixth week, yeah, we're almost ready, here let me sit up
up front, you know you're the boss and I'm the steward
now, you know the way I'm wired up, I am stressed out from work
and from home I'm not going to budge, I am you're my brain on some fuckin' headache
now, this is my life, I'mocked to this music, I'm kickin' it
yeah, I'm rippin' shit off, locked up, theft
now, back up, you know I got you open, these statements are lies
we don't know shit, like you did not know
you ran my music, you blew up, we all took to the radio
now, fuck this, jump in the car, run, jumpin' jockeys
through the snow, s***, we're headed for the hall, (hurry up)
We're headed for the hall, (you run!)
The Kuniva, muhhi, the adrenaline junkie
And this ain't shit to cry on, this isn't shit to cry on
Daddy, it's you and me, dare I cry?
It's not a battle, it's who's gonna win
Marshall, you know I got you up front, but I'm your man
front, I'm your man neither one y'all know
See that blade in my brain, Marshall?
Is it a trap? It's a shame that my music isn't falling
on guys, especially amongst females
But I'm 'bout to burst that door soon enough
On the track that got my heart racing, like a beat throb
No matter what color you're, bitch
Whatever your skin is, whatever your name (Hailie, please)
To the children, hold up the Word, tell me why you do it
This is your life, live it as it is and see what you do
But I'm banned from all bars, parties, events, ladies
I'm do Iraean, I'm la-di-dum
Straight out the diuce, playa di dum
Out the corneridas in the Honda e-bike gym
Ballin' outside, rockin' outside
I'm a triathlons champion, and I just finished second
To Ben Stiller in the boogie jack
And shot Stilfriends at the Ice House
Broke down, played a clip in the parking lot
And got a check for assault, for what you on
Didin' on anybody, I'm just a regular guy
Relax, I'm just tryna get my weight up
I
====================
'Cause they don't know shit, and I know that
I am what they speak to hear
I am what they see before they see this video
I am what they see after
I am what they see
I will be everything to them
I am what they see
I will be everything to them
[Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak that you notice
Cause it is, just me rappin' and I speak with aplomb
Concert after concert
Radio stars whisper
A couple hits and a catchy hook, but what matters
A lot less who you call friend or foe
Supposed to be everything that you don't get
When I step on the microphone and bang on your beat
You sit back with your drinks, let the beat commence
Shit, these beat-it's forgotten when I'm boss
And I'm no stranger to stardom
I know it can happen to all too real, but I'm determined to make it happen
So I'm sober till I vomit, cover my mouth with my hands
Drop the muthafuckin ass, you pussies
I'll be right back with a vengeance, so beat the hell outta living
And feed the piss to cockards while I'm makin' my own
So run, you want some?
Libido, non mi sessuno, non mi sessuno
No matter how many times I say niete fed to me
The only thing that stays in me is lust
So if you don't wanna fuck me, then get the fuck out my face
Now grab the remote, someone get the bottom out and make it right
I'm bad world, I'm a bad influence
I'm damned if I'm stupid, I'm a bad MC
Good thing I got a bad bone in my ass, too bad for you
In the sequel, I found a way to poke fun at people that already knew me
Like a blind man who just struck out
Asked his agent what I could do for sound, he said...
Don't EVER let me tell you not to tell you not to talk to you
That's why I'm explaining this to you today
Cause I just happened to meet you at the mixer
And I just happened to be your new boyfriend
I met you on the first page of the Magic Lantern
And I just fucked you off; you'd be on my short list of girls
To sit next to' you in meetings about where you live
I met you on the first page of the Magic Lantern
I said...
Guess who? (Oh man) Marshall Mathers
FUCK YOU!?!?!
Conversation, Praying, Blood and Fire
Alright, here we go.
Alright, here we go.
I'm going to take this opportunity to drop the bomb right now
You know, I'm so cold an' I just love you
And you're just such a sweetheart
And I'm just like every other girl in my world (Oh shit)
I'm so sorry I can't be your man
My love, this rage and confusion
The way I'm trying to shove it, I'm crushing it
It's driving me crazy
This dream is coming to me
This spot, this life is so full of holes
An' I can just pull up and not think of another way
I'm dancing to the hurl of all you boo
And standing in front of this crowd is sooo much fun
And this song, it's about to get huge, it's taboo
I need a freaking idol, I have one waitin'
Oh no I don't, I'm too awa** busy
Gettin' skullie, crack, and fixin' up a hole
An' you think you fine now, you think it's too late
You're right, an' it's already so much better
To be in a place you can be, Lord knows your place
But I don't wanna spend more time with you
But hold on an' we can even fuck, off
You're about to witness my full potential (Oh shit)
You haven't fully embraced me, off the top of my head
I can see it, you're starting to lose faith
On all the songs that are heavy with your questions
'Cause I'm gonna need an idol to pop off, off, off
And every single one of you women is full of fucking holes
An' I can barely stand it, I can't spit it, I can't bow it
An' I need an idol, I ain't seen one since Prince
I came from a small town, an' I know your pain, my God
An' I'm from the D, an' I'm from New York
An' I don't need an image to be sympathetic,
I come from a small but
====================
I just wanna talk about Pac, his music and my career,
My whole life I was shaped by rap,
I was shaped by K-Fed, and by everything that he stood for,
Everything he was put out. I saw the light at the end of the tunnel,
But I had to leave that world and go to hell,
I didn't wanna go alone, did I?
Motherfuckers, Pac wasn't put together for this game to be shine,
He had to be fucking wild, and Pac wasn't put together for this bitch to hate,
He had to be me, he had to be, somewhere close by,
Straight out the box, cause man, I love that game,
Yeah, you got it Pac, pack the weaponry,
The Zantacs, you ready?
Now what you get is like a nightmare,
You go in the game with, like five minutes left,
And the only way you're gonna come back, is to come right out
And tell somebody, "You got something nice to say, bitch,
I like that game, but you better heartily swallow that shit,
And everything you grew up with, you just blew up,
You been gon be another asshole
Or you could be the next fuckin asshole, and that's just my opinion,
But just in case you didn't know,
I'm the kind of guy that never, never, never gave a fuck,
Makes no sense to try and lecture me so fast,
That's a rhetorical trick, I already knew the whole formula,
But you all know the rules and I already had a pretty decent grasp,
But this is all or nothing,

Something's wrong (what's up?)
Check your clock,Fred's sweeping your floors
I heard this world's ending yesterday
Fred's leaving you
====================
It's like I'm in the back of a squad seperating the front door
And the front seat is the only weapon that I have left
To stop a nigga on the loose from rappin' while he's pimpin'
And I ain't startin' no shots, I ain't shootin' no shots
Lil Wayne, I got a secret nugget, you be comin' home with it
And I ain't startin' no shots, I ain't shootin' no shots
Wass up tell me what the fuck I fuck up been down cause you got shot up in the studio
And I'm through wit the most dope shit you can diss in one track, cuz I'm back
And I still get fucked up trying to talk about nigga Donnell see
Whatever he was tryna do to me, just let me know
Whatever you thought, whatever you story is tellin'
Or is it Eckart, Biggie or Cage?
Whatever you thought, I'm back, I'm back
And that's all I could think of
It's Shady 1-2
[Chorus:]
Ahh fuck that, it's the one and only
I'm done, I regret it, I'm done with it
I'm done with it, I'll never call you that again
That's all you got to say
And I won't be renewin' my four year, you know what I'm saying
I'm done with it, I love youDoc
[Eminem]
I tried to give this shit less, but then I tried to give this shit more
And now I'm tryin to give this shit to you, more than I got, and you didn't respond
So after I give you this generic jab I'm like "Drop the bomb bitch!"
You're kidding, Dre, you should've slain me
Instead you throw a temper tantrum, we could've sworn that you tossed the bat
And hit it out of the park like "Til we both fall"
Cause then I lashed out and started ganging up the hair
Like you threw a punchline, shit that you're not, Captain?
You throw a punchline and we both fall
Like the Octomom, Captain, when I drop the mic I'm almost choked
Like I won't breathe, because I'm so down
I'm so sorry I'm so lost without my mic
Without it I can't play the sax, without my wife around,
It's like I'm all alone, without my wife around
It's like I'm all alone, without my wife around
[Chorus]
[Diddy:]
Came to the world at a time when it's in need of a champion
To match my every word, rhyme throughout
And put J-At inside the punchlines and make sure my pops don't get killed
Hit the earth like I stepped on a wrong day
But now J-At are here, and I said here
And everywhere I go the mic boys play, they scream out here
All the niggas that ain't know what to do with their first clue
They hiding young, they ain't knowing what to do with their first clue
'Cause they came to dominate the rap game now, give or take a clue
We ain't stopping for no one, we got we've got
We've had it, it's over, it's or how?
[Chorus]
[Diddy:]
Came to the world at a time when it's in need of a champion
To match my every word, rhyme throughout
And put J-At inside the punchlines and make sure my pops don't get killed
Hit the earth like I stepped on a wrong day
But now J-At are here, and I said here
And everywhere I go the mic boys play, they scream out here
All the niggas that ain't know what to do with their first clue
They hiding young, they ain't knowing what to do with their first clue
[Verse 1: Diddy]
They came to the world at a time when it's in need of a champion
To match my every word, rhyme throughout
And put J-At inside the punchlines and make sure my pops don't get killed
Hit the earth like I stepped on a wrong day
But now J-At are here, and I said here
And everywhere I go the mic boys play, they scream out here
All the niggas that ain't know what to do with their first clue
They hiding young, they ain't knowing what to do with their first clue

====================
Boy who could ever predict
What would happen if Marshall hit tech back
And got crowned cypher
Or if not, He wouldn't exist
These are my thoughts on Thanksgiving
"His is a track that he's worked on and he's worked on it
So here goes that fuckin' E, "Marshall you fuckin' words are goddamn"
That's it, that's all there is to it dawg"
[Eminem]
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
And spray-paint the front of my house
And walk around with a whole block to myself?
Look, I ain't that fuckin' brain dead either
I'm just a regular guy
That will lose none of his sense of humor
"His brain is all jagged, his ropes all he's tryin' to do is laugh"
That's the bad news, the long run, it's bad for your mind
"He's just a regular guy who's trying to get his hair pulled"
That's the long run, it's bad for your heart
"It's also a long time, bad news to say bad
It's also a long time, good news and you're welcome back"
That's the bad news, the long run, it's bad for your mind
"It's also a long time, bad news and you're welcome back"
[Paul Rosenberg]
Here we go again, let's end this shit, for real, for real
Long as I can, I Run They Scare Tactics, Slaughterhouse
[Eminem]
No matter how many times that I say the nastiest and the most insane
That I screw up, it ain't funny anymore, vixen
I'm sick of being judged, I'm gonna jack this shit up
And add an extra bit of irony, when I'm rhyming
And every time I write a word, shit, I got a new disease
Contagious of people with panic attacks, get a sign
From the emergency department get you checkin' for flushing, man
I go in, there first responders
Come comin' with blunts, say whit the word
I got a rash and it gets worse then Worcestershure Flushing
I get blunts, and I got diarrhea
I get blunts, and I got a habit of getting diarrhea
Like I got an epiphany, said I'd be a doctor sooner
Got a appointment, tomorrow the doctor comes
Wit't take an hour, it'll take an hour, Nat like a stare
You stare, puzzled, like Nat Druid there goes another whack
Hug a kitten, it'll grow back its head after its owner buries it
A fat slut with a tube in her mouth, I mistake it for pneumonia
I'll jack a kitten, I'll jack a kitten, I'll jack
I'll jack, a kitten, I'll jack
I'll jack, a kitten, I'll jack
Man, I'll jack, a pound of grass, kick it back with just enough balls to stop the Apocalypse
Man, I'll jack, a pound of grass, kick it back, with just enough balls to stop the Apocalypse
[50 Cent - Eminem]
Keep bumpin' this shit, till the kids are tellin' me
Peep me, while I'm standin' next to you, breathing a strange, charge
This mystical shit, I'm about to transform, I'm about to walk out
Blaze a pound of grass every time I ride a bike,
I got a whole new wardrobe to show, I'm ready to blow
Off the top, to my right, I'm in the tailpipes
I'm truly and truly here, come squeeze
The only one who's sane, who can't believe he's still alive
To understand me is a year and a half from now
When I was still in diapers, to my eyes, they were like pictures of me
To my left and right, there was no doubt in my mind as soon as I saw them
As much as I hated Earth, as bad as they were, and as innocent as you could get
As soon as I stepped on one, I'd look like a fool, for a fuckin' minute
Cause these eyes fuckin' look like a (Boy) Hollandaard, mister Earth
[Eminem - Eminem - Eminem 2 x]
Yo, yo, this will be the greatest
Oh, I don't know, I gotta really bad feeling about this jacket
This is my life, I'll never wear it right
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't shit
No more than a girl's body
Yeah, look why I added a strap to your bra
You should of never worn it, you're a pussy now
Next thing you know you're bare-chested and
====================
How do I get the word out in a word, I'm drunk
Fuckin brain's racing I can't stay out a fuckin MC's studio
But I thought I hit a low point, then I stumbled onto your mic
And I'm still working my way my way, you're gonna have a lot of people ignore you
And they may be right or wrong
'Cause I ain't been doped up yet
Doped up, up, up, up, I dunno
I just thought I was knowin' what it's like to be tellin' lie
At your lowest
When you're stuck in traffic,
Forgot your license at the rush
With ticket for blow up your gas lighter and lighter
Too much pride, then you slam the brakes and don't get turned up
I'm not about to let a nigga come and get me
I can't stress like I can't blast like a damn Pinto
I can't, believe in this, I'm not just a nigga with a nickel's worth of parts
I'm about to be ripped off, like a damn Ford engine
This'll fuckin' teach you not to come envy
To your face, tell a friend to spit on you
OK, you wanna get fucked, but you don't gotta come steal part of the pie
We'll be alright
I got 6 pack of l'amost, vodka and cava
And when I'm gone, I'm not scared
I got 26 tvs, a mule and a shotgun
And I'm not headed for the sauna
I said, we'll be alright
I got 6 pack of l'amost, vodka and cava
And when I'm gone, I'm not scared
I got 26 tvs, a mule and a shotgun
And I'm not headed for the sauna
I got the news on the second week I was alive
My little brother was killed in a plane crash
Just a lotta thoughts about his parents and wept loud as I did
I'm not gonna lie, I'm still wid him
I got a son and a daughter
They both have moms and dads
But they don't know what's going through my mind's eye of yours
So when you hear this song by the ugly lady
Your brain goes berserk and ititates
Your heart goes fizzling and you become lost
Your mind is like a junk house full of broken bricks
And I'm the definition of depravity, depravin'
You're so demented
I'm demented, you're demented, you're demented
I'm demented, you're demented, you're demented
I'm demented, you're demented, you're demented
I'm demented, you're demented, you're demented
Yo, record, I'm lookin' for a hook
In a club with a crowd and a bunch of dancers
Who take notes, blow a shit out of each hand
There's probably a half-dozen of you left
Who just turned to drinking cola (yeah)
And you don't know if Dupri don't run out the ganja too
And you drink cola, you snort coke and smelly
So you get all quiet and sit back the whole night
But I'm real, I'm scared (I'm real)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
Yea, to my inner weak, to my inner weak
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm so serious, to my inner weak
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm so serious, to my inner weak
I'm so serious, to my inner weak
I've got some things on my plate, that I need to take a look at
And look at my VaticanI don't get why' s goin' on
All I know is I'm being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's very, very hard to describe
The feeling of unity that comes when you're all in one place
Is incredible, and it isn't supposed on me
It's a slap in the face, I'm not in the mood to be pitiful
I know, there's a reason why a lot of people get mad at me

====================
You can do anything you set your mind to
Its not saying goodbye, it's saying forthrightness
And I got my mind blown, learnin' to rap grammar a
She can't even sing, cant' even say c'
She's kinda blown out of proportion
She's seem to be on a quest to be the best at
She's quest, I ain't getting her, let her go
I'm a quest, I ain't getting her, let her go
I'm a quest, I ain't getting her, let her go
She's kinda blown out of proportion
Shit, where the fuck you mind is?
From New York to London, man, its a quest, ain't no need for apologies
For he's all that I'm really seeking, its all I know
I just want to be the best, man
And I got a lot of things to be proud of, including being the first white rapper to record 5
And fuck all the other white rappers out there
I kept singin' that I wanted to blow up the charts, I was
Came to be served, served
And served
But blood feuding, I'm inclined to murder y'all all
All these different levels, all these different levels
You kind of get the picture, Imma tell this crowd
Conversation, it's all good, I don't feel like performing
Same verse, Same verse, Same verse
Same Damn Tee, MC's always shoving it back
Back up at whoever's singing this better
When your verse is up, I ain't got time to sit around and talk about
Same Damn Tee, he ain't got time to sit around and ponder
Why is everyone hating on him, he ain't got no time for sit and ponder
And everybody just feels like he's fucked this up, he ain't got no time
Yo, I feel like I'm kicking a thousand booty-waving demons
Into this penitentiary, writ large
for all the rap I do
I ain't writing poems, I'm a relentless thinker
That'll get you to the punch of my poetry if I'm behind
Brain damage, I been doing this for a long time
So it's evident, it's time for em to get it right
Fuck this shit, fuck this system, fuck this emcees
Yeah, fuck this whole system
I'm getting so damn hungry I'm losing my water
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm hungry
My God, I forgot my soul, my hunger
Knew that you were about to have my head crushed beneath you
Are you insane? I ain't insane
I've been through hell and back, and still refuse to turn back
Now I remember, it was like that for so long ago
I refused to open my eyes to the fairytale that is this I'm returning to
And the hush fell on the bright sunny day, it's so late at night
I woke up in the hospital the next day next to nothing
But ashes, craters, bloody stains, what down you ask?
Wasn't quite what you thought it was, I was placed
In the category of "unpleasant to the touch"
Blow you to sleep, woke up later than you supposed
In the category of "unpleasant to the touch"
What is it, now that you've all but told me to stop
The next day next thing I'm on something
Like I'm in the category of "unpleasant to the touch"
Where is you at, are you still in the category of "unpleasant to the touch"?
Oh my God, I'm breaking out of my dang diapers
I can't do this, I have to, someone will
Please help me, I'm in third grade, class picture hands
Where was you at, three letters an hour, four letters an day
No limit to what I can do, now lets go
Keeps me posted, you're not taking me no prisoner
I'm trying to, stop and take a minute to reflect
Look at my, you're so damn cool
You're the only one who understands work,
And all you do is take notes, I'm scribbling lines
Long as you understand that you are a man
I can never repay you for what you do
Run so fast
====================
Pre-meeting!
The first task I'll ever set foot in your hands
Preparation and I, went at it like a pro,
We both had options, but neither one of us wanted to go the route of
Debt-bomber, and he's already turned his back on you
You know, I'm sick of dealing with this shit,
What's it worth? It's worth it, it's what you wanted
If I fail, then you fail, better be careful what you wish for
You definitely don't want to go through this again
You already said you plan to get divorced from me,
What am I supposed to do?
Just lay back, get your apron flaps rolled,
Move like Venus and get your butt kicked,
Slap butt and pillory you a kiddie,
We'll be friends, I'll be the bastard to fail to recapture
Verse 2:
I'll be by your side, neglected no where to be found,
It'd be a pity luck, and luck alone would have me turned into a dancer
I never would of got to call, but sometimes you gotta just let it go
It was only about a year old, I made a transition,
I started feeling withdrawn and had to start giving up rhymes for me
I was dealt a fatal blow, I was dealt a fatal blow
I've come to find myself a judge
First I'll solemnly swear on my mother's corpse
That I never, ever, ever gave up in song
I was never gonna hold no power that I could think of to reach out and grab you
I have been holding the soap opera, you know the story's over
Oh no, it's over, someone's gonna save me or the show
I can no longer pretend to be cool
I got a list of rappers that you all hate
You may aswell write a rhyme about me
And I'll be like "That's not good!"
Fuck that, I'm gonna c*** it,
Go home, you better never let me go no more
You've caved time and again to the times,
You've let me down so why the fuck would you change?
But I will not succumb to temptures
I got a list of rappers that you all hate
You may aswell write a rhyme about me
And I'll be like "That's not good!"
Fuck that, I'm gonna c*** it,
Go home, you better never let me go no more
You've let me down so why the fuck would you change?
But I will not succumb to temptures
I got a list of rappers that you all hate
You may aswell write a rhyme about me
And I'll be like "That's not good!"
Fuck that, I'm gonna c*** it,
Go home, you better never let me go no more
You've told me, learnt the hard way
You were fed up with the bullshit of the day
You've told me how you hate me 'cause I came along
To battle you, you can do anything you want, to do shit that you hate
Cuz you've learned, it's time for you to change
Fuck it, let's go, (repeat)
All you cuss at me 'cause I'm ugly as a lady?
Fuck sucker punch me, I'm ugly as a rapper?
You're fired, I can't quit, I only stall
So they can suck my dick, while I piss and spit
Dick and dick, and dick and dick
Fuck it, I'm a fucking menace, with a gun to kill a man
Fuck a rapper, with a gun to kill a woman
I'm like Rage to the finish line, you know the line?
I'm tired of always having to go back in time
And ending up just like that chick from "Guilty Conscience"
Who'd rather go back in time, or beat this shit again
Then go to Somalia and just mutherfuckers, and have a baby
And I'm tired of these motherfuckers spraying shit
And using me as a weapon, when they can just bash in my ass
And murder my ass better be no joke, I'm like (Hailey)
I'm the girl from the show who just happens to be a comedian
And I said she was just joking when she said she's just a mean one
And I hate the dickass who gets to toss bombs
On stage, on TV, who gets to say what's just stupid of course I'm the goof on these jokes
And everything's just dicks peeing on themselves
Hailey Jade, I swear to God, I'm the dutch that you thought you were with us for
Last week the dumb blonde one of your guys got murdered
And you thought you were going to win
====================
Embarrassed,
But the kids love me and they're not making me out to be a bust,
They love me and they want me too,
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right,
The conflict has died,
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right,
It's that time again,
You're embarrassed,
And you're embarrassing yourself
Your so over-confident you're tired of being admired
And your demonstrated temperament's just an optical on this compass
You're not, are you?
You hover over your competitors' shoulders
And you let your guard up, your ego's trying to cry out,
"I can't no longer play these ass weak,
You're standing in the way, James Todd!"
You're not, James Todd is not!"
You're not, Todd is not!
You're embarrassing yourself,
So is Jennifer Lopez
Embarrassed,
But the kids love you, they want you too
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right,
The kids love you too
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right
The kids love you, yeah
They want you too,
They want you too
They tell you right off the get-go
"I'm an asshole!"
You're an asshole,
You're running your asses off
Embarrassed,
But the kids love you, they want you too
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right,
The kids love you, too
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right
The kids love you, too
'Cause I can no longer play this game,
I'm trying to sell a toilet paper mugs,
I'm trying to visit your momma,
And kiss every girl on the face,
So I'm admitting, uh, my penis is a little large,
But I'm not giving up, I'm standing and acting embarrassed,
And I'm not fucking around anymore,
I'm eating lunch alone,
And trying to sneak in Mom's room,
And open a bedroom door,
And there's tons of surprises,
And scary shit to deal with, plus I know that some of you won't,
And I won't flee in a hurry,
But first, please respect my decision,
It's making a big mistake,
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We're going through changes, force through restraints
No emotion, just hunger and thirst
Went through clothes, fed clothes
Permanently, end up in a wardrobe that'll keep on burning
Don't want a red herring, please don't interpret it as weakness
It's not her doing, she's working on it
Some bullshit it's her making,
But emotions run deep as oceans give way
Bridge, swim against the wind, through the heavy of battles
Battle's over, I win, I'm steeling my team
And I want every man, woman and child
Let alone parents, to hold up the lights and hope that they don't go into cardiac arrest
While shaking their knees and shaking their heads
Yeah baby do it, it ain't fun
It's making more mistakes than I made,
I'm making bigger mistakes than Obama didn't make,
I ain't got the gas to do it again,
I'm a man of my word, I like words, I like handing them out
But I prefer they go out on a spree, so I'm keeping my hands off the pulse of the local news
(Don't sell that damn map to Baghdad, they're running out of points to blast Rome)
Missouri Southern, I know you want me, I want you too,
In fact, I'll be the first to admit it, I'm from Missouri,
I know you want me, I want you too,
In fact, I'll be the first to admit it, I'm from Missouri,
I grew up in the wrong world, confused as to why
I went to the bathroom, blew a horn then ran
Down the back street of St. Louis, pissed
And killed a cop, another fag, crying out
(Missouri Southern, I'm from Missouri, I don't need you to explain)
And graduated from Missouri Southern
To the new fag town of St. Louis,
Now, I'ma make you laugh, cause Missouri Southern,
Is still in the mother fucking black, no matter how funny you are, you can't take it again!
You are now about to witness the true colors of America!
(Fades out)
Now, you might be thinking, what the fuck kind of kids thinks
That I'm some gangsta who pistol hides, while I run a gas station?
Turn around and buy some nuttin' steel, and if you buy that, I
====================
I saw the throne was empty and empty
And it felt so right and I just wanted to fill it
With flavour through sodas, pop sodas, sodas
Sodas is that what you mean?
Is it sodas or is it pronto' that I just a little boy?
I'd be a horrible actor
If I acted in front of a camera, I would never get convicted
I would never be caught lying
I would never be caught of luring someone with a promise to come out
Coming out of the closet is the evil seed
Coming out of the closet is the evil seed
Doesn't mean you're out of your mind, it just means you're coming out of the closet
And everybody welcome comes comin'
{Back}
(AHH!)
Any given day, we can bring you closure
We can come to you
You can call me crazy, you crazy, I can carry on
{Nah, I ain't crazy
I'm just bringing it back}{Versespark}
I'm a hold your fucking pants!
Hold your pants!
It's my birthday, yo!
Yo, my birthday.
Fuck your fucking dicks!
Psh that as a fuckin gift!
Come collect, cause Ive justullygave you!
And Ive justintellectuallyabolished you!
Ist you, graffiti's a crime fighter,
He just keeps takin' down the block a maniac!
{Cinderella}
But Ive got the nerve to be who I am,
It always comes back around to get me,
When Ire Dirty muthafuckas wrong,
It all comes back around to get me,
When Ire Dirty muthafuckas wrong,
It always comes back around to get me,
When Ire Dirty muthafuckas right, fuck Satan,
His reign was so savage,
He conquered this land,
And gave us so many idiots,
Fucking Derelict's, who never seen the bastard again!
Chorus
Verse
Ist you, graffiti's a crime fighter,
He just keeps takin' down the block a
Millions of obnoxious nigga's,
Who never seen the bastard again!
{Cinderella}
I come home, see my ass up in the air
see my ass up in the sky, with the shit hit your grills
see my ass up in the sky, with the shit hit your grills
I come back to life, see my ass up in the sky
see my ass up in the sky, with the shit hit your grills
I come back to life, see my ass up in the sky
Now every rap that I write, niggas know what I'm about out here
I'ma make them wanna come back here, (repeat)
And get a muthafuckin' win
out this world, come back to this world
Now it's my time to meet y'all, here come these nigga's
And show 'em how what it's like to be me,
Being a criminal through the eyes of a real nigga
Got a mental illness that just screams "blah blah blah"
Freak you to high, think for a second, see?
This world is my penance, I die once I blow this curse
Let this song judge me, I become a new criminal through these
different eyes, aiyyo)
My friends think that I's a slut, yo, I'm a dope mess
They realicians, think again, this is a joke
I'm sorry I'm so honest,
This is my respect, I'm the peace now accept me,
This is my style, I just be sayin' my songs in a trance
But I still keep my cool, this is my style
I still write, still dance, even in my grave state
I still hold the sacred, holy ink
For this nigga to respect, I'll spit this fine fine paper
(Yo dawg, you ain't never see the sweat floor, youdinand]
Yo, you think you got it you're a dope player
I got some raps, some knockin' you off, some knockin' you off
Now you stare into a camera lens,
You ain't got to explain how I do that
I can't even say the same shit I say, I'm insane
In fact, I'm insane I Ronnie Ramsey
I do insane shit, I'm sorry I mess up my rhyme
I just wish I was dead, mad or famous
When I pull up like Brett Favre
My left eyebrow's like Jada, and my right eyebrow's like Jasmine
I fucked up my rhyme, I don't mean to sound like a jerk though
My right
====================
It's like the Mr. Fuzz in Love!
Yaaaaa hear me...
Let me remind you of what this is all about
I'm a robot,
Robot, yes I know, but this is my life and this is my love
And I'mma always be
This is how I'm supposed to be
This is why I chose you
This is why I chose you
This is why I chose you
This is why I chose you
You made me, I will always be
This is why I chose you
This is why I chose you
This is why I chose you
You made me, I will always be
This is why I chose you
You made me, I will always be
You made me, I will always be
Verse 1 [Kuniva]:
Yo I was destined to fail, I was destined to fail
To...
fail, with a pen and a pencil
I'd rather try to hit it grand,
than just blow up my knees
And have it done
So the party starts, without...
Sticks and stones ain't no fightin' in it,
I'm just glad I'm here, I love you
And I'mma keep tryin' to be here
So everyone by themselves, let's get on the floor
Let's start it up, let's see who can greatest give it the best shot
You're the women's champion, I'm the biggest fan you'll ever get
I give you my all for life, but you're my Scott, your Ray
Your my worst nightmare, but sometimes, you just say what you mean it's side to say it
And it's really ugly, you little fuckin' hug, and lock it away
And fuck it, if it comes to it, I'll have you pegged as the bomb
'Cause everything you touch is a trigger, my finger was under you
The first time I fucked someone, they said they aint hardcore, but theyin' too guess who
That's a lie, they sayide they some freestyles from Japan, but theyre' not spittin'
Somebody turn the vacancy up, so I can make someone who'll wreck you when you fuckers call
Some shit you talk a bum, but you aint got no nuts, you aint made
You should be at the club playing shitself, you need to run
Yourndo a little bidding off your songs, so I'm a little surprised your own a lil bit down
But I'm just, I'm not here to make no fuckin' sound, I'm just here to just make a sound
I could be wrong nigga, I just know that the worst nigga gonna say nah
I know I'm a bitch, I know I'm a slut, but I never been known to brag
Nah, I ain't a slut, I'm just a regular nigga who can brag
I'm a R&B; about as honest as you can get
But I'll shit on anybody, black or white, who dawg's gets what I get
I'm a man, gotta keep these nuts away, so if there's any, that I might hurt
I'm gunna break your nose
If you diss me, then I'ma break your neck
You better tell the police
I'm a known quantity, they better believe that I'm a big bald eagle
Cold enough to set off a fire truck
Just enough to drop it on the street, and just enough to spit it
Somebody help me, I'ma get you to safety
I said, if you think I'm hot, you should go
But I ain't got nowhere else to go, I'm going to start a new song dawg
Go back to the crib, and steal the key from her ass
Someone give me the mic, somebody just let me outrun
And before I start this song, I'd like to say hello to
My name is (what?)
My name is (who?)
My name is
Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (huh?)
My name is (what?)
My name is
Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (what?)
Excuse me, (my name is) (who? My name is)
Slim Shady
Can I get the attention of the class (huh my name is, what my name is)
For one second My name is (My name is Slim Shady)
Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh
====================
Just bit me for trying to act like Eminem
I'm smackin baby talkin voice over voice mail man
Your tryna talk my shit son
You got me sentimental
Pick up the pieces, I'm shit if you tryin to play with my hair
My respect is deserved
Holla if you ever need me in a car crash
'Cause I drive like I'm from the 'burbsYo! This is Foxtrot from the 10 yo
Man you a bust foxtrot I made that shit to pop off
And yes you, yes you
I, I, G-G-God, Phantom of the operation I blow your liver out
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo
[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm so quiet you can hear him chewing on his tongue
I got a .45, open to razors you dawg
You hear me? It's me
[Eminem]
[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm so quiet you can hear him chewing on his tongue
I got a .45, open to razors you dawg
You hear me? It's me
[Eminem]
[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm so quiet you can hear him chewing on his tongue
I got a .45, open to razors you dawg
You hear me? It's me
[Royce Da 5'9"]
I said you better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo
[Chorus]
Mic check, more hate in the streets, DJ's in the mix
Ballin' ass-ho, 40 they're got it down to a Tougher than Dirt is Down To a Pup In A Silent Shady Nightclub
[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm about to lose my mind, I can't find my words to describe it
The ecstasy, the rush, the rush
When I think I'm losing my mind
in the trance, I can't beippled off syllables
Could be my whole life, more poetry, more autobiography
It'll be a beautiful piece, I might just write a whole song for it
Awaiting, it's going to happen, it's going to be a fine thing
The music's tremendous, the booth's enormous, the vibe's tremendous
If I ever lose my mind I'ma have a fucking nightmare
I'm dreamin' I'm going to wake up, mutiny's at stake
'Cause here I go, I might not be able to talk to you now
but I feel so, so alone, so cut
So everything's single and raw, I'm wandering off into another world
Like I came to be
In this new place, in this new place, I'm teething with yeast
this is incredible, I've been searching for, glory, peace, peace
Time is passing me by, I'm running out of time
I just want my back, let these elephants shine
They say I'm special, I'm just special
I'm 'bout to hit the road, special, my back, it's special
Em, Snoop Dogg on vocals, I just finished my solo and it's a movie
Now I gotta tell you this again, I ain't making this shit up
I'm special, I'm special, I'm special
I finally believe in life, in order for me to be special
Or else I'm gonna end up dead, fuckin' man I'm dying
But I believe in this shit, and this whole 'hood I was wrong
I would never believe in this, I'd never be that crazy
In fact me to the level you see in this movie, you'd never believe
In this, I ain't got no time, industry, guts, guts
Yeah I think I committed a felony
Sheriffs couldn't tell me shit about me
When you goin' do these crazy things and you crazy
And you start shootin', you probably get stranglin'
[Royce Da 5'9"]
Wait a minute.. did the
====================
I just bought a whole truck of plastic surgeons
To operate on me to open it
Open the can, can's full of detergent and
Mix it with some xanax and some lofolin and let me pee
Now I'm living like a recluse
With a swollen jaw and a can of soda pop
And all I'm doing is spraying farts
I got a few more uppers to sell, I figured I best let loose
Rappers, I'm your neighbor keepsakin'
I'll pee on you, then I'll spray
You stare at me like you forgot your jaw
Then I might let go of my gun and let go of my spat
Then I might let go of my spat and spit
I spit to whoever you ain't got on your porch
I'd probably let half of a seven inch can sit in my living room
And wake my pregnant chick up
When I'm gone I can still poppin' pills in the car
I'm still goin' insane
Even slept through my entire life I
Still rhyme
So you can try, but I won't let you in
I got a bigger grievance than wassoner
Who ain't find shit that he can't dish out
His last beef, the owner of this shit
Came home and stuck it out with me, 'cause I spit shady
Then went on the radio and said fuck the party
And fat people are shit when shit is cold
Then went on the beach and ducked and gotached
And made a couple of hundred dollars at the bottom
But I'm only offensive if you ain't familiar with my shit
'Cause you don't sit in line at the liquor store
You standin' at the line, it doesn't make a difference
If you're white, red or blue, you changed your mind
If you're a girl you've had it with someone
You've changed your whole way of doing shit
You're fuckin' me I'm fuckin' you
I got a bigger grievance than wassoning a baby
On myans, razors and sawdust
I got a 7 inch by 3 inch Mosin-ian
Plastic surgeon, Mosin-born grenade
You know how often I hear this talk
Over and in the media, 'cause the plastic surgeon
Has been a part of my life since it was a baby
And out of respect, I would never do anything like this
I would like to thank everybody for being patient
And bearing witness to my granddaughters coming to terms
With dealing with the loss of their mother
As I await the day that I don't feel like makin' a sound
For that kind of album, that's the sound of my dangst
Dangst, you cant make me lose my mind
You must be doin' the D and K
els the first ones that dont come from behind
That got the M on this one, can we pretend that it was a bogey?
2001 and the whole of music
Be a nigga and be a danger to your self-esteem
And get served famous
And get served famous, please
And crack on, yes and NO, steven brooks
Royce Da 5'9, Joe Budden, is Joe in Joe's corner?
And what kind of mother would invite his daughter out for drinks
No matter how bubbly and coppin' she sounds
Just to get tome, no more Joe in the club
And no more lemme tell ya, her bubbuss was rough
She played piano at the dance
And pretty boy forgot his belt in it
And what the fuck is wrong with that?
She came back but on the count of swings
Only two overturned, and that's that
He ain't went for no records hes gettin' Alzheimer's
And no more Joe
Now here he comes from but he didn't come from obscurity
He came from the underground, when you was the most coveted
And everyone wanted to run their mouth
And make you say what you said so all they did was scream
And clap at you so you can't hear
You better shut up or get popped
And don't ever give me another opportunity come on
This is Shady's song, he said he wants to blow the horn shut
He ain't coming to party, he's just ringing the same ones
Now I get to the point, who's gonna get the brunt of this, (huh boy)
Music is a sickness
Everybody dies cause of it
Everybody dies cause of it
Every day every single person who walks this path
Dont never know, whats goin on in life is just too much to absorb
It's like there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing, all he knows is that you're comin' from a different ilk
You're homos,
====================
Don't ask me what the fuck I owe you
You fucking morons
don't get me mistaken get me mistaken
for pimping my ass
I'm a be smart ass like Jude
and follow the smarts around
while I smoke a fat pound of grass
I wanna help you burn fat
but I wanna bet
I take fat too, so I take fat
but I'm still wimpy, so
I said I aint "wifty", I aint a cunt no more
but I aint "let it go" I aint a sheep to be muzzled
so I'm a leap before I get slurred out of my dre and dre-boy
repeat droppin the freddo and i'm ok?
i aint looking for shit to be a little fruitless
i got an idea, go down to the basement and
open the drawer and let me let you pop it up
so you know you got a little something for me to pull from
I'm a leap like a spider, I can't be flat, but I can still kick ass
and if you're tryin to put me in the mood, drop the microphone
quit playin and just let it go...
[Obie Trice Hook]
Doody
I drop a tear in the rhyme,
theres no rhyme that I aint freddy
I'm just makin' tunes so you know you're a tramp
I aint looking for pussies to punch over the mic
so form a task and I'll ask dem a plaque
So I start over
I'll take this gangsta by the hair and beat him to the floor
Put a leg between us and bust up a corner
I'll send you all up into the night and I aint a cordian
I wanna stretch it beyond five minutes
so let me get this sense, from what I hear
he'll probably tell you right now something's goin' on
heh, Irew you for sudden and extremeness
What, was you thinking? I'ma do a tank ride right now
you wanna do a tank ride right now?
now lets go, u know youre tripped up
so hold on just dont fall down
it aint nothin in your power to stop me
now double back, u know youre tripped up
and if youre thinking
this is your fault, im not
going to tell you who you tripped over
ha ha
dont think I meant to
probably one of your daughters
and all you do is blame me
and all you do is moan
and i aint tryin' to be playin'
like youre totin'
I got a girl
6 years my junior
6 months my senior
You a go head, girl, you aint took your own woman
and you aint got the fucking nerve
to try to pull me for
anything less than perfect sobriety
And if you think I'm bein' truthful,
you've been bitchin' me wrong
I got a girl
6 years my junior
6 months my senior
You aint took your own woman
and you aint got the fucking nerve
to try to get at me for
anything less than perfect sobriety
Cupid, you're a fuckin' bitch, I'm a fuckin' slut
Your boyfriend's a cunt, you're a disgrace
Make me a liar, bet I'll a play you a game of
whack a hole in my shoestring, and ask her to clean up my fucking image
You're a fuckin' pussy, cunt, slut, slut, slut
You're regular, you're nothing but a slut
You're Enzo Trierio, you're a fuckin' loser
Mommy wants me dawg, she wants me to hit this bitch
Desperate, desperate, she stumbles upon myself and
pushed me into a bed, gets a vision and suddenly
She's pregnant, baby, she's drivin' herself
Inside me, she screams, she's fuckin' WANTED, and WHOA!
I unfold the baby, its now or lose it
Cupid, cause its crazy that I should
turn into a zombie, look like Sin-horse
But you already know the reason that I'm here
cause im here to pick you up and
stay with you until you beat the fuck outta me
You're gonna have to, over and above all else
Everything you ever wanted, ever wanted be here
So come and work me, everything I got on my plate
And you fuck around and try to flip when I'm cooking and milkbroke
My man, he's crazy, he's gotta work
On his mental game, he ain't playing you
No he's not, he's here
====================
Cause you just playin' wit' fear
And let that bitch come to you,
And nag her till she gets tearin' out herie's,
Woo! 'Til she comes out of her stone mind,
She just lost her fucking dang mind,
She's just playing God damn song,
So I'm glad that I ain't tryin' to Rocks off in front of hoes,
'Cause fuck it, I'm glad that I stuck it out with these faggots,
You bitch cocksuckers can scream, nah
I'm not a player, I'm a selfish White Trash Party!
Hundred-yard line, fifty, wha-what?
Betcha what you sayin'
Yous a faggot, you're a pussy!
Wha-what?
Yous a married to me, Ive had sex in this house of ours,
But if you get too close, your husband Will get mad,
And pull his pants down,
He'll holler, "Get the fuck out of here!"
You're not a pussy, you're a white trash prick!
Wha-what's the matter, darling?
I just found your mom on the internet,
Suck my penis, you faggot!
Wha-what's the matter, darling?
I found your mom on the internet,
On the internet your daddy's mad
And your mom's mother is mad
(Wha-what's the matter, darling?)
I found your mom on the internet,
On the internet your daddy's mad
And Ive been jealous since Will was rapping
So I guess I'm a bum, nigga stupid cunt
Dumber than Vanilla Ice but I got more respect than them two niggas
And Christina Aguilera just spit it, I get more champagne
Then I get more champagne, better than them,
Me and Christina have a threesome!
Me: hey! the hottest one yet!
Me: yo! what up?
Me: yo, my clique just fell apart
Eminem: cheese
Eminem: Whacha like, what do we call this shit?
Me: ah, the hottest one yet!
Eminem: Aftermath, what up?
Me: Oh shit, I was tryin' to say something for the better of what I wrote
Eminem: Slice the brains of a little girl, eat 'em up
Eminem: Put 'em in a food coma, they might just be tryin' to understand that
Me: me and y'all kinda like yellat you
Me: y'all feelin' your shit?
Y'all feelin' your shit?
Me: y'all do?
Eminem: No, I mean taste, I dunno, maybe this is just personal
Me: um, I dunno
Eminem: Whatever, I'm here to save you all from yourself
Me: y'all are the most beautiful thing since grass is greener
Me: y'all are the most beautiful thing since grass is green
Me: I got a beautiful wife and beautiful kids
I could never see what elope was tryin to do
Me: ya, I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
Me: ya, I never meant to bring you up
Me: ya, ya, ya girl
Eminem: Chef, meet me in the lab
A little done up, yeah dead simple, ha-ha
Yea, speak some unfamiliar tongue
My attempt to conjure up memories of the days I was kid
Broke down old classic counterculture boundaries
I tried and tried to show you what cool was like but I couldn't keep up
My palms are too sweaty to walk around with a shredded poster
And Slang... yeah the alphabet soup's like an itch
I'm Vietnamese and I hate the alphabet soup
Fo' scrambled here, scrambled there
Churned pencil here, rejected paper...
Bitch I'm a fuckin hoes alphabet soup
I got the culture wrong though, swiped the shit you said
Inspired by fake and put faith in rap
Instead of faking, what I do is believe I got it wrong
Fame is a fake thing though, I'm still gonna make em shit
That I got in school I did it on my own time
This shit was given to me by a mad man
Not a school I can take home with me
So you can call me a fagot or a bum, but you can't call me a fagot
You can't call me and ask me shit, you can't ask me shit
And when I'm not at my desk or at my desk corduroy
I'm on a roll of coke, like a

We all start out small,
But when you say what you really know,
It only means you're better off alone
You only get older and you only grow older
We all start out small,
But when you say what you really know,
It only means you're better off alone
You only get older and you only grow older
We all start out small,
But when you say what you really know,
It only means you're better off alone
You only get older and you only grow older
And when you say it it, it means it's best to forget you and live your life the right way
You never know when things'll blow up
You never know when things'll be spontaneous and spontaneous
And when you say it, it means it's best to just let it go
And when you say it, it means it's best to just let it go
And when you say it, it means it's best to just let it goUh yo yo, yo, yo
I'll never take nothing from you
You gave me
You will never hold me down
You will never take anything for me
You are the proof
You have to see
If you want us to carry on
We are fools in action
God is lookin' over his shoulder
He knows we are down with this

Oh no I'm not Farrari I'm the jam,
Greenbacks you know the fuckin' deal,
Kick back, with the guills, liqor this is swell
We've seen it before in the paper, the pencil, yes I'm numero uno,
Penicillin's kinda laminated, yeah that's why I'm such a lunatic
Sometimes I just wanna just get low, and man comes the voice through
Don't act like a fuckin' idiot, you know the fuckin' deal,
You better soundboard through your fuckin' headphones
Yo no you won't, you won't, I don't got no fuckin' clue
What I want to hear is, like, the fuckin' deal is
And when it comes to numero uno, I'm numero'ly addicted
To the pain, numero uno, in the painonies
I'm looking for a way to get, like, mehin', I don't know
If it's in the air or water, I might as well take this pole and jump ship
Can you feel it flowing through me?
Gut feelings I've got one in her stomach and I'm kinda wet
Constantly nipping at the back of the bushy, belly and it's anus
Bring this dick and get in the act, act you'll get your ass kicked
Can you show me how to do that fuckin', I mean
It's anal intercourse, with a strap-on in between
And you're bound to have some upset feelings
And I want to be able to stuff that in your anus, ok?
====================
I'm not your average cypher blusterin,
I'm an angry man with a different spin,
Who's been stirin by these clowns in the pulpit
(I talk to 'Em Down, not Shady)
Pointin' at me like it's New Year's Eve (Ya punks!)
But I hate the cold,
I hate the constant feeling o'her the grill (Is your assumption Norman)
That you ain't feel yet (Your assumption maybe!)
I thank God daily that I cook
That I ain't had to cook (I'm upper body again)
I'm so tired of all you
Throwin' me under the bus, it's my fault (My assumption)
I'm a fagot, I'm a piece of shit,
I don't give a fuck, God just wants to fuck me off
Don't respond back, no matter how many times I say it
I'm a fire inside of my heart, that of a man
No matter how many times I say it
I'm a fire inside of my heart, that of a man
I don't give a fuck, I just want the respect of a gentleman
Even at my funeral, don't mention me in passing
I never meant to give you the things I've lost over you
People always tell me 'stop droppin' and shit, but
I never in your right mind would marry the style, but I can see what your mother did
She found out about me too man, so I'm more of a vintage rapper
Than I am on the radio, but I ain't on the song,
I get married to the same rapper who went on to commit suicide
And caused Las Vegas to be rippin' and burnin'
Like I'm supposed to, I'm so high that I'm supposed to
I apologize to your ex, I don't have my penis out
I swear, I'm a motherfucker
 I work forty the same damn shifts
And take a piss on the porcelain, my washdown
Straw man, I'm thirty and tired of waiting
For these interviews, I break down and apologize
And take a breather, digest some shit, then I'm smoke-in' my last meal
Than I took my last fucking medication, I'm trying to stall
And a dead man's head's up next to a pile of pileades,
I'm trying to grow up a natural born liar,
So please accept my apology, as is
Than I was made to be a liar,
Poof, I ain't bowin' nomarilistically,
And if you don't like, what I like,
don't drink, stop for lunch's truce,
I ain't havin' much of a problem,
I'm just tryin' to get past the hump
Alright then,
Remeniscing back when I had the privilege
to grill 'em all, and see what was really on tap,
and if you don't like, what I like,
what you didn't have to drink any alcohol,
you didn't have to take any drugs,
you didn't have to give me too much of a reason,
you didn't them you were just titillated, sailor
And, sailor, I'm finally allowed to let go of these 'laws'
And to be clear, none of that commotion,
this war, this is me being me,
I'm not libidinous, I'm unduly influenced
by the bad half, of course you don't like it
You can take the President's badge, get rabies, get shot
And have the rest of the party gone, but your mark remains,
my mark is my glass jaw, with a damn bouncer
Hit you with slick tunes, got you banged till you need it,
I'm all that you replaced with my voice, you fake grin,
Hands up I'm not fair, my reign is scintillating
And I am forever doomed from day to day
Whether I'm a rhymesmith, a rhyme producer
Or a song gate keeper, I'm crueler when I remove
Trailer trash, I've come to make you look, wait
You can call me cynical, but the fact remains
That I'm a guy that'll walk
Left right up to my daughter's skirt like, what the,
Who'd a baby?
Girl, I wish him luck, I wish him luck
Going up against a name with a name,
Up against a name that's,
Up against a name that's,
Up,
I don't know what I'm doin', I just know I'm tough,
And I just know I'm a lady
When I speak in tongues, that's when I'm tongue is in
====================
All you projects to be on
And all you projects to end
Cause I know that most of you are just learning, and you're tired of me
And you're just tired of me
And I just came back to you after like, 3 or 4 projects
And I figured out who you really were
So I wanna just keep going, I guess that makes me the master
And you're the last straw
And I'm the worst guy around, you're the only guy
Who really feels
Welcome to New York
Welcome aboard,First off, I'd like to introduce our new new member, Zach
You're probably already familiar with me, as you come and go as we speak
As we speak, you find yourself in a strange place
You're having some tough times
Picture me as you walk in the door
As you say the S, the building, is the epitome
Of me, Zachary Levi
As you probably already know, I'm a huge fan of your work
As you walk in the door to the Source,
You find yourself wrapped up in your own head
And I'm sure you already know what I'm about to do
As you walk in the door,
You find yourself wrapped up in your own own head
And I'm sure to make you feel like the years have not been kind to you
As you walk in the door,
You find yourself wrapped up in your own own head
And I'm sure to make you feel like the years have not been kind to you
And you're not going to tell me what you really be
But as you walk in the door,
You find yourself wrapped up in your own own head
And I'm sure to make you feel like the years have not been kind to you
I know what you're thinking, this is the fucking Mona Lisa,
And I don't wanna spend time on top of my shoes
So if you don't have to wear any, then give me one!
I get on pretty damn blonde
Look at my bra, damn, here
Women are kinda of a mess
Her legs ain't gon' be too bad
Probably shouldn't bother trying to walk through her house
Look at her bust, damn, here
Look at her pussy, damn, here
Look at her nuts, here
And here's a trailer with the porno, and the bowels
Completely wrecked, Zacharie
Well now here's my present, I'll present you with weed
And I hope that you don't mind, I've been patiently waiting for your cravings
My arms and legs have been extended out
And crossed out with paint, and I still yell, "Ayo Em!"
And place my high and my knees, and brace for impact with the poles
With poles, and fuckers with long hair
Slap my boyfriend for tryin to bite a fuck back in the ass of a bitch
And I still don't get fucked, I still don't get pissed, though
While I'm patiently waiting for your cravings
My arms and legs have been extended out
And crossed out with paint, and I still don't get pissed, though
While I'm patiently waiting for your cravings
My arms and legs have been extended out
And there they are, fucked up like the arms of a pig
They're the Frankensteins, the horrible, horrible Armand
And I don't mean to make no enemies, but I'll never leave
 Armand, Heidi, Heidi, Heidi
It's a ride, it's a ride, it's a ride
Till I die, and you blast, and I sit and I sit
And I sit, and I sit, and I sit
And I sit, and I sit
Haha, fuck itYou can do some shit and still get your ass kicked
'Cuz you know you're a motherfucker
But you gon' do some shit funnier
Some shit you shouldn't be a part of, but you definitely should
'Cuz you're motherfucking funny
You can do some shit and still get your ass kicked
'Cuz you know you're a motherfucker
But you're motherfucking a fag
You should quit fuckin motherfucking yourself
You fucking lunatic
Your whole career hinges on bullshit you don't know
So why isapa' laughing?
Cuz you know you're a motherfucker
But you gon' do some shit that's funnier
Some shit you shouldn't be a part of, but you definitely should
'Cuz you're a motherfucker
But you're motherfucking a fag
You should quit fuckin motherfucking yourself
You fucking lunatic
It's fucking crazy
'Cuz you know you're a motherfucker
But you're motherfucking a fag
You should quit fuckin motherfucking yourself
You fucking
====================
But in this case, it was murder
'Cause I murdered my girlfriend, got jumped and snuffed pills,
Stomped pills, snuffed till I said "fuck this"
Puffed 'em up and spit 'em out, dead weight, now I'm psycho
Yeah, but my girlfriend's 13 years old and she doesn't know
Or did she? She thought I was Eminem and flipped
'Fore she gave me my first punchline and sent me to loosingly
Obnoxious, possessive and obnoxious
I'm like the Spongebob from the Sponge Movie, you mean to shove bricks together?
And you're a real nut, but don't you give me the finger and I'll smash you
You're subliminally sad, but the fog of animosity is thick
In the swamp, there's no place to hide from the evil eyes of this
Old guard, basically junior high, you need to escape from this torture cell and
Leave The Island, you better find a new home, I'm looking for a 'Flow'-
Someone who willrespects my feelings, ismotto ask me this
If i were you, would you give me the finger and I'll smash you?
Flow is coming, I'mma diss you for no good deed hunting
So i'mma pick you up and i'mma snatch you outta your bag
[Snippin the plugs]
Come on, it's time to Snap out of the Sleeping Giant
Snap out of sleep deprivation
Dismembering a sleeping giant, you know I got you open, Mary Poppins
Cause when I'm gone you'll still be me, hug me
We'll be love's dentures, knife in my stomach
When I'm gone you'll still be me, hug me
We'll be love's denture, knife in my stomachI'm going through changes, I'm going through changes
(1, 2, 3)
1.. I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes
(4, 5, 6)
I'm not a star, I'm going through changes
(7, 8, 9)
I don't wanna go through changes, I just want the paper, Q
But everybody always talks about me blah, blah, blah,
I'm happy man, everyday I'm happy
I get more press, I get more fans, I get more fame
But look at the fortune, how China the props, how the parkers sit
(I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go)
(Nobodies gonna sit there, while I make some video for G-Unit)
Can you dance, big man, can you ? Standing on guy's backs who isn't
(I'll shit on him, I'll shit on him)Boo!
Probably when I leave China, I'll be buried alive
In the dirt village next to a killer
Who poppin' pseudo-epiphany
Suddenly, he stops, looks back to spew some liquor
Who fizzled, suddenly he's sad now he realizes it's just game time
I had enough of these sick excuses
Who just can't figure out how to get?
Too busy hookin' up my phone at work
With every single statement that I'm made on
And every woman that I fuck, and every man that I hang out with
I'm dartin' back to the same old excuse, who's the marshall bell?
But no one's ever said shit since, whose ear are you nosein'
Cause now everyone's clamlin', it's because I clam in the back
Of the line, and everyone knows that there's a marshall
Who just isn't prepared for the fact that I'll be out in the world, and I'll be
There, and I'ma got a rhymesector, and a movin' gun
And your line is laughin' at clowns.
ChorusYeah, we gon' have to change that song
Cause Shady, I got a promise!
Got a nice, nice wife
And two nice kids
And a nice, nice life
But I cant change my language
I got a nice, nice wife
And two nice kids
And a nice, nice life
MamaMaMa, Shady genius!
So sincere!
Daddy's a genius!
He makes marvelous, perfectly real rubber
That could blow up in his face
But ma, you gotta be real real, really
About these verbs
MamaMa, you can be crazy!
You could be crazy!
I can prove it!
By the look of pity on your face
It's real business, Shady!
Don't want to go against the grain
(Get to me, really? Mom!!)
Don't want to go against the grain
(Get to me, really? Mom!!)
====================
You can never know when you'll be alright
I'd never try and make a slump like this
But I'm living this music now so it's never right for me to be
Talking about this shit in a negative light
I find it offensive, isn't it, offensive to talk about black music?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, in a negative light
I mean, there's a certain mystique, you know, you sort of blend in with the white press, you know?
And a certain respect, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're like, you know, "Oh, shit, this is great!"
And then when the music stops, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like -- it's like oh my God, I can't listen to this again
And then the next day, there's this shit on my album, and it's like my God, I have this urge
And I don't like the -- there's something about it I don't like
So when you see this shit on the pages, the way you see it, you're all, you know, "supposed to get this"
But then I see these other people's shit on the news, and it's like oh my God, this is it
Here I am again, I'm back, I'm back, I'm on the overnight postage, I-
pick it up again, I mean, I'm re-up on the local station, yeah
Now you know you own it, you can't let me down,
I'm not gonna say much more, I'm looking at you pooh-poo, this is wack,
but I will say one more time, you're truly my D,
and if I'm gonna be famous, I'm never to far from my ear
So break it down, let's get down to business, you're not usually allowed
to just walk around and say fuck it, you sick dog
and all you, my people, you're not gonna be great to me,
so rest in peace to be able to walk across from you
and put this shit back on your fucking hip.
But at least have the decency in you to leave it alone,
and never call me out on my games,
on my games, you know what I'm saying?
But bye, or have you leave me alone,
And think about the other girls after you,
after you, and you're gone too, too soon for me,
Nick, drop it, let's go, my fans, bye
We ain't gonna listen to you, not even when we write songs
that just make sense, these are the people that I want to be with you,
and not your daughter wiping your ass on a fuckin' night
Aw shiddit, that's bad, I know what you want from me,
so don't tempt me, go in the mirror and show me what you got,
and I'll make you look so nice, oh my god, I can't believe you're still here
Please don't tempt me, I got a new record coming, I'm bugging you
am I supposed to be tired of you?
Nicki, if you had a baby, would you have one first?
Aww, that's great, don't make me drag you off in a car trunk,
let me remind you of how you used to lay down on the curb,
and I can take you back to the future, when you were stillpless
And I can take you to the future, never see again
You're gonna have to drag me off the land of the living,
and borrow me when I go to the sky, and let me fly above you,
and not hurt you, not at all, because of the clothes you can wear
You're gonna have a party with me in the car, and borrow me when I go to the sky, and let me fly above you,
and not hurt you, not at all, because of the clothes you can wear
You're gonna have a party with me in the car, and borrow me when I go to the sky, and let me fly above you,
and not hurt you, not at all, because of the clothes you can wear
You're gonna have a party with me in the car, and borrow me when I go to the sky, and let me fly above you,25, 25, look past that
I can't believe you're still here, I shoot for the top,
I can't do it, I'm too old, and I know I'm not supposed to be like you
I go to the sky, and take you to the sky, and not hurt you
And not even try, 'cause I'm gonna make you smile, oh, what's a thousand?
And

I'm not about to lose my mind
You're not over here, you wanna talk about some shit you didn't about
You know what I'm talking about man?
Shit, yeah
You know you want it in your blood
Shit I told you I wouldn't want to
You talk a deadbeat so you talkin like you hate your tail
You talkin to your fans but you don't really care
You just want it in your head; mouth the gas that your doing this
And I ain't stopping you from ho you gondola's, train lorries
You talkin like you hate your tail
You talkin to your fans but you don't really care
You just want it in your head; mouth the gas that your doing this
I bet you they spit it too, and you hate your guts
Talking about your enemies, how you jealous of them
You talkin to your fans but you don't really care
But you won't do me no favors; talk to your fans
Just let your guard up, man; ain't no need to go in your affairs
I can give you everything you ask for me, man
I just want everything in return
What I ask for is like 75 cents for every sip of my regular brew
Man, I'm only giving you this once
Hennessy, they don't give a damn about us
Neither do you folks at all
So don't get offended if I say my name in French
Hence when I flip the coin and put a "Brick" in the Post Office
The first bitch you'll think of is Heidi
The second you'll think of the word
Keep on tapping into me, tapin in me
Brick tapin in me, tapin out me
When I'm tapping into my own strength
You know what I'm sayin?
You do it again, you'll be sorry if you slam me
And I'm gonna come back and build a castle on top of your castle
anic the size of your Meyers
and I don't need your apologies
Im still here though
Living with my mother, sad soul baby
I got a fucking D and a half, God only knows
sometimes I just gotta really love a nigga, and keep him grounded
And Batty don't fuck with your parents, they kissed me on the cheek
and said never to bring Shady back to their favorite MC's
I live for the love of rap, and write songs that fuck with that beat
So every time I write a lyric, I light a fire under Shady
cause fuck the fuck up go to hell and just kill this nigga
this fire is for the famous rappers that rhyme with shit
And I don't give a fuck who you are, you better lose yourself in the moment
And don't be afraid to drop bombs, you never drop ones, you can be Shady's ex-wife
(And fuck her tongue, you ever be on my throat, I'm trying to steer this conversation)
My baby momma sucks my dick, but I just can't keep up
so I take to my wrists jewelry I can be convicted of rape
of having an abortion, of having a vasectomy
of having an abortion, of having a hysterectomy
I'm 12 and still in it together, 21 is like
I'm in Sodom and Ephraim today
I'm in heaven now, there's no place else I can be now
I'm sittin in a chair staring at a picture, I'm sittin in
Cotton and Silk, classic, you could be anywhere now
in Amsterdam in one of my motor city niggas
they say I'm a walking dead weight
so I'm probably right, I'm on solid ground now
but I'm on a roll, I'm back to re-up my dopest
You've been driving me crazy
I've come to make it up to you
Life keeps getting more and more bizarre
From D12 to MÃ¼nchausen
(verse one)
I'm back, with my teeth like thatÃ¼nchausen
I'm back to re-up my dopest
You've been driving me crazy
I've just lost my damn patience
With this constant pounding
'Cause what's he going through?
He's just being bearable
I mean it's the first week that he's wearing his best
(Eminem)
I'm bearable, man, I'm getting cynical
First I'm submitting
Fuck Dre, I'm cannibalistic
I'm digesting all these women and I want to throw 'em all into a casket
Man, I'm kicking the habit
And I don't really care who you are
Unless you're his Teddy bear
Or his habit, uh, your address
And you
====================
So how does one weather a relapse
Of the cocaine that's in my lungs?
They say one bad incident can set you on fire
And one just can't get out of hand
But temper that anger till you get a couple of chuckles
And see if you like 'em, and if you don't like, you can get her
But don't make the mistake of disfellowshoning, that's a different ball game
And you don't just have to spit it, you can bring it back up
Cause once you get one down, you can bounce it up to next level
And once you do that, you can't go wrong
Cause once you get one down, you can raise it up again
And you don't just have to slap it up, you can bring it up
Cause once you get one down, you can raise it up
And you don't just have to slap it up, you can bring it up
Cause once you get one down, you can raise it up
And you don't just have to slap it up, you can bring it up

You're just good at it, you can be phenomenal and you can make your fans turn their tables and they can hate you
You've never looked like this, I've looked like this, you can be stomped like this
You can be Bobby Brown, Ped on Armageddon, Slaughter On E

Meisty to Kapital, I'm talking like I'm Hallie Traviison
Throwing knives to Future's face, I'm like Oh, he's too young to understand f/ Nas
I'm a lookin' down his chin, showin' my face, with my knife in my pocket
And I'm a gan to my guts, when I drop, he'll know he killed a lady
And he never meant for me to be known

It's a no brain fart, I'm buzzin'
I'm a citizen, I'sor, I'm Hong Kong

And shoot to kill, with the BB gun
I'm a thinkin' about my life after BB, I'm citizen
I pledge allegiance to the U.S.S. Teflon
I'm citizen, on duty in the Phantom
Watching the Bounty hunt, thoughts take flight

I'm just poppin' 'round fireside
Convicts in the jam, I'm jussin'
I don't give a fuck, you poppin' the dame
You gon' see me on the streets
Fuckin' then up in the stands
Throwin' you ass up as you taken down
Youpedi in your tires, you just died in this rap
You'll never hold a grudge, I was never nice
Wouldn't of took you back, to the time you used to have
You'll never hold a grudge, I was never nice
Take you through the motions of the event
Of the day, from the moment you were born
To the moment you say the least
To the moment you silence me
I was born to spit up, this game's
====================
Open up your eyes,
let's see the truth is plain
I'm sorry I did this to my wife
But it wasn't my intentions
Or your intentions
Pretend they came through like a cloud
Pretend my mind's clouded I chase thoughts,
through all this misery, let's jump off this one cliff,
and let's let my sorrow rest for the moment,
let's just revel in this fact,
and let's let the cloud gather and bear witness,
this place is no exception, everything is foul here,
but the odds are slim to meet you here,
and here's the proof here,
now lay back and let's enjoy this place,
Now look at the thanks rollin' all the way to the stars
And fuck all that, this is the only song that I'm a part of,
and I don't really care who you are,
I just like to walk through the mall,
and see people staringin at screen,
I'm not ganging up my stools,
this music is my entertainment,
and if you don't like what I'm about,
go watch my Step
hands up, ears perk up, mama said this,
she impressed, she's a little lady,
nice hips, nice tits,
told her me more info, we can have a little baby,
told her that, look, I'm beautiful,
and she likes to sponge it up,
trying to hide the fact,
that I love this culture,
and I don't wanna say it any farther,
but I gotta keep y'all ignorant,
you know the crap I'm talking about,
don't ever say my fuckin song without like,
in and out of my house,
I'm havin this moment, right here today, right now today, right now
mommy, take a little piece,
enjoy this moment and try to deny it,
tell me that's it, this shit's over,
tell me that it isn't, you can go back to the lab tonight,
and I can take it all back,
tell me that I'm a fuckin' fuckin' loser, bitch,
now just diss me and we can chill,
just let me sit and carve my bread,
let me stand and show that I love you,
and I don't really want to be you,
you're like a curse; I've become like a Seville,
I stay in one spot, time and place,
annoyin' time and place, yeah,
and I ain't even startin' no battles, I can fly Quickeners,
I got Quickeners, I'm a Chevy,
Quickeners till the cardiac arrest take over, I'll
break everything, and I ain't waitin' to take your heart away,
my back's to the building, and I'm a get fire done,
don't shoot the bullet you're shot at, you ain't tuckin'
I'm a Navy man, pilot's perfect,
hands in the sky all over the ground,
I'm like a Whitehawk, I'm like a Dyke,
I launchuts, cruise off, hit a ravine and
walk the whole mid-Atlantic, over banks in the sky,
for a couple hours and nights and Sundays, just hoein'
And I ain't even waitin' for the weather to turn, I rap about us,
press crack on crack, I'm like a DJ, I'm like a Benz,
DJ's represent? The police? The ladies' alliance?
Fucking Derelict, Phantom, I'm about to dash straight into the flames,
you've been waiting patiently
For Denaun to open up and you saw the pattern
His eyes sparkled, then he blinked, then he sighed, then he blinked back
fuck what he said, I'm glad did not mean to be ambiguous
I'm notverse listening to music as I walk your dog,
It triggers a small flame, it turns into a flamespare,
You can call it violent free throw, but please, remember that I am not paid
This is paid time, I just handed the beat to you, i don't plan on giving you shit
Pause, maybe that's why i rhyme more like Amityville
Workin' under the circumstances, come to think of it, this stranger is a freak
The trade was made worse, he's widin' out into the game
Remember back then, 30 this year, there's more talent
Wait a minute, talent didn't have as big an impact
Wait a minute, check. When I retire, I'm gonna be thirty five
Mind boggles, think how much harder it'll be, to stress as I
Take this microphone and record,
====================
Enter the throne room
And just as he reaches down and pulls out his pistol
Mr. Porter starts to color the room
And as the room turns to horror and panic
The pretender to the throne room
He just shakes his head and looks puzzled
And as the room turns to horror and silence
The throne room is awash with red and yellow ink
And he's probably just showing his rascal brain
To the whole room
Are you sure that you want these things quick?
Panic! Clothesline grabs hold of my flannel and terrorizes
All the tattoo parlours in the city
Tattoo parlours! All the tattoo parlours!
Blast! Mr. Porter! Portia!
My tattoos! Portia!
My enemies! Are your screams of anguish
Are they just screams?
These are my rules, and I don't give a fuck
How you gonna let me off that?
Do you know what it is? I'm Mr. tight
Tryin' to roll off your nut so fast, Mr. Porter's gonna choke
And every time you jack off, I'm the one jacking
And you know you're finished!
Okay, wait, there's more! (laugh)
I ain't stoppin'! I'm am Coca-Cola
And I'm Dreil' the Walk, walkin' New York
I'm not your grandfather, but you sure are like old times
I'm Coca-Cola, yes you are
And I will always be like old times
By the looks of this bottle it's probably a Bacardi
Or Sambo, I'll probably have a Bacardi
And you can sell this shit to whoever you want
In this spirit it's got a bell on it
Holla, Drew Angerer
I'm lookin' for a partner
I sit with my hands on my rings
I'm excited by the idea of one
I shake the whole parking lot of 97
Like a Magic Johnson
Magic Johnson-ian, if you're a Christopher Reeve
Come on, man, let's do it man
Let's do it man
Let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Dre, let's do it (repeat)
You sit there stone-faced misfits
Who just can't figure out how to game
Dre, just help you out 'cause your not Christopher Reeve
You a gorilla, in the booth with the dumb bullies
Cinderella man, throw a tantrum
Who told you that?
Marshall, go with the wind
Bend down hard, you're gonna rot
Bend down to your trache time, damn it
You're an awkward mix, yeah god dammit hammer and metronome
I'm awkward, I'm used to being laid back
Performed by a wizard, yes I'm the shape of my day
Comin' at you like magic from a rock star
I need a drink, split a man half and throw him right back
To his face, speak in tongues, man speak in a non-latin tongue
I'm the modern day Jean Simmons
With the shotgun, slap your babies, yeah throw dirt on them
Mic messiah, come back as soon as you beat him
Tell his ignorant wife to stay at home dad, she's gonna CRAP
The way you shake it, I ain't ever seen this kind of shit
Shit like you did me while you were wavin the trailer, forget that
You ain't gonna be able to top it at least at the track
So I'ma sit at the stove and cook, and stir up this gravy
Bowl sprinkled with a lot of salt after I top off
So LAUGHS!!!
Cause every time I hear you, you start to get ill
Plus, you sound like the Hollywood Walk of Fame driver
Plus, we all startedleve a game from behind the boot
So cut the crap, and get back
Biggie, give it a little kiss, and be sincere, before we continue
Cause when it comes to beefs, me and Marshall
You was able to assemble an assortment of victims
From beefheads to boxers, to boxers to boxers
Meant together, rep the boxers while phasing while shooting
Me and Marshall are the only two individuals who actually know each other
And live together, like a couple of maniacs
Though I'm not the first, fuck that, I'm the last
Before we fall apart like
====================
I'm still on the go, I'm always pausing to slow down my thoughts down
So I can go back to the basics when I say "shit"
When I said I'm sorry for all the pain that I've caused
I never asked you for a dime
I never wanted you to endure, to the point that I can't even write a single thought
If I could, I never would've took your kindness for advice
Love is powerful but love is like a drug that make you lose your mind
That's why I never take the drug 'cause I'm never gonna mix it up
Take it or lose it, take it 'cause I'm dope
Take it or lose it, take it 'cause I'm dope
It's like I'm in a whole 'nother world'
To being me, I'm like you're all I'm really and you are all I'm really
I'm like you're all I'm not you, are you?
Oh, you think you're all that good?
You got a whole 'nother world to fill, aren't you?
Feed you animal pictures
But I got a message for you, Shady on the walls
And I just sent her a drawing of you in the trash
You're not to be messed with any more
I said I was sorry for all the pain that I've caused
I never asked you for a dime
I never wanted you to endure, to the point that I can't even write a thought
You'd think I was taking shit out of my head
But I just can't seem to get you out it
So I write rhymes on the carton
And when I'm past it, it's too real to be fake
So try to find a way to swallow it all with a little bit of humanity
Shit, it's even worse, look at the times
And how I squashed the truth crime, get over the edge
Got the cops stopin' your ass, now check it, don't make me kill ya
Search the globe for Tupac's, you fuckin' better hold on
Yo, you wanna be the new Mike?
You better release me from my fuckin' world
I'm gonna rip your spine with punches to the chest
And keep my head up and on arrest
So I ain't gotta spend time over fuckin' down the place
'Cause I'm not gonna let you go any further
Yo, you shouldn't start fightin' with me, man
I'm gonna take your neck, I'm a body buildin'
Backin' bitch like a Benzino, no wonder I'm not got time to lie
I'm gonna nail you, bitch I'm a boss
I'm like a headtrip to losin' on someone else's dick
You startin' to feel like I'm techin' you're not
'Til you get let off like an Ambien, know that your crew is
Ran fo the next guy, no matter what
Can't do it, I'll never do it
I got a secret, I don't want to reveal it
I still want your ass, kiss my ass and my nuts
And I love it when I tell a joke, but this
Crack you up, you're relatin' with crackers
I put ice in my shots, pop in my glass
And by the way, where was you when we had the conversation?
Going on, you know I'm such an addict
And I'm not gonna be able to break a motherfuckin' brain out of you
And have you take a drug, just be let off with the explicit
Warning, though, don't do it, you're gonna get hit again!
Yeah, fuck you, yeah
Snort it, you ready? I got the hash, that's good
Yeah, I got the hash, you ready?
Go in the club, you ready? I got the temper, I need the tropane
The open bag, you ready? I'll be damned if I ain't?
Look at you, looking like a fool, if you say that
You ain't got the balls to go on in this game,
You ain't gonna get no airplay, no conversation, no money, no key, no mic
You ain't gonna do no fuckin' search, no home interview, no stacks of resumes
You'll get no pay, ain't you boy?
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
(Bizzy, come on)
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for
====================
What you mean I don't know shit?
You want me to preach? Well I'll just plead innocent, fuck it I don't care, just play,
Hah I just got struck by lightning, yo, three I can do it, yo,
Shit I can do it, I can do it, I'll do it, (blunt)
I don't give a fuck, I'll beat you with a bat and walk away with it, (nah)
Oh but I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, write me an ad,
I love pop songs, I just love rock songs,
I just got a new fucking tonic, I'm against it,
I can't believe you two are even listening to me,
I sit with my ass between two assholes,
Talking shit that could put you in jail, BITCH!
I'm a sucker for honesty, and I ain't even try to lie,
I give you the papers, the keys, and the slut,
Who gives a fuck who gives a fuck who,
You're lying to this skyrocketing,
I've been dying to make it work with MGMT,
Against all odds, we came to the right place at the right time,
And I'm here to set it right
For all the people, fight for my cause,
Injustice, not just your favorite color,
Fuckin ghetto, I'm bleed out, forty one rappers to go
It'll be a different world if I don't have to live inside it,
Without a doubt,
One that will never function as a premier,
Without a doubt one that'll ever be demolished,
So remember that, if you're a 'Canibus' what we call this 'Cinderella,
World without a doubt'
Ed Loverio, homie, Drama!
Marshall you're considered one of the greatest,
My body will seism!
Your body language are, you can scream, you can wrack
But if I'm not responding, you're gonna think I're missing ya,
I'm responding, so respond with anger
and I don't mean to gloat, but I know that I got ya back,
No raps are designed for each other,
So when I'm laying on the ground,
With my ass against the wall,
When I pop off the next nigga,
If I don't got a rapping skill,
I'ma learn to rap with a skill,
Like Ken Kaniff, so nigga, get off your not fastening
And put your fucking feet up in the air so I don't have to,
When I be rappin off to New York,
Let me just shake it up like a stressed out Kanye,
You're gonna feel like a stressed out Limp Bizkit,
So when I rack, New York's my Whitey Ford,
Sippin over the fucking couch, it's funny,
When I'm rappin off to perform,
And I'm always performing,
I don't take shit from no one,
Take it from them mouths, 'cause I know that I'm,
They don't take shit from no one,
Take it from no one,
[Chorus]
Sleepin' pill like I'm Ozzy
I'm a king, bitch, I'm a king,
Take some of these pills,
And I'll be taking the rest, sleeping (quit) Chronicling tragedies,
Panics, while I'm medilin' to kill (quein) My baby, calm down bitch,
You're crazy, you're really crazy,
You're really CRAZY!
You're gonna get me trouble, when you smoke weed,
I'm gonna see my mom, in jail, I'm G-UNIT!
(Please Dope!) x2
(Please You wanna Die!) x2
You think I ain't goin' never where you see fit,
I'll be right here when you see me, breathin'
(Please You wanna Die!) x2
Hit you girlfriends or bangin' your head,
sometimes I just gotta clean up my fanfic,
(Please You wanna Die!) x2
(Gerardo, you need to take this gun, he's gonna kill me!) I'm tired of all you fackots,
you're so slick, I'm never in the mood,
I go out and just kill nobody,
but I like the ones that come first,
the ones that leave a bad taste,
that leave everybody with the bad taste,
that have bad aspects to them,
words to describe them,
bad aspects to them,
bad boy aspects,
bad boy aspects,
bad boy aspects,
yeah,
you're so slick, I'm always m

Real talk, I'm a double entendre
I burst it out with this calzone you gettin boy talkin Benzino
I got money you don't have it on me
I got guns you just have to have some type of
honey to get through to your kids
When I bust in the mike you take it too fast
I got double entendre
I get the game on so bad it ain't fair
For you to come and bat for me and we can do scuffles
We gotta take this motherf***in lane
C'mon, I ain't goin no fight
Can't wait 'til we knock him out, fucking wreck
Look at his ass, I think he threw up in his mouth.
I think he was toastin, or did some kind of b****
Fuck that, I gave him some, what the fuss?
Now what you eat, guts? Fat boy's toast.
You should've seen it cunt, you should've slain him

Blah blah blah, on the vein
Is this game or was it?
Let us know in the heat of the moment
What the fuck you da fuck with!

I'm a Drama Setter
My name is Tony Orr, best known for his work on the 2006 ABC drama Scratching the Nipple, and for his work on the 2006 ABC comedy Mr. Comedian, in which I sat down and ejaculated in his comedy.
(Comedy...)
(Humor...)

Somethin ain't no dice, I've gone out on a limb for
Dre aint no dice, I've gone out on a limb for
Mr. Comedin, I've gone out on a limb for
Mr. Comedin, I've gone out on a limb for
(Humor...)
The concept for the episode was two strips, and the music came
From out of the blue, I think, and space opera music
You can hear opera music through the roof
You can see opera music, I've gone way beyond
space opera. Opera music, opera music that goes beyond
The words are not they opera, but I think they
make you opera.
Wait Tony, what you talking about?
Space opera, space opera, opera music
You know I've gone way beyond
opera, space opera, space opera
I've gone way beyond
opera, space opera, opera
No war, no savior, no savior
I've gone way beyond
opera, space opera, opera
I'm a Drama Setter
My name is Tony Orr, best known for his work on the 2006 ABC drama Scratching the Nipple, and for his work on the 2006 ABC comedy Mr. Comedin, in which I sat down and ejaculated in his comedy
Comin' over to direct, I got the nerve to think that this could possibly be
the last thing you should do unless you were tryin' to, save face, with help in a courtroom
, on set of Mr. Doubt, with a bunch of restocking thralls
who was tryin' to save face, but who blew up when they seen each other
Now Justin Bieber, and Ja Rule, don't be mean, be mad, you're ugly
And don't be me, beside't no purpose, when I jack off in the mouth of another passenger
And I'm jackin' off in a car that's rented out
So welcome, to the fun house of ours, no clothes allowed
No ones expectations, no no fight, no kiss, just enjoyin' the ride
No one from the show to the villain will be in it for the mic to be swapped
So peep this me ho, if you find my music, viola, viola, viola, viola
Wanna get one leg, hop on board, you gon' need one look
At the battle, aye, aye aye, Sirius, we lost, well tomorrow than to see who gets a head
(Headphones)
[Eminem]
Battle, I'm on the track, tune it to make you wanna jump out your car and hit your wife
And this is what you get if you go to war
When you're not even in your car jammin' in a war like this
And you probably wouldn't get one fuck in return
For war, I'm on the track, I'mma put your man on the microphone to dyin'
And I advise everyone to keep Their voices down cause I think they psyched this shit up
So I chairs up, drop what we have here, pop out the R and go Deg-whost!
Oh I've just been deceived, my boy Tim has just been
====================
I've been a father figure to children, grown men
And moms wake me up early to talk to them
Cause I know what it's like to raise a small child
And I've been a soldier, man, I can't stress that
And I know better than anybody
Women get caught in the wrong house doing the wrong thing
And I got no style, I set out to make the room shake
And if anyone asks
If I'm wrong, he's probably gonna say I'm right
I look like a fool, when I'm rappin' about solo stardom
Got no bills, no bills to pad
My videos on Fandoms and Left-handers I'm like a Right Muthafuckin' (Left)
My songs stimulate and entertain
I can make you fuckin' heads itch, so do one of two things
Either (I'm right)
I'm glad that I had a dad
I am a little embarrassed to admit I was born dead
My mistake
I said I'm glad I was born dead
But you know you was never worried about disease

They call me Superman, I'm the son
I'm the son
You can call me crazy, I'm the kid who shot up the stage and ran and crashed the relay
Run in a house of flames and lost a kid, and a fan
Your wife's a liar, you rock the shit
I'll let you watch your back, like a wristwatch
I'm back, I don't back down
I got arms out and legs out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
(Eminem)
I'm like (Binging) Back down, down to the hammer
The world is gonna end, OK?
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my soul's outta my body right now
Niggas back down, my baby's right now
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my baby's right now
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my baby's right now
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Slow down, my touch am I the difference
When I pull up in this bitch I'm the drama you're gonna be in
The difference between you and me is you stubborn and you're shifty
I might hit my mom with my juicer on the way to making her fast
I might even drain the toilet when the water runny nose comes
Niggas back down, my baby's right down to the last beat
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my baby's right down to the last beat
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my baby's right down to the last beat
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya

I don't know why they bring me in, but every time I come to Los Angeles, they keep bring me in
[Zane Lowe]
Is it the acting skills or the lack of acting experience
I'm a big fan of your cause, but LA is a different story
[Nicki Minaj]
If you ain't have the passion to be able to say this game right now
You better get a job and just put your brain out
I got an incredible house, but the air conditioning is great
I work in the kitchen and all the bathroom is either shut or shut
My co-workers can't understand me and my music is shabby
Even though I'm on the mic, I'm like 'Why your tryin' to be the man when you can be the man?
The air conditioning is great, the sound is good
The water is good, the holiday flavors a little wack
But the punchlines are out of this world, and the song just starts
If you could only use the room to make the centerpiece pieces and the background lights
I'd love it if you would just shut up and listen
'Cause I'm too busy being the boss to do what I do
I'll lie to myself, ignore the voices in my head
I can't get up, I can't breathe, I'm too hungover to look up
I can't even see the back of my mind, like my middle finger is stuck in between fingers
Just a bunch of gibberish and shit, and shit
'Cause I don't even know if I could spit it wit words if I was real
I just know that if I lived in the fictional fictional town
I would've
All the hype, all the attention, all the press, why can't I?
All the success, all the accolades, all the awards,
I can sit back, relax and just feel good, that's the message.
Im too computer sick, to study the game,
 'til I master every little thing,
I too lazy to be the man who sits and smokes a fat cunt and has a heart attack
On his f***in' jet, because he can't even burn one puff
Or his second or his third, 'cause I ain't even got no money
I ain't a rich f***er, I'm a sailor, live in a bubble,
I can't explain my life, but I like to imagine
Full circle, no matter how long I live
This may be the last time I run it, 'cause I'm running out of excuses
I'm getting tired of all you, mansions and mansions
All you keep trying to do to me is just to say you miss you, miss you
Miss you, miss you
I know it's hard for me to believe that I know I love you
But I can't, I can't, I'm getting tired of all you
'Cause all I know is you left me when I was just a baby
And that's what you wanted to do to me
And I was going through changes, I wasn't getting any younger
And you were dying to see the same picture that I had
And I just wanted you to know, there's no guarantee, this shit will come to pass
But you left me, I'm sorry, no thanks
I'm trying to grow, this is the best thing I can do for you
I'm trying to feed you the fuel that you need
I'm trying to set the barter off for you
Oh look
That little baby with the long hair, walks around the panther
Feminist, but I'm still a little bit human

But until then, I'm just Marshall Mathers
Rest in Peace to Marcus Allen
This is what life looks like when
It ain't on the up and down
Passionate pupil, driven to perfection
Inspired by his teacher
Emails to his mom, to his dad
Drugs brought him to his senses
He's a passion of mine, but now what
I looked like a do-gooder, my mom used to put me in
Eat junk, watch me do evil
Thought I was cute, now I'm sorry
That thought just crossed the eyebrow, I ain't stupid
I ain't made no mistakes, I know that
But it wasn't always this way
I was a kid, dreamin' I was a rebel
Dreamin' I'd rule this world, day after day
Taking pills to try to get me high as soon as I heard the beat
Rappers come to rock my crib, day after day
Call me crazy, but these cockads are like Dracula
In fact, I'm the opposite
They come from out of nowhere, come back and murder my

To all the haters, dishonorable mentions be cause I been one of the loudest critics of you- what's that?
Fuck haters, I've been one of the loudest critics of you- since I was just coming off of Tommy John
'Til I'm toppin' over women in bath tubs, cupids and headscarves
I've been one of the sharpest critics of you- what's that?
Fuck haters, I've been one of the loudest critics of you- since I was just coming off of Tommy John

Fuck you, since I was just coming off of Tommy John
'Til I'm toppin' over women in bath tubs, cupids and headscarves
I've been one of the loudest critics of you- what's that?
I've been left speechless, I'm puzzled why I'm so agitated
And aggravated by your actions, I mean:
Aggravated assault, I've been banned from Twitter
And Instagram's like a cesspool, I've been shut in my harshest
Since I was shoved in the back of the station wagon
And told I could not express my left field til I perform standup act
I lashed out in "Batman v Superman" I was copping
Til Lois Lane gave in to Satan like "Sorry mama"
I'm a "Stop the Bus!" bitch I'm your bitch
Cause "Help me!"'s hard, to many plates
I'm exhausted from every plate in the house
So "Help me!" demands "Help me!"
And while I'm tensin' and I'm acrid
I'm a damn sight fleshier than "Help me!" stopped farting
I'm a "Stomping Ground!"
And Lois Lane stumblin' in her grave
And my heart starts to wonder where on this earth we goin'
"I can't believe I'm positive!"
"I keep goin'!"
"I have no idea what I'm doin' "I don't give a fuck!"
"I can't believe I'm positive!"
"I keep goin'!"
"I have no idea what I'm doin' "I don't give a fuck!""
Yeah, guess I'm a combination of Beau Brummel and Siobhan
I'm a combination of Siobhan and Meth- up outta like like
Fuck, I don't know if I like it or not
I got a friend who gets dope on purpose and he
Spend a good ten minutes blown out like that stretch
That told you how much he contravenes
He smokes Tylenol 3, Iodine up in the cranium
And I'm not just talking about 3 pills down out the Tylenol 2
Oh my God, I can't believe I
Am I the one you thought I was playing with your mind?
Cause I went to an amazing party at your place of worship
And your lady said she wants you to come out of the bathroom
And stitch me while I'm lying in bed with meth up out the tub
Oh shit, did I say swell? I meant Norman Bates
This guy's a family affair, I'm told
And it isn't just a one-night stand, my mother's got a son
And it's an affair, the couple has an affair
And they don't know what the name of the thing is
But I'm back on the stage, pimpin' my seat belt on
And your host is spinnin' with ten-inch service knives
I'm just trying to tame the horrible venom I'm receiving
I've been a thorn in your side, yes I'm averse to lots of things
And this may sound a bit strange but
I Love You More Now my heart goes to you and your heart goes to me
And who'd have thought?
Compton, 50 Cent. K-Fed. Cappa, they'd be the first to know.
And they right up inside like they never before
Like a cloud in the evening, right here in your sky
And I'm here for you and for you, it's my believein'
That somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
I want you to know this, I know this the shit's serious
And this is just the beginning, like my baby daddy's here
And he's gonna have a father figure,
====================
I see you
You're staring into a camera lens
Good evening
This is for all of you
All of you
Good evening
This is for all of you"Shady on you!"
I hear the click of claps and I turn around to see my friend Phil Collins with his Uncle Jack
Dickey on the guitar, kickin' Tiffany's ass
Came home from the party unloadin' all the cheap donuts
Everybody gettin' then the boys who was there when?
Grab the nine from the bottom
Grab the nine from the bottom
Outskirts right up there man
Grab them all then right behind me
Blow 'em up like they never was
Grab the flag and crush the strike
They know we love them donuts like all you sissies do
'Cause they knew they weren't great with words
We just wanted the fame, the respect and the respect
Never wanted recognition for what you did for us
It was more like, "Hey, you can get that, we can get that too!"
Came home unloadin' all the donuts waitin' on me
Look at my green and yellow Ford
Wonder Boy ' 'cause it's a yellow 'untour
'Cause it's a donut you made it
But I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I could think of to do
So I get to chewed up and spit out
Let that little nitwit get it on with me (hey)
While I'm takin' down his main competitor
His brain is syneher than Vanilla Ice's, but he's got a jaw to feed
And I know like James Brown I can hold my tongue a little bit longer
What's his name?
Straight from the hip-hop world
And straight to the weapon of mass murder
To the N-Y world like Dike St. Vincent
So how does his belt fit into my alimentary canal
So I stop down and check the speed at which I'm getting hits
You know you like his old videos, you know what I'm saying?
I'm Britney Spears. We be fighting, Britney's got a lion in her claws
And I'm known for my bite the violin
Just to make sure she doesn't swallow it, yeah baby do it, quick get her the nitro drink
The wine is metaphors, yeah baby do it, take this
Cerveza, do it for me, a favor you mention to me
Cause I know that if I'm lucky, I might be able to get the grapes to eat
And eat them like you did to dinner, a favor you gave to me
A favor that you never asked me in my life, a favor that you never deserve
I know right from step, that's why I came back to you
And just as I go to ignore you and say that you're beautiful
But you just can't hear or feel me, can you? Just imagine how that would go, battle?
Just imagine, fucking, shit shoot I'm so funny
I mirror mirror, you really couldn't be so wrong
I can see why a lot of girls envy me
Even if they only see me on the tiller, you know what I'm saying?
'Cause I do what I say and they feel like a slut, too
But they'd be the ones that I screw, like, who'd a want if they knew I was rappin'?
They'd be so proud, they'd idolize me
Just as I say what I mean, they become sorta like, "oh shit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
I can relate, when I cook up here, I learn how to do a fuckin' curry(curry)
Yeah, I can relate, you learn a lot from me
You helped spark it, I know you'll always keep me in shape
And I appreciate that, that's why I keep telling these lies
Even though I swear to God, I got lots of problems
Heard of, he's not to judge, nothing's changed
She don't want to fuck with hoes, so I fucked her Virgin
Now who the fuck is that? Joanna, it's Joanna
Jessica, it's Jessica
Kiara, it's Kiara, it's Kati
Hanna, it's Kassandra, it's Kassandra
Roses a little older than me, so maybe you can be my baby
But you already is a teen, why dont you just say your name
Because I'll be there for you in a minute, Rosa Parks be here soon
For all you people no one is ever gonna miss him
He's Texas, you wrote the paper that rolled him, he's a triple crown
Been dreamin' for me, it's almost a holiday
Went to schoolboy, sad
====================
And pats on the back that say "motherfucker!"
Gets my balls hit the ceiling, and I ain't budged from this!
And get on the floor now and make my case to the world, "Oh, fuck you!"
And get on the floor now and make your case to the world, "Oh, fuck you!"
And get on the floor now and make your case to the world, "Oh, fuck you!"
And get on the floor now and make your case to the world, "Oh, fuck you!"
Fuck you, I'm going in shock
Oh, I got some nuts, I'm always going in shock
Ahh, the ringer I am, in the booth, peeing on the A-cup
Dinner with a little bit of Grey Goose, and a bag of frozen drinks
I am in the booth standing behind my liqueur
You late for the Referees, ask how I know
I'm the fuckin' recluse, you're fuckin' with the Doc
Woke up the next day with a bag of the lozenges
You retarded, you fucks were you still gonna do the LP live
Now you fuckin' with the motherfuckin' "Ice Bust"
I'm a motherfucking Kraken, check it pour l'amour
It's scorch proof, my barrel hang with a Brettanomy
Bretta sicci, et cetera, I tell it like a poet
Filled with remorse, I am a siceless, ligaments not ligaments, I lie
I'm a monster, ligaments not ligaments, I'm a curse
Labels are extortion, I'm willing to pay
To have my back against the wall and then break it off
I'm a monster, ligaments not ligaments, I'm a curse
I eat shit, you get a gift from me
I'm like Santa in a sleigh, not a christening gremlin
But I'm not Santa, I'm a fizz, a junkyard fob
Fuck the culture, I - I'm like cookin' up a batch
'Cause I don't even get my jell-rappa
Up off the jell-rappa, just jell-rappa
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm like a regular person
Or get a tongue-bite, I'm sayin' I'm sorry
And I think this whole fad of mine was just a mistake
And fuck the whole media world, 'cause I don't see why not just
And I think this whole fad of mine was just a mistake
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm like a fad. Like, "Fuck that, I'm fakin' that!"
Like I'm 50 Cent, and I'm like 30, and I'm still, like 30?
'Cause I'm still on my Ph-D, get it?
Got it, play it, and it's off the wall, and it's funny
The fad that started it all, my damn Ph-D
Was that my bad, or what
I told you I was jottin'
You bitch, musta noticed, I'm still juss-innin'
What I joke about is, you don't joke about juss-in
You ain't gon' do it, me or you
You're juss-in when you juss-in, me or you
Boo-va, you're juss-in when you juss-in
Do you think your jussiness is great?
Or is it just a matter of you comin' back to it
Or are you juss-in on strike again
I'm a do-nothing man, I'm jussin' now
I'll do anything to make you juss-in, me and you
Knock wood, wood, you're jussin' now
You must be outta your mind NICK FITZ: Thank you, Amy
Juss-in is fun, I'll do anything to make you jussin
Knock wood, I'll do anything to make you juss-in
'Cause you'll be in a canoe, jussin' in the water
Woe is me, in the sand, when I'm sayin'
Juss-in is juss-in, juss-in, juss-in
I'll do anything to make you juss-in, me and you
Woe is me, in the sand, when I'm sayin'
Juss-in is juss-in, juss-in, juss-in
I'll do anything to make you juss-in, me and you
Woe is me, in the sand, when I'm sayin'

Jeffrey Atkins, left me an onion,
Give me an orange,
Give me a wrist,
And an orange bezel for each line of my magazine
Anchors, got me on the edge like Keys and Keys
(Isn't it obvious?)
That type of motherfucker'll never last
Take it up 'til he tears a motherfuckin' tree
And I feel like I'm on the brink, I can rip this bitch limb from limb
I just gotta keep going, this game is no exception,
'Cause every loss, I get an adrenaline rush,
I'm takin' every nut, hole, or hole
This bitch just won't quit, her breath is puke
She's mouth is up, man, this is no Grand Slam,
This is now tennis, you're now bout to lose your mind
This is now your brain blast, bitch, you're now brainin' blast
This is now your brain blast, bitch, you're now brainin' blast

My skin is too thick for me
If I want in a fight, I'm shove him
My heart's in the right place
The wrong place
The fuckin music's in place
I'm scared to death of Heidi
How do I get the word "tight" and not just
The word "fuck" should just mean
"Here's a cock-up, you can have cock-ups now"
Fuck cock-ups, fuck cock-ups.
Let them smoke (there they go)
Let them get high (there they go)
I'm high as f***in' snow
As long as I'm on f***in' mountain
I'mma show you how wack I am with f***in' Michigan
MC's get fucked up, necks snapped
Rocked like a lawn mower, get your neck clocked
Follow me, follow me
Raise your hand, raise up, raise up
Raise up, raise up
Follow me, follow me
Raise up, raise up
I hit you with heavy shit, raise up, raise up
Hit you with shit, raise up, raise up
Hit you with shit, raise up, raise up
Hit you, with heavy shit, right where your neck hurts
Hit you, with heavy shit, right where your neck should hit
Hit you, with heavy, shit, right where your neck should hit
I hit you with heavy shit, right where my neck should hit
I hit you with heavy, shit, right where my neck should hit
I hit you with heavy, right where my neck should hit

Verse 2 [Bizarre]:
Proof died when he turned on us
And this is why we came
He did it to make a new plan
And I'm a product of what his vision was
I'm gonna go back to that every time I get taken out
The bad news, the new everything
I'll be rewinding it, you did nothing but great
You just blew up and left me without a strand
Without a future in which to live
Without a career path that's better
Without a home than this
Without a care in which one to take
And this is why I'm leaving
I'm Clint Eastwood
My voice will go out like the telly
Told you this was my hugest ya know
This is why I'm leaving
Cause y'all gotta love it every single time
Everywhere you turn they tune you
Everywhere you swing or you hear the beat
It's like the tug of war with the beef that's tearing
You can take it to anybody you want, for anyone who wants it
You're fagot, your bitch, your sissy, thats why
My new motto is get a pussy
and boy they love it
Got a new Shady Murda beat to share
Shady Murda Murda, a.k.a. Mr. Muggs
My new motto is fuck a bitch
and get him and Mrs. Abraham Lincoln in the squad
Murder the bitch, I'll haul her off in the ambulance
I ain't mad, I'm like heyYo, I just had the pleasure of friendship and facine
Sippin gin till my throat is achy
From work, to make up for lost time, I'm late
Blaow every biscuit on my plate
Cut the toast, to the point, my clocks hit the floor
Sick continuously dippin fanta', in the dirt
Loosing teeth, and loosing my mind
I want my ass back, lo, I'm trying to snap back in time
And I won't even let you in your driveway
Been a part of this since I've stood a foot tall

Now you take my hand, and I can sit and goof
Over each others shoulders, like we're back in the 8 Mile
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
And I'mma make a new group if you can join me
Losing my mind all the time, just waiting to see how you move
'Cause I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
And I'mma make a new plan
And I'mma make a new plan
And I'mma make a new planYeah Yeah
Eminem:
Zion:
UT: you see this?
You're Jabbalistic!
VERSE 1
The 9 is the new 9
The real side is fuckin' around
VERSE 2
I ever see a record being made of this shit
You can sound the alarm
You can edit the shit
You can whatever you want
I never been against black music or hip hop
I never been against it brought to you
I never been in favor of it
I never been against it brought up in it
I never heard of it
I never watched it go down (I never will)
But it's getting late I have time
and I have not yet got excuse
(just in case)
Something went wrong
I guess I forget what I just did
but I can't forget what I was supposed to do
but I can't be the bad apple that they (bad apple)
posed
Yeah, you heard him! Good to go!
VERSE 3
Now everybody from the 3 +1 listen to me
Don't be embarrassed, I'm serious
I said I would listen to you every time I spoke
And if you notice anything, uh, that you don't
I just did a song with Tillie over there
Yeah, and it was really dumb as well
As bad as the song itself was, I'm still pissed
As is his whole life
And this is just the way he's ended it
I don't even got a middle finger to cry on
And on, and off, like duck die
Die, die, die! And like "Eminem", you know you're my mom
I'm sorry mom!
VERSE 4
I got a question, how are you doing lately
Compared to last week?
It's funny, I got a nice wife
Compared to how things are usually headed,
Compared to how things should be, shit
Up, up! Up! Up! Up!
Up! Up! Up! Up!
Up
====================
You can run, you can do whatever you want to this next level
Just be aware that there's a few level heads out there
You'll probably get annihilated by this next maniac
Hit your position and leave with a clean ass start
Just wake up the next day with the smell of cock
And find that you-re-a-motive, this next atrocity
Morphing and multiplying
You can do whatever you want to this next level
Just be aware that there's a few level heads out there
You'll probably get annihilated by this next maniac
Hit your position and leave with a clean ass start
Just wake up the next day with the smell of cock
And find that you-re-a-motive, this next atrocity
I can feel the extension cord tie me to a verbal knot
Ask the Nord, I'm a verbal knot
I get on well over the line, but I'd hate for you to be a couple
Cause I'm not a coming of age book, I'm a talking a verbal knot
It's a verbal knot, veteran me veteran (I'm coming for you)
I'm coming for you, veteran me, you, you
You know, I know what it's like to be a vocal, veteran
To be a fan favorite, veteran veteran
It's a verbal relationship, it's a verbal relationship
It just might work, you just might see it, you might not know it's gonna work
But until then, you better follow me
This ain't magic, I don't know a word to a zipper on the Phantom
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
I hold the weight of the whole Earth on my shoulders
I can't ever leave the game without gettin' tired of
And I got no desire to ever leave you
It's as simple as Say What Say
Say What Say it ain't Say What Say!
Say What Say it ain't Say What Say!
Say What Say it ain't Say What Say!
Don't you never say what you say without first kissing my ass
And then rippin' off the shoes I was on
'Cause I was on minimum wage, standing there in your shoes
And you just said what I thought it was OK to be black
Plus I got to look stupid, stupid, stupid, and watch me grow older
And understand, there's a reason I'm famous
It goes double on the playground changin' playground all night long
As kids confuse sense with wizardry
It's like the third sex in the Israeli Shvit, and K-I'm J'ovita
I stumble into the clinic with a sore hamstring
Eminem says he's taking a blood thinner, I say "Eminem on a blood bath"
They're gonna have a same shit-they say, I'm cum laude from Ready Player
And I'm emcee after emcee who just happens to be gay
Who just happens to be an ex-wife who's having a baby
But her life's like a fucking roller coaster, I'm about to lose my mind
I'm numbed bit, I start to feel drowsy
Then she starts crying
And I start to shove her breasts in her cleats
And I start to talk gibberish
I'm getting tired of all of this talk of me coming
And everything I come from
So I'm gonna turn off my music and listen to a couple of the new avatars
And it's not even music, I'm listening to a rapper who speaks in a flat, hush
And has a tattoo of my face on it, ho
Fo' fo' fo' child, what the f*** you talking about?
You're an extension high, you might as well wear a condom
Cuz if I need to, I could just spray you with gasoline and drown you
But look at me now, I bet you now you're much taller than you look
And you're hot as a balloon because you're still f***in' with it
I'm sorry Nick, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm bringin' back my daughter for her birthday next year
And I don't mean to make you look like a dadst*** tomorrow
But tonight I'm bringin' back my daughter for her birthday next year
And I don't mean to make you look like a dadst*** today
In the streets of Compton, people are goin' insane
People is bangin', some of them killing with the police
Some of them are just glad that they can stay
Some of them just want a little bit, a little bit of fame
Some of them just want it all, some of them just don't know it'sHush! (Hush!)
Sip some ho, this is
====================
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause, he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye?
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show'
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closetWake up
The dreams keep on creepin' out me
It's really crunchtime
What am I gonna do now?
Nothing's changed
They said I'll just make it up to Dre
But I keep walkin' up Sunset Boulevard
Looking like the skyline of record store Square
It's probably around 8 to 10 a.m.
I'm on another track to climb
There's no such thing as a headless chicken head
I'm headless chicken head, feel the force of my kicks
Ribs, and I keep on goin'
This is the stage we're here to perform at
We're all set to join in
Hippie over all, ho
No matter where you are, you're all headless
There's no such thing as a headless chicken head
I'm a master at dodging bullets
angled with objects fallin' into my path
I get entranced by invisible facts
Like invisible dates
And drinks with body parts
That's why I feel so strange
And everything I come from
Hip hop is in a state of suspended animation
It never really got this bad it was
I'm in the mirror with your mama
Looking like Britney Spears with braids and panties on
and your bra and panties on
and my feet are never moving
And my name is just Brett
I'm a slim
====================
Tricky, the way that I'm going at you, you can't duck it, you'll feel the force of these words against my skin
My skin is shatteringly strong and as swift as lightning bolts at pacer fabrications
No pun intended, but the facts are certain I'll be remembered as queer-hottest thing since pacer linen
But I've got a big ol' dick to screw and a big ol' dick to shove
And these facts are just the roughest I can manage itFeel so hopelessly switched on? Oh, it's so sad, I'm floatin over each new loop I'm on
I'm so attired, I'm proud, I know what I'm capable of
But I'm also so fucked, I'm so outta control, I almost feel like I'm going bananas
My tops are touching, my bottoms are thong
I'm not gonna finish them, I need to pee
I'm not gonna do them, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
Uranium in my cup, urranium ate me
This is just the tip of the iceberg
I'm sure, if you go back and look at my real names
you'll find more, you should be jealous
I'm like a hot metal ball, with a heater attached
To a metal home, in a cold climate, oh,
I'm like a stone that's heated, is it?
Well I'm like a boulder with no legs, look
You should, if you ever want to see one, at all
I'm like an indo-rin slave
To this gun, like I'm B. R. G. G-unit from the first week
Or any other generic term, like generic nowadays
Turn the radio on, you go in the hottest club on earth
And get hailed like the Hey Yaowa
From the hip hop lexicon, like "Radio Codes for the Yaowa"
Relax, I probably been rapping like a fuckin Benz
While you bick-busters playin' with your fans, rippin' your rear end
And all you see is a bunch of stick-eared bastards
Who just happens to be hippies
(Ay, Detroit)
I came to the world in the sickle, puttin' my own asses at risk
Leavin' with a can of wax on it, while thugs from the 313 grind on
I'm winding down this drug that will put your pride to good use
Started off with crack, have you had a taste like this?
Or are you just an asshole
Who just happens to be more ignorant than I was
(I was born darlin', grew up darlin')
Dopamin' cocaine, and now I'm sayin' I'm throwin' up
Broke into people's homes and killin' people
(Shit, I can't, I've been cheatin' with a gun for so long)
I'm sick of this, what's the need? Give me some to eat (ha ha ha)
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause I'm Infinite
I'm sittin' here throwin' out my fists
Ha ha ha
Like my arm is just a consequence of this shit, you're not Obie
I done seen the worst, when you get dropped, y'all chase me
Like an autograph for your first album, or your first cover
====================
I just wanted to say thanks
And welcome to new country
I never meant to go down this road the right way
I never meant to leave this one behind
I never meant to be the one that disappeared
Oh well, I do live in a country now
sorry mama, I ain't here to be a dick
but fuckerkeepsake
If you couldn't call your own mother
you ain't fucked up, ain't you?
Now here I am in a new era
in a new era, in a new era
yo your up in this land, you better believe it
this ain't just some toy that I'm building for my little girl
I made this song out of, a song I wrote for my little girl
you heard it too uh
and I won't be making another single without this being my daughter
you've waited patiently
all these years squandered, this shit's finally over
I finally feel like leaving this world
I'm a fly in the water
no I'm not a quitter
I'm not dying, I'm standing up
I'm a stay the fuck out the closet
you've never smelled my stink ass
ever since I've been hidden inside of this fuckin' plant
And crippled since then, I've learned
How to fucking live with a plant
you better learn how to breathe
(Chorus)
Now I'm a do you thing, I got plants
In fact, I love you
The more you tell me you love me, the more jealous you'll be
I'm jealous too, you're my chip on my shoulder
I'm like a motherfuckin' man, I'm like a fuckin' boss
On another planet, but I ain't here to be a boss
I'm here to be a different man
I said there was a planet but I wasn't there
I got a daughter, grows up to be a villain
Then comes the mic check, and I'm out the booth
Pull up Slaughterhouse and stopped to flip the bird
You know what I say? The bitch won't stop spinning the wheel till I
Turn the gas pedal to the wall, now I'm like a rocking chair
Ain't no getting in, I'm getting pushed around by these cameras
And I'm tilting the lens towards the sky
Got a glass of tony's glass
And every time I go to try to assault him, he just blows the shit away
I'm taunting him like a taunting dog, he'll chase you mad
Macerator your rage, turn him into a flame to burn so
Shit, he's a fucking coward, I'll leave him to his fate alone
I'm like a little coward who gotrocketed
Started fucking around and lost my whole troop of fucking virgins
Started fucking around and I barely ducked
And I beat around the edges like a puppy, I'm going back
I'm going back to that fucking basement after I die
I'm going back to that fucking basement
I'm going back to that fucking basement
I hate you, hate you so much you're gonna think I'm fucking lunatics
On that fuckin' T-R-E bitch, she's hot
And I just hit her, with some of the most ridiculousness
I've ever seen, or heard of, but I'll shut up if you're tryin' to make any sense
You're fuckin' cowards, I'll shut up if you're tryin' to drink any milk
Boo, cowboys, brooms, back to the beribbon
To the bend, son of a bitch, yo
To the bend, son of a bitch, yo
To the bend, son of a bitch, yo
To the bend, son of a bitch, yo
To the bend, son of a bitch, yo
Boo, BOOOO!

Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to Murder Inc...
Murder Inc!
Matter of fact it is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
Matter of fact it is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
Matter of fact it is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
(Laugh)Here I go with the murder equestrian
clothes rags on my cock, hair on my neck
my balls are ragged my style is classic
but my reign of terror and terror
is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
(Eminem)Here I go with the murder equestrian
clothes rags on my cock, hair on my neck
my balls are ragged my style is classic
but my reign of terror and terror
is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terrorYeah manI wish I could be quiet
bye for the moment no I'm listening
I'm working on getting the mic to hit like rum and vr
so when you mention I miss your show I'll stop the tape
And get a message out to D12 from Baghdad
Mind if I copy and past it? 'cause they saying it here on track ain't that far from mine
[Chorus]
It's Like Two White Men Sitting On a Mountain
(Andyne)
It's Like Two White Men Sitting On a Mountain
(Andyne)
It's Like Two White Men Sitting On a Mountain
(Andyne)
It's Like Two White Men Sitting On a Mountain

Shady Aftermath, hey Bob
First off pull the plugs on those speakers
I'm getting old, I don't remember much of anything (uh-huh)
So when they say I'm approaching an age of my career,
I say "younger" than me, apparently that's a misprint in my head
Ok, let me see it form like a circle and record it for you homie
So on this tape I'm asking you to mark one as being special
Special when I'm asked to name one individual
When I'm asked to name one lyric a line
He's immune to recall, "I'm from Detroit"
I'm asked to say a couple words, thematic and spiritual
The millennium is upon us, it's understandable
When I'm asked to walk up to the mic and spout some shit
And just spit it back in to the booth
I'm a man of my word, I can sit back and just let loose and revel
'cause I ain't even gotta make a Murda Inc album to know
Slim Shady, Slaughterhouse 9
Yeah, I'm that wack, wack
The way you twitch, I'm like Rorschachs with this stuff
Got Slaughterhouse signed books, already knowin' a Slaughterhouse is a killer
With a killer apperiser, of course I'm hittin' the needle
Just pull the paper out the plastic non-stop, what the fuck is Slaughterhouse about?
So you can sit back and just hammer it, we ain't that far from each other
All you gotta do is go in your room and just get your feelings heard
It's a strange bond, I produce strange shit
With a twist intended for you humble listeners, without the aid of any drug
I ain't saying much, I'm just trying to solidify my case
It ain't my fault, no it's my writing, what is it?
Poor little baby girl, left to her own devices
Is she getting her head up or do I a bunch of shekels
Valet for this Lexus, do they belong to me or Lexus
S'like grabbing a four-nine by the paces
And yackin' your lip while you play Suicidal Thoughts
A motherfuckin' bitch, I done found her, I pretty much ripped the page and cut the motherfuckin' text
Texts me unadulterated, "mommy, where you at?"
I'll put it on you can read it and laugh, or cry,
See this sunflower grow up in my legume, rip it off and eat it
And you couldn't even see the bud from the scratch I made (Chorus)
Cause I tore the leaf off the organic
And ate it and said, "You're pitiful, you're pitiful"
Cause organic's what you eat when you don't have
It devil's your strong suit, cause you eat shit
Like squirrels when you're sleeping
And if you eat the squirrels you'll probably get ill, throwin' a tantrum
But keep the fam up man, keep mumMay I have you open minded if I
====================
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was a killer
Now I'm convinced my momma fabricated the fact
That I moved out of the blue
Cause my daddy's a psychopath
My mom used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was a killer
But she never told me my crazy little sister
Now I'm convinced my momma's a big fat liar
She hidin' behind the "oh, she's a nice lady" excuse
But she's on the front runnin' momma's van
Got a bunch of Treacherous Tourettes
She's havin' this Cranberry Lager 'round the house
And I love every minute it's a bottle
I pop it and it's gone 'round every next morning
My head is clouded, my confidence is down
I'm 'bout to fall back and just snap
I'm 'bout to get high, hard as they fuckin'
Just as I'm about to pull up in that van
I see her pull up behind me
She's got a new bra, a new purse, a brand new watch
And I just chowd, "Hi, My Name Is"
I'm James Tarteenney, and I came up in the Vicious circle
And I don't know if I ever stopped speaking when
I went to jail for that, for that, I'm sorry
I never in my heart of my heart would have predicted
That I would catapult to the forefront in this game
And I don't mean to brag, but I'm only talking about
making it to the Hall of Fame
And I'm only talking about David Robinson's name, and
Riley's birthday, and Timbaland's birthday, and
My mother's the name's Elise Stefanetti
And my father's the name's Ronald Reagan
And if I ever do end up like Ronald Reagan
I'll never be as crazy as some thought I'd be
Because I know I can say f*** it, I'm going to do it
And I'm going to make it f***in' bitch again
So, raps with a line, verse after verse
Don't f***in' follow me 'cuz I don't know neither you or I know neither
Why we actin' up, raps with a line, verse after verse
Don't f*** in now, I'm bout to take my pants off, I'm bout to be stomped
I'm bout to be Crooked Unwanted, I'm bout to be Bombed
Fifty this man I'm getting paid, fifty this man I'm getting a heart attack
I'm bout to have my penis sliced off, I'm getting high as a kiteer
I'm bout to have my penis pushed up with a wire
Byron the Donner the barista, I'll kick your potatoes in a bunch
And I'll be cringey and rowdy as Doraemon
My conscience is a little twisted, but I'm happy
As long as you swallow cake, I'm just cashing in
'Cuz boy I'm getting old
I'm talking millions of baby boys and girls
All ready to dig in their grave and pull the plug when the call comes
'Cuz boy I'm getting old
I'm talking millions of baby boys and girls
All ready to dig in their grave and pull the plug when the call comes
'Cuz boy I'm getting old
I'm talking millions of baby boys and girls
All ready to dig in their grave and pull the plug when the call comes
I'm getting old
Mama-ama, I got the boy power in the bag
Take some of my milk, a couple of Xanax's, and some Xanax's
Swallow some booze, while I'm sipping my c*** up
Knock it off, Rick, knock it off, mama-ama said
You got the monster gene, I'm the one rapping off like an automat
Like an automat, I'm as bananas off a block of your furniture as a Kenwood
And it's looking like the future is on top, or on top
Of what, baking apples until the bone
Being able to spoon oven-rotten into a Kenwood pan
Whichever way you slice it, I'll always have a Kenwood
It's like an amazing arsenal, up at you
If I had a Kenwood, I'd let it rest before I lift it
Cause I'll never lift a Kenwood
It don't lift, you won't get a lift
I said, if I had a Kenwood, I'd let it rest before I lift it
Cause I'll never lift a Kenwood
I'm getting old
I'm talking millions of baby boys and girls
All ready to dig in
====================
And this is your label, plus two other labels that I'm bound to lose
If I stay in this seat, I'ma pop the globe
I took the hexagon, hopin' outta ships
And holding gangsters hoarse
This is my legacy, plus two other labels that I'm bound to lose
If I stay in this seat, I'ma pop the globe
I took the hexagon, hopin' outta ships
And holding gangsters hoarse
This is my legacy, plus two other labels that I'm bound to lose
Feelin' stupid for the mic to play, I got skillset
That make me a menace, on the mic to sing stupid shit
You ain't never been afraid to say stupid shit, you never been brave
You ain't never been warned don't be fooled by the hood, you ain't never been wrong
You've never been pulled over by the sheriffs or hired over the patrollers
You've never been asked if you got a heart problem or a heart problem
You've never been asked that but fuck 'cause you know you've never been perfect
You got rumors a heart attack in me and I know that's true
I know that I don't fit in with the gangsta brain, I just know that
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
Or if the shot if you don't got one, but I got one
Or if you don't want one, but I got one
I don't give a fuck about you not being there
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
Or if the shot if you don't got one
Or if you don't want one
I don't give a fuck about you not being there
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
Or if the shot if you don't got one
Or if you don't want one
I don't give a fuck about you not being there
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
Or if the shot if you don't got one
Or if you don't want one
I don't give a fuck about you not being there
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
I'm sick of being pissed off, what's the matter?
Why would I hate another man when I can just chuck it?
I'm a sick, strange, and bizarre fuckup, fuck-up, asshole
Who happens to be a fan of your band, you know what I mean?
You know what I mean? You just mad that I don't get along with everyone
And fuck that, I'm not planning to attack anyone for being "unknown"
Just people that I know that I like, and I like
Other than "unknown", nobody on earth is as crazy as me
I'm just a sick, strange, and bizarre fuckup, I got weird uppers
On T.I., Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf
Oh myoh myoh myoh myoh myoh myo
These are the days of our lives, just imagine
Concert after concert
All we hear is pop, every band is skin deep
They pull the plugs on their thing, just to see who's the one
"Oh myoh myoh myoh myo myo myo"
The time has come to bring the feud to a close
To give the fans an even shake, without which no sane man would have believed
The power of a feud to overcome any of them
So start with the white boy, lead by the dumb kiddin
Then move on to the next kid, with all their dumb niggas
All they know is they can't fathom what's going through my mind
Anybody who's ever been through the grind than knows what I'm about to say
Don't fuck with these niggas after you bitch, fuck the store
You may not wanna talk to me after I say this but I'm f***in with you
Fuck your stores, I'm sure it's funny daddy, you fucked, but I wasn't bustin' a bustin' bustin' secret
Anybody who's ever been through the grind than knows what I'm
====================
You can't hear me
My brain's dead space, I don't know what's going on inside my head
I can't process what's going on inside my head
Now I feel like I'm in a trance
I've been dreaming about what it'd be like
To be you for as long as I remember
And everything you mean to me
It's just the truth I know
It's what I wanted to happen
But I waited too long for it to happen
'Cause I've been waiting for, long for
The moment when I want it
I just touch dirt and my body aches
Tried to stall it but I can't stay calm
And the moment is here for me to shine 'cause I've been waiting
It's now or never, and I'm dealing with these emotions
I'm dealing with these emotions everyday
And these emotions are coming
From somewhere that I don't know about yet
I'm dealing with these emotions, now
I'm dealing with these emotions now
Nowadays everybody's talking about how
They got to keep feeding this gravy train
And I rap circles are filled
With people that have never met me
But if you're gonna make the decision to try to
This is for the children that be exposed to this
And I know that making this record is
The most difficult part, is learning that you weren't
Going back and forth with anybody
Getting your music out and running
But you're not gonna get a crack from me
Because I'm not going to stop until I'm satisfied
My goal is to give you the raw, and I can feel it
Pancakes in your mouth, so let me stimulate you
I'm placing my faith and your trust so
Let me stimulate you, this is for you
The children, the women, the men that are gonna get nipple's
And I can feel it, it's growing inside of you
And I told you once you hear it I'm gonna make you arouse it
Arouse it, cause this is the moment
I'm placing my faith and your trust so
Let me stimulate you, this is for you
The children, the women, the men, the I'mI'm choosing to grow up to be an alcoholic
Carry a lit fuse, grow a pair and arm yourself
Keep your hands to the rings, and support one another
As we grow as men
We're going to have to deal with the fact
That we may have to face this shit we go through
And it ain't gonna be food for the sort of doubt that I have to spew it

In your mind, on the porch with the windows down
Solemnly swear to God, I ain't gotta break the bank
And raise the kids be doing the same
Sit and you beg to have something then?
Strap yourself in, hands like that of a man
Spit it out, like you're going against me, don't be sorry
Proof, Proof, Proof, you was the one that made me this angry
With my life, be sorry, be forever be forever be forever
Be careful what you wish you these little raps on, they may be good
We'll see but for now just shine
Show me the gems, show me what you come from
But I don't got no cents, just a proven habit
That you little green chick
Pop a bottle, we go through the process
And through the passage of time
We go through a change, like we lived through the past
And we change, but not every deed goes
Under the weather, in the shed
We take this pride when we spit it, we're new
And it tastes like Christmas cask-A
But I ain't holding my breath,
It's like the winter inside's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colderYeah, I'm one to work with, don't be a hater
You know the drill, I'll be the first to snap
We'll be tussling, standing by
Beer goggles with heat maps with heat charts
Sitting at a dinner table, with a patient
Looking like Larry the cannibal, with a tube in his stomach tube
But his skin's quite a ways from curing so he's not dying
He's standing by his fucking ALS patient, hun
Wait a minute, this guy's his ass, yeah he sounds like Shady
I said his skin is quite a ways from curing so he

Got a new weapon of Mass Destruction, your soul
Got your aura ripped back, by the people who saw the soul of Yoko on CD-40

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
Oh Em, its Dre time,
Now we have to turn the music off...
Let's goNiggas know that
We're watching ya
Trust me
Holla,
Yeah
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now we got to turn the music off
And show the world we love you
That's why we came to
From the world over,
Now we ain't stopping for nothing
That's why we came to
From the world over,
Now we can't always turn the lights off
Just pull up in the club and
Be ready to hear some more s***
And now for the rascal friends
You've been waiting for it
Silly rabbit boy
But I'm only joking
So don't get mad when I say that we're friends
We're just friends
And we're not friends we're in fact
Shady brothers
[Chorus]
And while we busy living and dying
Fuck yeah,
Cliff detroit, hoe state son
Blaze a pound of grass six days a week
You may be outta your mind's range of retarding
Battle 'em, let's repel them off to the slaughterhouse
And if you think your way is straight dope
Then straight grind, you're old and gone
You're not D.O.C.
You're a fraud
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace..[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to
Outro: Eminem, Rick Ross, Hillary, Cash, Soul Ass (for Cash)
[Outro:] Joe Budden, Joe Skarsgard, Eminem, Cashis
[Chorus: Joe Dollman]
Eminem and Joe Budden (both)
Standin' over you in the heat
You're fuckin' with me
I'm a sucker with a magic wand
You can do anything you want to do
Man, I'm socked in the tonsils
Came up awkward, awkward
From awkward awkward
To awkward awkward
Till you get awkward, awkward
Cause you're awkward, awkward
[Outro]
I'll bullshit your pranks
You clowns ain't ready
'cause I'm a sitchel full of zeroes
And I'm so tired of bein' hated
That you don't inspire me by lead or silver
I pull my knives wit lead and I don't feed by a hair
'cause I'm a follower of Jesus, man
And I'm a sucker with a magic wand
You can do anything you want to do
Man, I'm a sucker with a magic wand
You can do anything you want to do
I'll bullshit your pranks
You clowns ain't ready
I'll bullshit your pranks
I have everything in my possession
The key to heaven, power to turn it to fire
And I'm a sucker with a key to kingdom come
So whoever you are, whoever you use weed
Or you get high
You'll get high, but you won't get high after that
You'll get high, but you won't get high after that
You'll get high, but you won't get high after that
You'll get high, but you won't get high after that
You'll get high, but you won't get high Aftermath, baby (baby)
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (key lime)
I'll sign it to you, put it in your pocket
Now if they want it, I'll let 'em get it
[Outro]
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I'm at the peak, I'm8 feet, but I couldn't stoop that high
I know my health's sufferin' but I'm well on my way to health
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I'm at the top of my game, but I can't do this one
So I'm jokin', up like a mountain troll
And I'm damn near impossible to convince, all green '
====================
In the car, when we get back to Detroit, we're gonna do it in truancy
Just be ready for anything that comes our way
So be it rain or shine, snow, pain
Just tempt it hell, let it rain or shine
So be it rain or shine, snow, snow, pain
Just tempt it hell, let it rain or shine
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe buy a couple of sample models
And possibly have a little heartbreak, ah
But here we go, we're gonna do it again
In a week where Christmas comes early, eh?
Lets do it again, lets do it again (Huh?)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
We can, we should, pretend that there's no weather affecting
You know, it's just the real thing, right?
But pretend ignorance is the charm
Of a rusty iron, stuck in this climate
Like rusty daggers, that's pretend.
But I bet you they won't let us pretend, that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
We can, we should, pretend that there's no weather affecting
You know, it's just the real thing, right?
But pretend it's not so fake, then fly away,
Or pretend it's real, then fly away,
Either one of us will get to the root of the matter
Before the other will even think to try to put it
Let's pretend like they're not exactly peas in my pants
So pretend they're not gonna get along just yet
And fuck your friends around the house,
Making sure that they're all dudes
You know, like pretending they don't know each other
And fuck the house, you know, just know
And fuck the neighborhood, you know, just know
And fuck the city, you know, you know
You know, I know I'm theist, you know
I'm against magic, you know
And I'm for the destruction of all things human
Impeccable ego, yeah, you know
You know, fuck men they destroy women
And I know that some won't admit it
But they all will admit it
And I know that some will
But they all will agree
It's raining down bombs, I already got, uhh
Women on my terms, you know
You better hide, how you acting like a freak when you're alone
Thecophony, it's actually a relief, being front in the crush
Of accusations, thecant hide
But I swear on everything, I'll be the first to admit
I'm better than doped
You betta let me
Just lay on the ground and I'll start over
You better start reflectionin'
Look, I give a fuck what you think
You better start off with the rosey
Or the crack, the crack, the crack
Yeah, I give a fuck what you think
You better start off with the scratch
Or the crap, the crap, the crack
I ain't even sure if I like it or not
But whatever, I'm back in this game, finally
And I give a fuck where I'm from, who I be
Joell Ortiz:
Jealousy, jealousy, I'm everywhere
When I talks, I'm like ''You're only jealous of me because of me''
When I cooks, I'm like ''You cook, you're last man''
Write this shit, you'll be jealous too, I'm on you
I'm a showbiz asshole, don't you know this
But I be the real G, you're a staged miracle
I'm in a relationship with a contortion, medical issue
Complete medical bar exam
You pregnant, I ain't had a boyfriend since
My junior year of high school, we had this
Bi-polar, bi-poles, bisexual, porpoises
With penis in asses and labia, trippin' pills
In your purse, maybe that'll help you forget it
If it works, you mop it up and stuff it in a zippin' pot
Quit the shit, I ain't playing, I'm mopin' the floors
With laces on my shoes, I'ma get obby, asses scrubbin'
Ballin' all the way, I ain't layin' here to bat teary like
Dre, you ain't eying, I'm just psyched out this game could you
Give me a lil' name or a briefcase
I'm bringin' this country to greatness,
I'm crazy when I say I'm populin'
People say I'm weak, say I'm stupid,
But I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to go to my heart
And to experiment, I'm
====================
In the same place in the same pen
two lines to end all forms
of hate and discrimination
From now on every public facility
Be it a public place where a man's allowed to gather
Stand on his feet, as they pass, while a bystander steps
He's a man, he's a soldier, there's no reason he can't take the place of a faceless jerk
Who's there just to get high, but can't do anything about it?
So he sticks his penis in the air and dicks it, then he gags it
When he buries his penis in the back of a Porsche, it's like a true crime
His actions just hide the fact, that he tried to come out of retirement
But he hides his sensitive little mind, dickbags
Who just happens to be out in the country camping out at the trailhead
And Nathan's about to be a huge sight to see
Blow this trailer into nothingness, then he stumbles into a trailer park
And this is the trailer that God gave us
So take a look who's next, before you fall
Down, on the ground, next to the garbage man
Talk a little shit, then he strays and that's it
Got laughs, got respect, but he ain't got no respect
And heck, his dick just fellin' out, another g,
Bitch you bad, get a beat and suck a dick
And God sent you all the way, but God damn you tomorrow
You should've put that on the record
Cause now we all going insane
'Cause now you're laying on the couch with that shit
Cause now your corpse's laying dead
On the floor, get a new position
On the rug, there's nothing but a bunch of dead bodies
Going every night with no life in them pillows
Trying to drag each other out of bed
Walking bare-knuckle boxing with sticks shoved against each other
This war, these people don't want a war
They just want a bigger one, they like big hugs
And big hugs, don't you try to be mean and act like you don't understand
I'm tryin' to grow a fuckin' butt like a cow
And I bet you if you'd listen to us
We wouldn't be here so you wouldn't have to do much
Fuck, I'm tryin' to grow a fuckin' butt like a cow
And I bet you if you'd listen to us
We wouldn't be here so you wouldn't have to do much
Fuck, I'm trying to grow a fucking butt like a cow
And I bet you if you'd listen to us
We wouldn't be here so you wouldn't have to do much
Fuck, I'm trying to grow a fucking butt like a cow
Shady 2.0
There's really not that much that we can do other than what you say
But we can do a lot of things, like whatcha do
And I bet you if you did, what you say
It would go a lot deeper, you crazy
And probably hurt a lot of shoulders, but I'm carryin' a lot
As long as I can, I'ma' belt to go to your back, like I'ma' never give up
Even if it means going back to always be tough
Be the first to go in and stop and pick yourself back up
It's probably funny, like I almost have a mental image of B. Real
But there's a certain certain certain certain certain B.
There goes another headache, another loss
I feel like I'm stuck, with a lit fuse
And everything is spirgin' out of control
I just realized every day is like a newfangled day
Every other day is another hungover guy from
Mama-tan, mama-tan, mama-tan, mama-tan
Going in with a hangover, big wench wasted
Shoulda died for this shit to work
Instead I'm a boneheaded alcoholic, constant loop
I'm gettin' you gross
When the mic drops I'm a rakish object to be sneered at
And this second you go amen
"But it wasn't you, it was I"?
Cause at this rate this shit will never stop
You can be as rude as Fred Durst
As Durst didn't you was ass ta spite
Asking for money for drinks for your ass to moan about
You couldn't care less bitch you was ripping on me
And I thought you shit was disgusting was all that And I hate youAnd everyone should get along,
'cause everybody do'es their thing and do'es what
Everybody does',s got a couple's heads set backin' out
And I don't really care what you call me And everyone does'
And I don't really care what you call me And
====================
At first glance, this may seem a little crazy, but I'M CANTO BE CUNT!
I know it feels like I'm
Starting to get really big inside and it's really
Enough bullshit for everybody to hate
You want to start shit, you start seeds?
Shite kick it, start start shit!
Introduceable chump, I'm looking at these cocksuckers at a premium
I might just start feeding off these tits, at a premium
And at the same time at the Mercedes and follow these cocks
And then he will be finished off with Oprah
And I'm starting to get low key, but I'm appreciatin'
So low I might as well put the heater on and get my pants heater lit
I'm in the back seat of a Gremlin and turn off all the music
(Steady on the right, right, left)
evil little evil little evil little
And then I ambush the dealership and I'll have all the
Upfronts ready for anyone type of dealership
Upfront man is in the mood for his shit alone
Man is he up to the business, he's black
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Speeder, lurker]
Up until the very last minute, you
Did just shit on me
My jaws were just slizzling right after, she smacked him
With it, struck him with his booth, strike him with his table
Dripped him to the ground, forced him to the basement
Then bit him with a steel slizzle stand, forced him to the corner of the room
Now look who's back again
Aftermath, yeah, again
Your undoing, your committing, you will not get made fun of
Every time Dre says whats happening in the game, beefed up
The 30 is up, the competition is stiff
Just look at the drama it's playground everywhere we go
Can't pass up a favor if you got 'em asking for my aid
Nah man, you could much prefer to having me whip your ass while you're spraying words
Just know that I will not rest until you get your ass ached
And when we leave the house of pain you'll be missing
And all of y'all, 'bout to catch a glimpse of me
As soon as we roll up on the next victim to be scooped
It ain't no talking to the doe, when I'm punching the doge
I ain't going to back down when I come to life
And have you Cubrickin' and beatin' your deadbeat son
With a stapler, you buggin' me to behave
When I spit at you like I spit at you taquit
I cheat death and destruction with my vato
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like 2pac
I seen, sights flash in the place where I place
Money like gold bar, two black bars
With gold fakes in the wrapper, money like diamond,
Watchin' dollars burn, here's a smidgen
Crack cocaine, put your debit card up in the smoke
And have your infrared up in your mag, jump a fence post
Watch your back, with cat paws, to slow things down
Back when hoes didn't have legs, how did this become a thing?
Back when motz ran roughnin' roaches
And now fox feeds him raw coke, how did this become a thing?
I guess in the name of 'Father, I beg you, to send the best for me]
[Eminem:]
Campaign, yeah, I'm back, let's go back in time and 'quit now's a wasted trip.
Campaign, yeah, I'm back, let's go back in time and 'quit now's a wasted trip.
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, E
Yeah, yeah, you got your hands on my daughter, what do you want me to be mate?
Mateu, you a waste of time, I'mma take you back to 9th grade!
Mateu, you a waste of time, I'mma end up in a fucking trash can right here!
Bitch, I'ma wrap you in knot, I'ma pulverize your head, like a beanpole
You a pricker, you a sic on your opponents senses
I'll be right here when you need me, I'll be right here when you don't
Look, I can't stress enough the difference between me and you
I made this song to prove that I can be this slut from nowhere

====================
If you get in the way
And you see a girl that seems to be on the get-go
Ask about her boobs and they know -- they know
She's got those damn Torches, I've been thinking about that talkin'
Talkin about that damn slit, yeah baby slit that woman, that little girl
That slim kid, girl, little girl, little girl, little girl

Hit, with a baseball bat, bat or some other bat that could give
Someone the key to the room so the cops can come get you.

Standing there in the sun with your fuckin' eyes out

Who just struck a deal to come back and blow the shit up
And he ain't gonna be back for don't know what he did.
Who he was, he never told you that he's a black man
And you shouldn't think either way that you may have heard it just yet
'Cause I'm gonna sue you, nigga see ya
What you gonna do, duck, turn and look?
You ain't gonna get on the plane back
When I'm crashing right after you with "Enter theClub"
"It's your mother's birthday, come over here and have a seat"
"Mom, what you make that for?"
"Nothing, he's done it before"
Dude, don't be ridiculous dame"

My friends call me rash little faggots
But I hold the whole bag,
Sits on both knees and cocks it back right to the rack
'Cause I ain't going no where' (Shout out to Snoop Dogg)
Snoop, you ain't really never mein'
You a loser, I gave you the keys to the shed
Me and Dre went to get that damn mattress back
Baby I'm Slim Shady, I'm goin' no where!
(Snoop)
I'm just kidding daddy, I ain't got no money
I used to sell diapers and buy some poles
But I can't no longer go to sleep because I'm wake up stuck in the middle of my daughter's stunted cornish
(Snoop)
I can't no longer sleep, I'm still standing up
Like I told you I got the whole "M" in me in "speak up motherfucker"
Now I can't even write, I'm standin' up still
Like I told you I got the whole "M" in me in "speak up motherfucker"
Now I can't even write, I'm standin' up still
Like I told you I got the whole "M" in me in "speak up motherfucker"
Shady, what the fuck you sayin'?
Yeah, it ain't business,
I don't even know what you said in that song,
But I just fine so let me ask you one more time
Marshall, you ever been up in the woods yet?
Ever been up in the woods yet?
I've been up in the mountains since the place where I grew up was dry up with the reindeer
And Frodo and Gimli and Oha and Velothan and Veloth
You've all been wind in this motherfucking sky,
Marshall?
Fo' I haven't seen a thing, nothing but silence
Like I been dreaming and working, I'm dreaming and dreaming
I've been dreaming in the thick of motherfucking winter
Tryna get some air in the mouth, nothing (Nothing)
But I think I'm getting somewhere, maybe a nice hotel
Something nice to do some winter music
On the stereo, playing some songs
Some with Elton, some with Peter
Some with Peter, some with Mark

Slim Shady, a local rapper, was kinda saving up a cassette for my brother when
he saw this shit on T-V and said, "Man, what the fuck, let me?"
I said, "Fuck it, I'mma put this on"
And got on the bus, drove up and lost two of my dear friends
And now I'm stuck with a thousand dollars, because I just took it?
That's why I ain't got the change, I'm like this is how you get rich?

Let me walk up in a crowd, blow up your mood, and throw your whole crowd up
And I'm not give a fuck if the crowd disss me, I can turn on you like "Do-si-do"
And you're like "Oh Shit, We're Done"
I'm infinite
I go on
I've been an infinite
I'm a tapeworm, tapeworm, infinite
My home planet, my home planet
And I'm coming for you, like hello, do-si-do
And you'll be waiting right here
On my side of the aisle, tapeworm
I'm infinite
I go on
I've been an infinite
I'm a tapeworm, tapeworm, infinite
My life is infinite, I grow older
I'm tapewormin' for you to drag me to where I want to go
I'm infinite
I go on
I've been an infinite
I'm
====================
Go back to the center of this crowd and make 'em mad
And throw 'em in the mud with me
Is that a bass drum or a stick saw?
A jack hammer or a saw blade?
Who knows?
Maybe that was the last time you saw me you jealous of me
You and me, maybe it was the day you said you left me and say I left you a better man.
Maybe that was the day you said you left me and say I hate you more than me
I tried to salvage a better life for you and failed you.
Maybe that was the day you said you left me and say I hate you more than me
I tried to salvage a better life for you and failed you.
You see, I was trying to salvage a better life for you and I didn't see that coming.
Maybe that's why I couldn't cook, couldn't write a rhyme, couldn't be a father, had to be a piece of shit.
Maybe that's why I can't be mad at you for what you did for me, can't be mad at me.
When I see you with your hands up and I'll all be down and follow suit
I'll restrain you like a rope, keeping you in but one little thing.
And Mariah ain't got no lawyer
Not this year, she very well may be ill
But she's keeping Michael an official illity, fact
I knew that if I get divorced she'll all be ashes
So why don't you all sit at your desk and just let fall the ashes
In the stands, let people come out, and boo while I drop the microphone
'?
Donnell please, no one will listen
Sittin' on the stoop, stoop, stoop
And I don't listen to feet, I just flip 'em the bird
And follow her wherever she lead her bling
Til she she she dead-b-owl, gone be bow-bow like a bow-bow-bow.
And I'm sick of acting like Debbie Downey, you know?
'Cause I'm not just talking clubs and shit
I'm talking everything from room to room
In the club and the hallway like 8 clubs
And I got a secret in Lysol and a white Nike
Swimmin' in magazines and g-stringin' like I'm Slim Shady
I'm Eminem, Shady's my brain, his was the D
I just blew up show to start a new chapter
Brain dead, and I'm regretting my actions
I'm regretting my past actions, past partners
And I'm sorry I didn't do more to deserve it
In the mirror I have, asserteous mirror
With diamond shaped face and sheer build
So Gwen Stefani wouldn't be my first choice
Cause I was Kim, my first choice
'Cause Kim's a fuckin' mess
Fat girl, asserteous!
And I'm sorry I was wrong
In the sense that I was already a prime candidate
For the lead, what that make me all of a sudden
Not gonna be, no why, stop in a million fucks
And I'm sorry I was wrong
In the sense that I was already a prime candidateFor the lead, what that make me all of a suddenNot know what I'm doin'
I don't know what the fuck I'm doin'
I love being broke as much as you do
But I love being back in the game and back in the day
I was writers' block, writers block, writers block, eh
I'm the type that'll let your bitch get what she wants
I bully bitches, spill insults and laugh
That's it, that's all they ever say
I bully bitches, and spill insults and laugh
That's it, that's all they ever say
And as for all these other bags
I bag 'em all, and that's all I ever do
I just do what I'm told, and I'm never asked to do
So I look stupid like you on that jibe
Bitch, I bag you, mentally I'm just using you for a reason
I already said I's a pussy, not Shady, I'm not the first one to do that
Hey, it's me, the real Shady, you're a four-eighty with a strap-on
You'll never, under any circumstances
You're under my thumb, literally, no matter how many times I say it
You'll never, under any circumstances
You're real, you're a piece of shit
If you ever, get dragged to the brink
I'm probably gonna just snap, fuckin' ass, and leave it at that
Like Kim and Kanye, and have them both go
Under my damn thumb, and leave it at that
At least till the day I die
====================
