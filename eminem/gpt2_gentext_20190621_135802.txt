And I'mma hold on long enough
I'm bout to turn this thing into a track
I'll show you what love is like
Just one more time
And come back again
And save the day
And bounce even more than usual
Just like my mom did when she tried to hold me down
Be proud to say I blew up when I told her
'Cause I helped pave the way for people who don't know me
To see that I'm still the same guy
But I'm changing my mind up 'cause
Sometimes I just feel like I'm stuck in my ass,
How am I gonna get over this hump?
Can't I just get over this hump?
Just hit me back, sit back, write this bitch
Writing this letter, I'm at a loss for words
Damn, I'm on so many's
Just the concept is too cool
I'm so lost without 'em
Em
What is love?
Love is a virus
You bite it and live with it
It's your life
You can live without it
But you'll never live up to it
So you better wake the birds
And lay down the eggs
While I'm still breathing so I can lay the eggs
So quit playing with the honey
I'm done with this game
I'm done with this bitch
I swear I love this game
I never stopped playing
I'm still here
I'm free
All I need is the beat to rap
I keep makin' these little kids mad
And I'm mad enough to lay bricks
With neighbors and law enforcement
I'm mad enough to throw fits
Getting older and older
More and more black
And it gets worse from here
Haskell's on my plate
Is there anyone that I can talk to
Gets like Raymond James
Does he spit? No, he just
Has straight blood? No, he just
Shoots himself in the fucking face with a rifle
(HE'S EMINEM!!!!!) It's Mr. Big
That pissed off in his late fags, didn't he
That somebody fixated on the little kid
That I barely scratched the surface
That got swallowed whole
I'm sick of all this self loathing I get
From all these different angles
Can't change the fact that I'm a
Face full of red balls
And this is the only clear mirror
Of my true self
But I'm self hating
Cause I'm hating
I can't eat, sleep or call
And my medication is making me doubt my own strength
And my strength
And my medication
Cough up a lungful every time I take a pill
But this time, I'm just dispensing enough
Yeah, Mr. Big
Take my hand, and go take this Cheech
Take my hand, and go take this Cheech
(Obie Trice take my hand)Yo
This one's for you and me
And if you don't like it, you can't go out
You can go in your own skin
And be yourself
You can go Cheech
You can get in here
I'm just trying to encourage you
To go out there and show them that you love them little niggas
And if you don't like it, you can't go out
You can go in your own skin
And be yourself
[Lloyd banks]
I got a new fag album coming
I'm married to this bitch
I pay her a visit
Lookin' over every baby's show
Stole the mic from her
Carried her whole ass
Knocked her down
Beat the shit out 'em
Beat the fuck out of 'em
[Eminem]
You want lyrics to be free?
Yea
You can hook up with rappers that take lyrics
Long as you're white
Hook up in a
White whorehouse
With all the drama
Christmas wreck
Between the twins
Living in a trailer
And my fuckin' homie is jealous
But y'all better hate me
Or find me a whore
And flaunt my wealth
You better come to my trailer
And let me suck your dick with one hand and
Paint your other with the wordless word
You better come to my trailer
And let me suck your dick with one hand
And shit your wank ass
[Proof]
Few are as sick as Weisman's,
who supply the HIV
Patients come from all over the world
Sworn to come here sick and heavy
Though I'm in the RV park, the sick ain't
Coming from my country
Or come straight from giving a fuck
Give a fuck what you think
Or make it rain or shineGive a fuck what you wish you had
Come back when you're sick and you need it
When your been in the lab so sick,
Here's
====================
My momma's coochie,
She used to tell me the line was long enough to bust my head in half
And then she would go to the mall and pick up the branch and spray
it on the way home, a ho tied it with rope and tape
And a mean wiener t-shirt with a cross stitching on it
Wife beaters and a hundred and ten decals
My little sister used to make hoopla in the bleachers,
By pouring hot glue through her eyes
To put out the candles and make the night come to life
My brother would watch and would try to get his tuna ole sauce
Until his titties started turning and he started turning
Walking barefoot and barefoot spittin'
And knees started bent and knees were bent
I think my momma got her wish when
I went to get it, I think I got it
I don't think my momma got to hear me
Sayin' her word 'cause my brother's mad
I think my momma got it too
At the time my brother was only in fifth grade
My mother was screaming "Get him off of this'
I don't understand what her doing
Why can't I please my Lord be merciful and forgive my father
'Cause this is my fault
I don't understand why she's mad
I don't know why she's so mean
I gotta take it 'cause I'm not trying to be merciful
I'm tryin' to understand
What my momma's tryin' to say
'Cause I know that I won't be able to pull it
It's like she's super lazy see
All these other rappers gettin' laid I don't see how this
Can't be good, it must be bad
Can't be that bad
Hook:
My momma's tryin' to get rid of me (uh-uh)
She's anti-Tip her damn, she's anti-Tip
My father's a big fan of y'all, uh-uh
And I don't think her just means 'em little good jokes
Don't think she's tryin' to grandstand
Oh yeah she's really got some nice things to say
She's got a new album out, and I hope it's not a Jay-Z-centered
Rappers who just can't keep it super-smooth
Like Makaveli, keep it real, yeah
and Ja Rule too, he knows what she mean
She's one of them big cats, she rules like a champ
And I hope that she keeps tryin' to rap for me
It's super confusing, I'm crazy with this
I've been tryin' to get my shit, done and shit
evened out, and it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
I've been tryin' to get my shit, finished
evened out, and it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
I've been sick of being broke, I've been sick of being broke
I've been told every time I go to rap, I'm signin'
And that's when you can't sign me, when you feel like you got a problem
And you feel like you gotta, uh, make a change and maybe
You don't like it, but you can still sign me
And I appreciate every minute, because I appreciate every minute
It's been a ride, ain't it? I've been paid, I've been paid
I been told every time I go to rap, I'm signin'
And I feel like I'm goin' psychotic
I've been sick of being broke, I've been sick of being broke
I've been told every time I go to rap, I'm signin'
I'm an asshole, bitch, I'm signin' Jay-Z
Fuck my flow, fuck my shit, I'm sick of all this
Homie, this is the only shit that I'm dissin'
And I'm coming to get my dick sucked out
By a dick sucker, cock! Fuck you!
P-p-p-piston monologue, phat preview
Probably say the f-cking one from Fifty years ago
When I first started this shit
Wouldnt it be great if you gave
You the finger, I wouldattach it, so you know
Who's the one you want to lose
Pedal to the metal, patient torture
A painful reminder of where I'm at
Practicing as a pro, I hope you don't question
My hand is in the deck, pat on the back
Here I go again, it's past you all
Shady aftermath, aftermath, aftermath
It's nothing, it's not happening
It's too late for the other side
They're in the car, quick as I get to the gas
====================
It's like a nightmare, it's comical
But the things I dream about, is,
Rhyming in my drink, I drip in my medicine cup
But you won't make sense to me
Unless you're Hannibal
The twisted side of me Hannibal
Hannibal was always going Hannibal
And you couldn't see the twisted side of me
I always felt bad for Hannibal
He was always going Hannibal
I had this bad boy look inside my dreams
And I knew it was going to be rough
And I knew I had a bad boy look inside my dreams
But it wasn't going to be easy
I had to deal with this bad boy inside
And that's when my bad boy look in my dreams
It was like a nightmare, it's comical
But the things I dream about, is,
Rhyming in my drink, I drip in my drink
But you won't make sense to me
Unless you're Hannibal
The twisted side of me Hannibal
I had this bad boy look inside my dreams
And I knew it was going to be rough
And I knew I had a bad boy look inside my dreams
But it wasn't going to be easy

And that's when my bad boy look in my dreams
It was like a nightmare, it's comical
But the things I dream about, is,
Rhyming in my drink, I drip in my drinkI ain't gonna lie, I'm just so fucking excited to get this done.

Thanks for stopping by
I love it
Y'all like my music
It helps when I hear my songs
I get to hang with the best
People from out south
Coming together to celebrate our 50th anniversary
Yeah, it's a pleasure
Straight out the gate we're goin'
It's been one hell of a ride
Yeah, haha

Cause, I want to see if you can swallow a fucking mouthful
Cause I want to see if you can spit a fucking word
Cause I want to see if you can suck a fucking nipple
Cause I want to see if you can swallow a fucking mouthful
I'm not a doctor, I'm a fucking statistician
A fucking statistician, yeah, I'm biased
A little bit, I think I'll spit a fucking word out this coin
And put it in your bank account
And have you sitting by the time you see?
I'm curious, are you paid
And given the time you must be spending
Inhumane, inhumane, inhumane
Inhumane, inhumane
I see you taking pictures of me
Sitting by the blood, watching the streets
Just as a policeman waits for you
Ain't no one here to see that I'm happy
They call me Viceroyal, I'm a soldier too
A soldier, because I'm a soldier, it's time for me
To serve, not follow, rules of the trade
I think I understand the mentality here
Ain't no one here to see that I'm happy
They call me Viceroyal, I'm a soldier too
A soldier, because I'm a soldier, it's time for me
To serve, not follow, rules of the trade
I think I understand the mentality here
Now, I'm not going to pretend to know you
You don't see me as much as you think I do
But I do know that I love you
And I think we have a pretty good bond
I think you probably think I'm trying to hold you against me
Well, that's nonsense of course
First off we don't know each other's name
You know what I do when I do
I just do
I do it
It's not a contest
It's a living, breathing thing
If you respond or not
I'm just happy to be outed as the one who murdered your mother
And put you in the position to see
What it's like to be white at the dedication
And it's like being White Jack, Kenny
While I blaze a cigarette at the bar
I think I'm smoking a lighter
than Peablo Scevi when he injects you
With the syringes that make up the plaque
That the bastard was 'bout to grace the bill
It's a game that I play
I think I'll put on for sure
Shit, is him all doomed
He's still trying to get over to me
So be proud, be proud
He's grown, grown
Laughing, laughing, laughing
I think he's quite aware that we're human
He's grown, grown, grown
He's an animal, growin' a dick
He's frightened of me, he's grown, grown, grew
He's frightened of me, he's grown, grown, grew
Fuck it, he's coming to see me dog
I'll show you fuck the world
I'll shove you a horse through your shins
And shove you right through to the wind
So be proud, be proud
He's grown, grown, grown
Laughing, laughing, laughing
I think he's quite aware that we're human
He's grown, grown, grown
He's an animal, growin' a dick
He's frightened of me, he's grown, grown, grew
He's afraid of me, he's grown, grown, grew
Oh shit, he's growin', he's grown
Oh shit, he's coming to see me dog
I'll show you fuck the world

Up in this raw state, a sinner's sanctum, always on the hunt for a way out, but never out
But out, I don't turned back no more, and that s***, I'm out
So every last word that I have, I have been replaced with this blacker and this white ain't rhyming
But these last few words, have made me scream
And I'll never forget them
I'm going to walk through that wall, never leaving the mural
And I'm not going to leave to the fact that I love my hood
Cause when I'm passed out on the first trimester ultrasound
I'm going to inject this drug, and this is what the scare looks like
'Cause these last few words, have made me scream

The buzz is tremendous now that Andre has entered the game
I'm in the booth conversing with Andre
Conversation is everything
Andre is on the mic
Andre is talking all the time
I just keep hearing the same things
My head is fogging up
My confidence is up
My days of being on the underdog has been wiped

I'm finally able to step up to the front
And talk to these fantastic people
From Andre and Andre's to Andre's
And Andre's name is on the wall
With a baseball inlay
And Andre's hat's on the floor

No, not again
Just because
Oh, I'm so sorry mommy
I just think I'm over exaggerating

====================
It's like a nightmare, it's comin' to you
You screamin' and screamin' and oh
I don't wanna go another round, I'm ill
So on the radio every night when Dre's comin
And y'all mothafuckers say, "Oh, it's Dre!"
Well, you ain't dope, you ain't kush
You kurt spurt or spurt your feet
It's Dre!
So, how do I find him?
I started on the radio, I sold out tour
Then the tour ended and I was gone
I couldn't sell a single album when JÃ¤ger died
¢¤iÃ¤ngers I got to wait
And pray every single night when Dre's comin
And y'all mothafuckers say, "Oh, it's Dre!"
Well, you ain't dope, you ain't kush
You kurt spurt or spurt your feet
It's Dre!

I couldn't sell a CD when JÃ¤ger died
It was too late to start over
So, how do I find him?

Yo, I'm so excited, I feel like I'm going insane
I can't believe it, I just got signed to E! and I'm Raekwon
All I'm feeling is tremendous energy
All I want to do is relax and unwind
I'm so excited, I feel like I'm going insane
I can't wait to throw this party and have it
over and forget
What happened on the way back
Me and Dre were running errands in the area
Could have stopped at a sign
But instead we went over the edge
Started flipping burgers and veg out the back
Went from Long Beach to the Red & Gold
Didn't know it was SoHo

But Dre was gone
I almost passed out
I was dancing with friends
Fondly embraced
But then I realized
I was crazy
Guess it was just the two of us
But guess who's back
 (Kuniva)
Oh (Interlude)
I feel like, stumped
Started goosing
Searching
====================
I don't know why they do this
I don't know how they do it
I don't know if it's psychological or spiritual
It's like they just don't understand the fact
That they can't escape their own roof
It's like they got a plan B
And it's just not happening
[Chorus]

Yo,
I'm going to kill this bitch with a scalpel
I'm ready for combat
I'm like Master P, I'm a Man with Two Fingers
I Shot Jessica Alba, so what?
Ready to shoot at somebody, armed with a pencil
Who's got a Mac-10s? It's like shooting a nuclear missile launch
From an altitude of six feet below
You can reach them, reach them,
And I ain't going to let you down
I'm a man of my word, so you can expect a rude awakening
When I talk, I'm a man of my word
'Cause when I speak
I'm a man of my word
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm going to kill this bitch with a scalpel
I'm ready for combat
I'm like Master P, I'm a Man with Two Fingers
I Holla'ed Jessica Alba, hopped on a dick and a tube of lube
Went in and out of town
Wasn't doing my body like a circus animal
It was bound to get me in a fight
Probably wouldn't anyway
Been real enough to cause Sarah Palin an abortion
Why am I such a sick pig
Am I attracted to the strangulation of Monica
Baby girl, you're such a dick
I put a scalpel in Christina's mouth
Knock her down, punch her in the stomach
And push her until she knocked herself unconscious
(I'm going to kill you)
I'm a man of my word, so you can expect a rude awakening
When I talk, I'm a man of my word
'Cause when I talk
I'm a man of my word
(Speaking in a low voice)
I'm a dude, so you can expect a rude awakening
When I talk, I'm a man of my word
(Speaking in a low voice)

I'm comin' back, with a vengeance, with a brand new album
I rewind every time I write so you can see why I'm poppin'
And rap lyrics I'm reppin'
My motor city is no good,
I'm sick of all this beefin' and I'm comin' back
With a vengeance, with a brand new album
I rewind every time I I write so you can see why I'm poppin'
And rap lyrics I'm reppin'
It's your mother fucking life that you fucking hate
That's why I'm sick of all you
And I got a new nigga for you to hate
That's right, B.I.G. G-I-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-NIGG!
And I got you feelin' a lot of self-hatred
From the first you bit,
Then I let you try everything
Everything was just counting
Then it got to the last minute
I think I just...I don't know
I just feel like I'm surrounded by so much hatred
I just can't breathe!
And it's getting late
So I'm always late
I guess this will just make me feel

I'm on the clock
Rising up from the ashes
I'm a clock ticking
It's 2 am, I'm in the middle of speaking
I want to talk
Excuse the music
Time to introduce you
To the face of the business
I wanna start with you
You're the wrong type of...
I wanna start with you
You're the wrong type of...
To start with
I'm coming to kill you
For you
And for you
And for you
And...and for you
I'm coming at you with a vengeance
No words at first, just a stare that says
No count, no words at first
Just a stare that says
No count, no words at first
I'm coming at you with a vengeance
No words at first, just a stare that says
No count, no words at first
Just a stare that says
No count, no words at first

Song: I love you
Verse:
I just come to kick your ass at your own game
And to wake your competitor up
Jumped out to dinner with files
And made the dinner-breakfast sandwich
And center-fasted the challenger for the same reason
I'm coming to kick your ass at your own game
Cause when I think of you
I'mma kick your ass at your own game
[Album]
No pun intended
'Til supper time
When the tension is under control
To kick it back to the ways of me and you
I'mma be intense and deadly with this rap
Before I end up in jail
Can't lock you up, can't keep you
You're in this together
Because you're not gonna fight, then you're gonna
Die, so to speak, when you come to fight me
I came to save these young mothers
From going without without
You coming to see
How these weak and hollowed-out minds
Are
Cause of this music, and our current political climate
It's hard to relax when
You're feeling nostalgic
When you came to this earth
For this game
To be through
It's like a journey
You coming with lyrics
And lyrics to wrap your mind around
And we're gonna make this again
We're gonna make this again
You coming with lyrics
And lyrics to wrap your mind around
And we're gonna make this again
We're gonna make this again
Pickets of yellow fever
Lightning strikes again
I think I'ma lose my keys
Everything I should be up in
I'm like a head trip with the wind
I could be the head of this crew
It's like a twist on a string
I think I'ma lose my keys
Everything I should be up in
I'm like a head trip with the wind
I could be the head of this crew
[Artist name]
I start
====================
You wanna be friends?
You'll never think of us, let alone eat, sleep, or be nude
We're laughing all the time, and we're always smiling
I smile all the time, and I eat, sleep, and be nude
See, things have changed in the game, like they used to when I was the ganja
But I can't change the way I feel about you
I still feel sad that I lost my virginity to you
'Cause while I'm on the subject,
I'm also sorry I didn't tell you
I still feel sad that I didn't
Tell you
I guess it's okay for you
To hate the game
You can hate the sport
You can always go and just
Go and just

Lyrical
I give the world of mine
A little bit of myself
And indulge in some R&B
I write the sort of poetry that gets the crowd pumped
And full of it, pride on you
You're poetry is filled with a
Fill a can, it's empty without it
So bow down, and God is my salvation
From all pain, all hatred, all jealousy
I release from my grip
The shackles I've been dealt, I'ma hold onto this today
Just so I don't repeat them
Motherfuckin' West, fuck the present
Fuck the past, fuck the adolescent
I'ma hold onto this today
Just so I don't repeat them
Motherfuck lil' boys, this is the history
And you better fucking understand
Boy I'm a mean, boy I'mma fuck the mariah
Boy I'm a mean, boy boy boy
I'm a drain boy, boy I'mma fuck the girl

Hilary Duff once said
====================
See what I do in my brain do
Ain't nothing new to me
It's been going on here for a long time
My name is Marshall Mathers
Dre told me to call you, to tell you
What I think of you
What I respect the most Marshall
I guess that if I hear back
I will have no choice but to raise hell
Raising hell I will either
Raise hell or hang up
I'll be praying for answers
I'm locked in a cage
So I'm breathing
No one seems to know it's a cycle
Raising hell I'm holding my nose
I'm going to die raising hell
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my mind
That I'm going insane
I think I'm losing my temper
Holland wont even speak when I slap his dick
Holland wont even take my tongue
And put on my Tasco de Mayo
And wear a Karl Kani
And take a shit on the Pepsi
It's a double victory
And I think my medication is working
I'm finally putting an end to the madness
I think I'm starting to lose my temper
I think my medication is working
I'm finally putting an end to the madness
Raising hell I'm holding my nose
I'm going to die raising hell
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my mind
That I'm going insane
I think I'm losing my patience
I think my meds are taking me way too far
I think I'm going insane
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hell I'm holding my nose
I'm going to die raising hell
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my mind
That I'm going insane
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hellI think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hell
I think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Raising hell
I think it's been going on long enough
I think I'm losing my patience
Yeah, ho
What happened, Marshall?
Ha ha, what happened to be, coming through?
Yeah, came out, came in, new school, h.o.d
Hittin' on the next level, ain't nothing new to me
Hittin' on top, hoe-ha ha, I got a new nigga named B.i.
New school nigga, hoe-ha ha ha, that's great
Nothing new to me, that's what I came up wit, ho
Hittin' on top, came out of nowhere
Bout to rip his own chest like Cheddar Bobs
I don't even know what's new, it's old school, hoe
Raising hell, I think I'm going insane

Inside it, funky as can be
It goes one on one, we bust out of it
We bust out of our pen, scribble in it
It's always going it's we say
When you bust it you can't do
What you doing the beat should be the beat
The beat should be our pen
Pen in our notebook, scribble in
====================
You can't see me
I'm hiding behind the safe
I'm on a quest to make it through school
Without a clue what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing
I just want to shake the whole world
And get to know all the beautiful women who got it goin
I had a dream girl, who I mistook for a friend
Who was always pushin' me to the brink
Even though I was soon to be broke as a child
I remember tryna shake her head in that state
I was goin' through on my way to get through
I'd go in the door and the doorbell ring
But I guess I just ignored it
I was tellin' Hollywood not to push me
And tellin' Hollywood no one
Tellin' Hollywood no one
I was tellin Hollywood not to push me
And tellin' Hollywood no one
I was tellin Hollywood not to push me
And tellin' Hollywood no one
I was tellin Hollywood not to push me
And fuck it I'd rather be goin through
What would you do for a woman who push me
Threw me down a flight of steps
And never shoulda' come to the rescue of me
I remember cryin' at the top of my lungs
Now this is my little miracle,
I'm givin' Amy Winehouse a try,
Can't no longer ignore my look
And it just tears my soul out
Doesn't it?
Oh God no!
Now grab the scissors
Cut the paper and the pencil
And go to the car wash
Cut the baby's neck off, still alive
Trying to drag the dead body out
Some slut so twisted
I'm still tryna cop 'til the pot is boiling
Aiyyo t.i.b.drama, its that junk you goldie
You must be out of your mind
Aggravated rapist
Spent your whole life trying to prove
You aint shit, man you shoulda killed the bitch
You'll never, not even if you wanted to
But you know that the life you turned to a basement diss
Is saucy now you must of had the fun
'Til the chopper slid
I hit the gas
Took the whole house in her (ha ha)
Shit, I wish I was dead
But I just kept goin crazy
I'm a direct result of you hating on me
And by the way
You probably know the story behind it
I spent the winter in the attic
Open flossing away the blood
Went to the bitches, pleading
Please don't let me be me, I need a father
I've been down a road
I'll beat the shit out you in a couple weeks
You probably know the name of my blood
The road that I went, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
That road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm back
The blood road, that I go, I don't know why
But I guess I'm backI guessin' it straight out
I guess I need a lil' break
I'm sort of rolling with the dough (yeah)
I mean, sometimes it's hard to find time for all these crazy shit that's out
Everybody's gettin' to be just a little bit crazier
Catch me if you can, Nick Cannon just passed you in the lobby
Hi, it's me, what? You want some?
I dunno, just a friend of mine
What is he sayin'?
"He's just a friend of mine", from when
====================
Sound like a fight to the top
Shake your head like bear hugs
What you doing to the world? You're f***in' with the world
And I'mma make your life miserable, you're gonna fucking kill yourself
I'm bumping a bitch in the street with a car door hinge
She's pregnant, I don't need no help
I'm chucking at his trachea
She's in the trunk, he's chucking dead hoes
I'm bumpin' him with the trash can
Going, "Here, let me grab this tools, and I'm coming at you from this angle, and you can't duck it, and I can't back it"
I'm punching the air in his face with the bat
He's so mad, he's got his jaw chipped
I'm chasin' his chest with a belt
I'm chasin' his face with a mask
I'm chasin' his chest with a mask
I'm chasin' his face with a mask
Yo, how come you couldn't quit with Shady
You were so eager, you quit, you bled so much that you didn't
You quit, you jumped in front of a gun and let it
walk, now you propped it up so much that it
shouldn't have took you
So, why do I keep giving you reason to wanna kill
Why do I put so much hate in your tweet
And put together just a mere 50
So, get down, you're gonna feel
Like a boss when I slump, I'm a bitch
I'm a. Don't like it? Like I'm great?
Get the hell outta my mind, bitch!
I'm gonna fuck you up! My tea's gone cold I'm wondering
Why am I such a fucking prick?
Why do I act so wimpy?
Why do I act like I'm so cold
I don't understand why I'm so warm
And someone said to me, "Don't act like a fan, you want to get cold-hearted?"
So, I said fuck the person
I hate, I'll kill him like I'm KillasKryptonite
And a therapist told me to shut up, and when I did, it made me ill
And, I hate it
So, I'm poison gas, I'm sick of it
I hate it, it's sick to watch
But, it made me into the guy from the movies
I just hate it 'cause it sucks, yeah, suck, yeah
I'll shit on you, suck, yeah, suck, yeah
Hate it is, hate it is
I'll shit on you, hate it is
I'll spit on you, hate it is
I'll fuck you up if you look at me
If you are a slut, I'm a world of sires
I'll shit on you, shit see, fuck you
I'll shit on you, shit see, fuck you
I'll shit on you, shit see, fuck you
I'll shit on you, shit see, fuck youModels know what it's like to be cut
From the hand of a man who just happens to be your manager
Tell him that your goal is to eat dough
I'll fuck you up tomorrow, boss
What you missin' about junior? Next thing you know, you's married to Rosie
And your baby's grown, right? Misses you will still be missin'

Yayo[Intro]
You wanna start with a blank stare?
Or should I say stare in a blank look
like this (ya see my nigga)
start to think that I might be one of them kids on the
Block (yeah)
who start with blank stare and go through and
make it official I'm the illest nigga to grace the (block)
my peers and I just might get rolled
cause I'm so soft
like cocaine (yay)
and the streets that I might slip and fall
like I might just need a drop of liquor
like ice two pills and a half
a nice day for the fresh start
now GET OFF!
Okay

PJ:
[Chorus: x2]
My mom always told me, "If you really felt like you were going to die..."
I always said, "If you really felt like you were going to die..."
[Proof]
Yo I'm always right here with
the best cause and emotion I can think of
is how my mom felt when my feet were on the ground
and I'm still in touch with my momma through
our family...
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Baby mama said, "I don't want you dying, this is the wrong message to tell you..."
I got her by the hand and she choked
I said, "Ew, she said it was for me, not him..."
I used to tell rappers how they could hurt your mama,
but she don't want to go that route
My mom loved me and my dad hates me
And I know him for many reasons
but she just don't want me to go that route
So before they cut me off at the door
I told 'em, "We want you to know, we love you..."
I told every motherfucking mama in the house
"I don't want you dying, this is the wrong message to tell you..."
I got her by the hand and she choked
I said, "Ew, she said it was for me, not him..."
I used to tell rappers how they could hurt your mama,
but she don't want to go that route
I told 'em, "We want you to know, we love you..."
I told every motherfucking mama in the house
"I don't want you dying, this is the wrong message to tell you..."
I got her by the hand and she choked
I said, "Ew, she said it was for me, not him..."
I used to tell rappers how they could hurt your mama,
but she don't want to go that route
I used to tell 'em, "We want you to know, we love you..."
I used to tell rappers how they could hurt your mama,
but she don't want to go that route
[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
If I had just kept my temper and acted like fuck the world
I might have made the cut
I might have stopped the game
I might have stepped up to the mic and said I'm glad that my flow is spiking
I'm happy that I'm alive
I just might have made the cut
if the stakes were right
I might have let my mothafuckin mouth drop
I don't think she understands that
Mama Mia!
Mr. Porter!
Yes! Yes!
Oh! Stop! He's upstairs!
Mr. Porter!
Mr. Porter!
Mr. Porter!
(both Mr. and Mrs. )
both Mr. and
(wham!)
both
(oh my god!)
(women scream)
I just stopped! Went back to the lab!
She said, "Mr. and Mrs. Porter, your husband's involved in a lot of shit, and I know that your husband's involved in a lot of shit too.
(chorus)
Oh, what the fuck, whoop that ass!
Oh, what the fuck, I don't know!
Oh, what the fuck, I do know this shit!
Oh, what the fuck, I don't know!
Oh, what the fuck, I don't know this shit!
Oh, what the fuck, I don't know this shit!
Oh, what the fuck,
====================
Cause I don't think you understand that..
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
You don't have to pay me not to know that...
I don't hate you do I?
I just love you
Sometimes I just want you to know that
I'm justma let you go but until then
I'm justma take your place
I guess it's time for you to die
I told you I'm not afraid of this fuckin wastin it
I don't know if this what it feels like
To walk in the store with a gun to my chest
And expect no help
No reason not to shoot
But until then, I'm justma let you die
I told you I'm not afraid of this fuckin wastin it
I don't know if this what it feels like
To walk in the store with a gun to my chest
And expect no helpMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Mister "I'm Not Peeing Around This Thing" You Knew That Thing Was Coming
You Think I was killin' these hoes
Who knows?
Maybe I was just tryna' hide from you
I don't remember tryna' tell you
Sittin' inside your dreams a trippy little girl
With Hello Kitty on its bottom
Trying to, sit up in the
Feeling stupid, tryin' to figure out what the hell is up with this logo
Dear Stan, I didn't, I was tryna, just ducked
And got jumped by all 5 of you
Went to your mother's house
Don't know why, but I guess it's
Your dream dad, did I not,
Or did I have enough doubt
That I could break into your house with a knife and kill you
So I guess it's that time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
Yo, yo
Dear Stan, I didn't, I was just tryna
Fuckin' to,
And got jumped by all 5 of you
Went to your mother's house
Don't know why, but I guess it's
Your dream dad, did I not,
Or did I have enough doubt
That I could break into your house with a knife and kill you
So I guess it's that time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
Dear Stan, I didn't, I was just tryna
Fuckin' to,
And got jumped by all 5 of you
Went to your mother's house
Don't know why, but I guess it's
Your dream dad, did I not,
Or did I have enough doubt
That I could break into your house with a knife and kill you
So I guess it's that time for you
I guess it's time for you
I guess it's time for you
Dear Stan, I didn't, I was just tryna
Fuckin' to,
And got jumped by all 5 of you
Went to your mother's house
Don't know why, but I guess it's
Your dream dad, did I not,
Or did I have enough doubt
That I could break into your house with a knife and kill you
So I guess it's that time for you
This is it
I'm done tryna walk out of here now and leave this bitch
No need to go to the hospital
Open the gate for anyone
Enter through the back door
Take a few steps
But don't give way
A couple of people
Could otherwise be heard outside
It could be a car with the windows down
Slipped and ripped like Saint Laurent underwear
Chorus
Oh, I don't know, maybe
I just, forgot
Who am I kidding?
A bunch of little kids?
Yeah, look, there's a fight here
Rappers fight in a sport,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenas,
they fight in arenasAlright, so now you know that I,
====================
'Cause all they do is scream, yell, and fuck us
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
So they're screaming, yell, and fuck us
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
So they're crying, and fuck us
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
So they're screaming, yell, and fuck us
'Cause they don't know what it feels like
So they're screaming, yell, and fuck us
And I'm the reason they can't go to sleep
And I'm the reason they can't wake up
And I'm the reason they can't fight
And I'm the reason they can't breathe
And I'm the reason they can't fight
I'm the reason they can't understand us
They don't understand us, when they saw us
They saw us with their bare hands
They had a vision of a tonight in hell
They saw our bodies lay
Just outside the door of the guest house, and they said, "Oh, it's okay, we gotta go, we can't leave now!"
Kuniva said, "Let's go, we can't go now, we can't
Go, we can't go now, we can't
Go, we can't

This Generation, we're gonna face it now
What do you see the most? Shady
I see the penitent
With bullet wounds all
While I write this, serenity
To think I love this woman more than you
See me write and act like you loathe me
But you're the one that I've been holding dear
Though we grew apart, what's on your mind
Is bringing closure to me
What you don't wanna hear is the chorus
'Cause I'm getting paid for this love
So everything I write is for you
I put it out and only sit through my dinner and cavort
But I don't spare the energy that way
Keep living your life and what you look like the rest of my life
And everytime you look down I'm supposed to be there
The one with the gun
I'm supposed to be the one with the shot
'Cause everything I write is for you
I put it out and only sit through my dinner and cavort
But I don't spare the energy
====================
I'm not a Hollywood type of person, but I get to make a living off them
filmmaking
Clerk
Deputy
Poster child
My life's like a popcorn classic, yeah
There are so many more laughs
I'm thankful for the planet
grrr
I'm a food stamp lotto
My trailer sat next to the linens
Which is to say I could just eat the trailer tomorrow
Which is to say I'd probably die if I ate the pussy today
Which is to say I'd probably die if I ate the pussy today
I'm so horny today, I guess I just hate bitches
Clocks
Pants
Dicks
Hoes
Momma
Yeah
Shorty I love you
Chorus
Oh yeah
I think I just pulled the plug
Yesterday
I was so eager to get back
I overdosed on prescription medication
and just couldn't get it
Plus
I was trying to get my P.T.A.G.T.
To stop the X-Men
Coming through for the first time
Running up in your chopper
Screaming F.B.I.B.
When will it stop?
I think I need some Xanax
and I'm not at all pursuing it
Alot of people are panicking
I think I'm about to choke
I think I might just faint
You're coming with me
and I ain't even back
That's the only shot I got
I was panicking and scrambling
Looking for someone to clutch
and gee, I gotta get that
You're not searching for a spark,
it's just the last shot
I'm just giving you the chance to shine
and all the chances
are gonna be wasted
It's like giving up a friend
All they do is taunt me
And I'm thankful for that
But it's like a cycle that's following me
And they panics and panics
And they panics
I'm like a fish in this sea
and this is the story of me
And this pen, when it comes to pens
I'm so full of myself
I feel like I'm on top of the world
I'm so full of myself
I just let it go
I'm free flowing
I'm not a person who can be locked up
Just because I'm famous
They say I'm a walking disease
But I'm a disease, I'm a disease
So they say I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking
I'm a walking, walking
I'm a walking, walking
I'm a walking, walking
How you gonna treat these pooh-poohing, coo-poohing, coo-poo
Feels like an hour left, on the clock
I'm at work, yeah I'm home, I'm home
I'm a walking disease, I'm a walking disease
I'm a walking, walking disease
I'm a walking, walking (I walk, walk)
Walk in the park, walk in the sunshine
I'm making a new habit
I'm going back to walk the dogs
I'll walk with them, however long that it takes
I'll be living the Walk, my Walk
I'll walk with them, however long that it takes
I'll be living the Walk, my Walk
I'm so full of self-esteem
I feel like I'm walking the entire island
I walked the entire world, in a box
I got my cane and just kept kicking it
Never realized how much of a pain I'd be in
Probably shouldered off the couch
Stood on the other side of the world
Just for to walk a straight line
Felt like I was goin' nowhere
Till I looked around and saw a whole new world
I walked a straight line
Felt like I was going, world wide
Told everyone in the car
I'm sorry I walked straight into it
Maybe if I'd just opened my mouth
I might not have said a word
But I sure am sorry I walked right into it
And I'm so sorry I apologized to my fans
And apologized to Hip Hop when I said I'm a walking disease
And I apologize to the world
So I just know that its sickening when the glass is half gone
And the pain is gone, it's too easy to forget the bigger picture
The bigger the hole, the bigger the hole
Complete lack of self-esteem
Drop the chains, quit admitting you little motherfucker
Is now I got my baby at the altar
====================
I'm a criminal, innocent until proven guilty
Then hang me if you don't want me
I'm a criminal, innocent until proven guilty
Then hang me if you don't want me
I'm a criminal, innocent until convicted
Then hang me if you don't want me
I'm a criminal, innocent until convicted
Then hang me if you don't want me
I'm a criminal, innocent until convicted

I use it like a thousand volts, with no extension cord
Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy
Teenage boys, teenagers spendin' this monstrosity
Still going strong, that's what I'm spendin' money for
I use it like a thousand volts, with no extension cord
Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy
What goes through my mind when I'm swinging this thing?
What goes through my mind when I'm swinging this thing?
This Mona Lisa with her goatee
On the floor of the living room, with its its lights off
It goes a little bit like a little brother, goes under the stairs
Down to the basement, over to the bridge
Down to the bridge
Oh, he's coming too, Molly, I'm crazy
Come on, we're in the club at a brisk pace
I aim to throw you both off the edge so fast
That you might as well fly through the midsection
Oh, he's coming too, Molly, I'm crazy
Come on, we're in the club at a brisk pace
I aim to throw you off the edge so fast
That you might as well fly through the midsection
Oh, he's coming
Soon as the first words come, I'm laying in the mud
Foul floss, I'm campaigning for mayor
Oh, I'm going postal right now, I have no time
For these lame interviews, and these phone interviews
I do this fifteen second guessin', throw you in a deep punch with no room in A-ball
Two letters, and I'm still alive, still laughin'
Even if the grammy I end up with
Probably won't even make sense to you
Hows that's a thousand digits, um, six-eight
Sixteen, seven to go
I'll break your leg, that's a thousand digits
That's a thousand digits
That's a thousand digits
That's a thousand digits
Oh, he's coming too, Molly, I'm crazy
Come on, we're in the club at a brisk pace
I aim to throw you off the edge so fast
That you might as well fly through the midsection
Oh, he's coming too, Molly, I'm crazy
Come on, we're in the club at a brisk pace
I aim to throw you off the edge so fast

Oh, he's coming
Soon as the first words come, I'm laying in the mud

Oh, I'm going postal right now, I have no time
For these lame interviews, and these phone interviews
I do this fifteen second guessin', throw you in a deep punch with no room in A-ball
Two letters, and I'm still alive, still laughin'
Even if the grammy I end up with
Probably won't even make sense to you
Hows that's a thousand digits, um, six-eight
Six wanting to go
I got a thousand and a half, it's a thousand
And I'm aiming for a million
You want to throw me off, talk about a volcano
A volcano in a million years, I'll throw you off the face
And wipe you the floor with a broom
Shit if I don't, then I won't fix this soon
I got a thousand and a half, it's a thousand
And I'm aiming for a million
And I'm aiming for a million
Fuck the world, fuck the Grammy
Fuck the Macmillan, fuck the whole industry if you doubt me
I'm a fagot, believe me homie, I hate awards
I'm so jealous, I wonder how many kids I kill
How many hats I leave on my mom's neck
Slap my dog, bitch I'm a bitch, show me your paper
I'll flip it in my lap, bitch, show you my reel
And you won't flip shit when I flip it in your face
I flip it in your face,fucking hate
[Chorus]
It's ho', it's ho', it's ho', it's
It's been a long time comin' and I'm ho', I'm
Wait a minute I forgot what aUTEAN

You can do it your way
You can do it your way fine fine, fineI told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back
What now nigga what now what
You's the projects nigga
[Chorus]
One shot two shot three shot four shots
All I hear is more and more of what I hear is pop
I think I'm about to lose my mind
All I see is a blur from a distance
When I invert what's going on between us
You see that's why I call it crucible
Cause when the pop hits I think I'm gonna retreat
Cause when the guns are startin' to fire
Me and Dre are like two foxes
Kiss the moon landers and forgot the fact the moon
Would come back on moon landers again
And I think I'm runnin' out of ammo
So yeah I'm gettin' the paper right I ain't shoot at nothing
Rappers are killers just like sheep
And I'd never trade for you
I'd never grab a razor for you
I'd never grab a razor for you
I'd never grab a razor for you
I'd never grab a razor for you[Eminem]
This world is mine
And I'm not looking for nothing in return
None of you fuckin' docs
Come on docs
You know the fuckin' song
Is about to get serious doc
Hey, how you doin'?
You know the fuckin' song
Is about to get serious
Do you want to go or you shut your fucking mouth
You said you aint in the mood to mess around
And that's a choice
Well fuck it, I choice, go play the island
[Obie Trice]
Don't ask me Obie, I'm not with you in the studio
So Gotta listen to me, but you know I quit, I'm just fuckin' with you
This Is Never A Snatch, Me and Obie, We Never Dumped The Pup In The Back Of The Ac
So, Aftermath
So, Aftermath, how come you couldn't find the tear stains
Since when we last played, your vans would come home gasping
And we wouldAutomatically Suck Thy Assholes
Of course we rip every fuckin' magazine out and point it at you
But you ain't nothin' with us, so fuck that shit
We can't fuckin' kill ya
We're killin' killin' killin'

So this is my life, my words comin' from this side
So listen up, you're listenin' to the rules cuz they hate me

I'm in a white in his 20's
Police car in my 40's
I'm walking my a** west
And I could be dangerous, in a blink of an eye, I'm
Ain't no one around, what the fuck you wanna do?
I walk around mad, you can call it seance
Cause I'm a rebel, walking my a** south
And all my people from Mars
All my people from the 50
Cause I'm a pop, I'm a rebel, walking my a** south
And all my people from the 50
Cause I'm a pop, I'm a rebel, walking my a** south
Guess who's back, back, yo, who's back
The 50's return
After 13 years, they still don't let me be solo
I'm still standin' by this,
My people will never see you again
They said if I wasn't so goddamn mad,
Then I'd probably still be outta gas,
Went to church every Sunday,
Went to shave,
Went to read the Bible,
Went to pray every Sunday,
Washed your ass,
Went to take your kids out to the beach,
Went to take you out to dinner,
Went to bathe,
And more,
I'm still mad, but I'm not afraid of danger
Of dying, of dying, of dying, of dying,
Yes, I am, I'm going to die,
I'm going to die, (bye bye)
I'm dying to see you,
(I love you)
I'm dying to see you,

I told this bitch to slow down, slow down
I told this bitch to slow down, slow down
She didn't like the fact I was off the water
I told this bitch stop ducking
I got my knife and she stabbed me in the fuckin neck
So, I'm steaming in the cold water
Let her neckLick, b****, b****, b****
Who the fuck passed you the mic?
I had a little surprise for you both
You missed it, I'm always
====================
Two words: defensive back
Hustle hard, this will take skill
Intellectually speaking, I'm better than them
Brains, I've been training hard to reach,
And this ain't just a drill
This is a defensive back drills
I'm just trying to get my ass off the ground
Two words: defensive back
Hustle hard, this will take skill
Intellectually speaking, I'm better than them
I come with the best defense and try to stay ahead
As long as I can stay ahead,
I'm just trying to catch a buzz and stay fresh
Two words: defensive back
My dick is sore now, I got the funds to buy a prosthetic arm
And I got a tattoo of Darth Vader and Ah, poor soul
I hope they cut my fucking head off, I've been standing there
Still standing there,
Like it's raining and snowing,
Like I'm trying to count down the days until Christmas
Then I hope they catch me on Easter Monday
I'm still standing there,
Walking dead, it's all dead and gone
I guess you could call my murder weapon
But still I try to live a regular life
Assuming they don't cut my fucking pay
It's funny,
Don't you think that we can get along the shootin' you pistol
Don't you think that we can hold you responsible for my fuckin' actions
That were so bad that they deserved to be sued for embezzlement
And that I would score a dollar in lotto,
And that's just for signin' my fucking flyers at the mall
Just to get you all the way there
I'm still standing there,
Walking dead, I got the funds to buy a prosthetic arm
And I got a tattoo of Darth Vader and Ah, poor soul
I hope they cut my fucking head off, I've been standing there
Waiting for them to let me off the hook
So, I'm waiting for them to come around,
And they don't come around until I'm fucked badly
I'm waiting for them to come around,
And they don't come around until I'm fucked so
Much
That I'm wonderin', "Why am I such a fuckin' asshole?"
Am I a fuckin' sinner or a fuckin' asshole?
Am I a fuckin' sinner or a fuckin' asshole?
I'm a fuckin' bitch, if you fucking consider me your fucking bitch
Then fuck me warm, then cold, then warm
Hustle hard, you'll melt any suit you wear
I'm a fucking pimp, and your fucking words are fucking killers
I might leave early, wear 'em later
Stay in bed, cause I'm watching the oscar,
Screaming Fuck Dolly Parton, I'd rather die then you fuckin' wit
Testing liquor, Dolly Parton, I'd rather die than you with
Testing liquor, Dolly Parton, I'd rather die than you wit
Nuts, nuts, faggots see you take it
They say I look like a fuckin' sissy, yeah
I'm known as one of the suckers, yeah
Take your dick out, you little faggot
(Hail Mary please accept this as a warm welcome)

Get rich or get fucked
Ain't no one in it for me
[Eminem]
Is it because you hate it when I talk that you always tell me to cut it off?
I can't tell you what the fuck I was thinking when I
said that, cause there was a lot of shit planted in my head that day
[Proof]
S***, SHUT UP!

Oh, I can hear your heartbeat
It's urgent
I put the phone down, it's urgent
I think I'm passing out
I'm on my way to work
To get a fuckin' diamond
And my fuckin' bestie
Coke, Coke, Vanilla Ice
I'm a cipher
I set the world on fire
Don't point it at anybody
But rather point it at
Em
Cause ain't no one who's as dope as me
Bad as me
Bad as me
Bad as me
Bad as me
You're probably familiar with Obie, the soft-nurse
Who cooks up the cheese and ill-prepared
Who makes the little people eat the sick
And arranges the sick for his grandkids
And ill-fame it's heir, rest of his life
He may not be as bad as you think
But he is me, who's the baddest bitch in the house
Who's always in the sickest and truest
Who picks the kids up in the cribs
And puts the kids in the damn van while the kids are at the play-pen
Cause when he gets to pick up the guitar
His guitars will just keep playing
When will he learn to sustain?
Cause he must buy a goddamn gram
I told you it's bad for your health
I don't like the sound of it
I don't like the shit I hear when I'm hearin' it
Don't like the music
It's like the music's played
All these drugs cause they bad for your health
(Come on)
Gimme the mic, let me hear ya
I'm a walk up in the bar scene
And I ain't playin' no games
No one respect you y'all or anything
I walk up in the room naked in a doghouse
Have you ever seen the half-naked Michael Vick?
Look who's got you goin' crazy
I'm goin' in your hair, fucking your mother
[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear your heartbeat
It's urgent
I put the phone down, it's urgent
I think I'm passing out

Who keeps the kids in the cribs
And puts the kids in the damn van while the kids are at the play-pen
Cause when he gets to pick up the guitar
His guitars will just keep playing
When will he learn to sustain?
Cause he must buy a goddamn gram
Oh boy, I almost forgot
It's urgent
I put the phone down, it's urgent
I think I'm passing out
I'm on my way to work
To get a fuckin' diamond
And my fuckin' bestie
Coke, Coke, Vanilla Ice
I'm a cipher

To get a fuckin' diamond
I'm a secret
A little girl, I love you
I love you
I love you
She's my baby, she loves me
 I love you
I told you I love you
I just put flowers in your coffin
Lay awake in the morning
Couldn't see which of us would
Call her my girlfriend
Just the other night I told her I loved her
I just loved her

I'm eatin shit like it's happening
From the depths of hell I've emerged
And I'm in the streets of disgust
With my jaws down and my teeth up like Triumph,
In the second that I come close enough,
I put my whole neck and whole side of my neck on
Stomping and my whole face and whole side of my neck
Off a ledge like Jell-O, my whole back is on
And I can run circles around you like I'm running from Superman
And so it goes for the heroes of our day,
And for those that are past,
We embrace, with love, the present is the future
And the future is glorious,
And I will always remember those that we beat,
And the ways that we clawed,
And kept kicking ass in the present,
And I'm swingin' my baton on the track,
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid,

Is it me or do I look like a banana,
like a bum on a bad day,
our spirits high,
and your breath getting hot,
know that you got egg in your face,
I told em, 'hey look look',
let em get in,
its your fault,
my words gettin' them caps,
you can suck them words,
I'm a slim shady,
straight to bed of the troll,
witchy with a dead katana,
on to bed of the troll.

Bitch, turn the music up

====================
I never loved you
Always kept you in my thoughts
When I had the penicillin to make you cry
I never wanted you to grow up
Never loved you
Never will
But tonight
You're going to the hospital
For the hospital
For the rehab
Yeah, wait
How long will it be before the demon falls?
I don't really know
I just want to make sure you know
I love you girl
I miss you a lot girl
I got a lot of things in common
I'm addicted
To that pill you took
You said you were going to kill me
But you didn't kill me
You just happened to pick up the phone
It went something like this
Jumped out to meet you
And I was like
"Ok let me kiss your cheek then"
"Ok that's what you wanted"
"Ok then what's up with the lip gloss?"
"I don't know"
"Ok let me do that"
"Ok let me do that"
"Ok then what's up with" that and
"Ok that's what's up with with that
You're kissing my ass.
I'm leaning against the wall
"Ok let me hold that phone up"
"Ok let me hold that phone up"
"Ok let me hold that phone up"
"Ok let me hold that phone up"
I never wanted you to grow up
Never loved you
Never will
But tonight, I'm going to the hospital
For the hospital
For the rehab
I don't really want you to grow up
Never loved you
Never will
But tonight, I'm going to the hospital
For the hospital
You know, I'm in this together
I'm in this together
They called me Rosco
I'm in a whole 'nother world
You're in a room full of other Buddays
Together we sing this song of thanks
And when I light the bonfire
All I need is the wind to blow
And all I I I am I flame Buddays together
Just the two of us
We burn lighter than 100 of us
Smoke like 100 kilos of grass
Together we sing this song of thanks
And when I light the bonfire
All I need is the wind to blow
And all I am I flame Buddays together
Just the two of us
We burn lighter than 100 of us
Smoke like 100 kilos of grass
In between us on the freeway in Colorado
I'm so busy
Driving down a mountain pass
I'm not looking back
So why am I such a lonely man
When I think I'm melting away
In a fatal lack of backbone
Someone's knocking on my door
Looking for me like I'm serial killers
Someone that I chase like a serial killer
But they pull the scissors and cut a limb
And slice my heart in half so they can eat Jack Daniels
I'm so busy
I don't even come to meetings
I'm just busy
Just busy making movies
And I'm not going to jail
Feeling so out of control
This world is mine for the taking
World's my jam, world's my dime
And if I'm not the one you want in your life, this world is mine for the taking
So keep working
Keep living your life, and I'm going to make you bleed out
And kill you if you don't let me lead
Keep living your life, and I'm going to make you bleed out
It's been 21 years and 6 months and I don't see no me
This is my life, I'm running around killing maniacs
Yanking motherfuckers' arms out and ducking
Looking like one of them last thing you wanted to do was pull a gun on us
You wanted to flaunt it, we shoved you down a victim's
But you didn't want to admit it
We were coming with guns, you flippin' it
So we walked out and dropped the soap
And wiped our blond hair and laughed
Like the streets we should be ashamed
We ain't been able to stop your assasin from doin'
Now let's go back to the corner
And turn right around
We got a brand new ragtime
This time we won't even call it a loss
Like we lost a ragtime for nothing
Shit, Shady, Shady
I'll never forget
The first time I ever used to snort one
I made a batch and put it in a pipe
And snorted it back and forth until one
Hows me re-enactin' the whole thing again
And got up and down the street in a Ford
Into a ditch, blaring the speakers
When I pulled up
It was clear to me now
That
It's not a sunny day
And the air was so warm

====================

But I think we did a good job
Of keeping the world calm and peaceful
Dre, what'd you do if he was on his knees
And you were with him and he was drunk?
You and your husband could get serious if you got along
But I think what impressed you the most was the fact that
That I could trust you
And you were able to come up with some shitless shit
That didn't involve me
And you could get along but you
Didn't seem to have much of a interest
In living up to your own word
Yeah, I guess that's a littlesoType it's like saying I'm not your daddy
And I'm not your momma
But it's you and me
It's me and my daughter
I want you to know she belongs me and not some toy
That she shouldn't have
But I'm not gonna let her hold me back from growing up a hero
I want her to know that I love her
I'm so glad that you're here
That I'm your daddy, but you don't know what'sin'
You and your husband could get serious if he was on his knees
And I think what impressed you the most was the fact that
That I could trust you
And you were able to come up with some shitless shit
That didn't involve me
And you were able to come up with some shitless
So don't front and play with us
And let's clear this up for the son of a bitch
I see you bitches are all bitches, let's talk about a K

He used to pull my pants down to ease his lower back
Now I'm dropping, spitting, rhymes on the stereo
Thrust around my girlfriend's ass with no seat belt
Feel the wind blow on my dick, are you crazy Kim?
Bitch, I'm about to pull up
And I don't want no lines to begin with
So here we go, 13 years later, I'm still coming off that line
And all this time, I was just fine
Seeing as how crazy and how I am and what I been up to
But this time, I'm coming off that shit too
So you gotta let me go crazy
Man, I'm going bananas
Oh, this my jam, this my jam
The way it goes, bananas
This my my my jam, this my my jam
The way it goes, bananas
Oh, this my my jam, this my my jam

This is the story of a kid who lost his momma, went to college and became a songwriter
But his dad had a problem, so he took him to the doctor
And the damn aspirin was for side effects
Not the little kids, these little kids are all like that
This is the story of a kid who lost his momma, went to college and became a songwriter

This is the story of a kid who lost his momma, went to college and became a songwriter
But his dad had a problem, so he took him to the doctor
And the damn aspirin was for side effects
Not the little kids, these little kids are all like thatI think it's a waste of my time
All this time just jottin', jockin', jockin' and booin' and shit
Man I think it's comin', it's too late to save these little kids
I think it's fuckin' kinda cool to celebrate
And I think saving these little kids is justin' fun
To just jack and play and I think
That maybe it's time to go and just kill some more
But I'm not gonna do it just yet,
Can't I just get the job done
Man I'm glad that they got me at the pen
And I am, but I have a few more projects to complete before I'm finished
I'll have a nice cup of tea and a cup of coffee at the bonfire
And if you're still alive and you wish to get acquainted with my voice
I'll be glad to answer you all of your questions
Excuse me my ma's name but please understand
That I don't give a fuck, okay then
Madame Minister thou dost love me, I love her
And I don't give a fuck if she's a boy or a girl
I'll even give a fuck if she's a girl
But if she's a boy, I won't fuck you if she's a girl
If she's a girl, I won't fuck you if she's a girl
You see, I'm a tease, a silly thing to do
But I really do want to play, and play with myself
But lately I've been rockin' and I've been baby-boomer, yo
Baby, I think I'm doin' some yoga
Honey I think my bum is ticklin' off
I think I'll wear a dress and drink a bottle of liqueur
Cause I just don't have the room in my house for more bunnies
I think I'm too old to drive
Ya HaHa go to Wayne State
[Chorus]
It's a must a crib for boys
Boys may call me playin', but I ain't playin' jack
I'm makin' wack jack, but I'm still makin' jack
Play wack jack, but wack jack won't fuckin' give me that
Injuring, I've had testicles shoved in my ass
This is wack jack, this is wack jack
Yes sir, yes sir
[Verse 2]
This game is basic jock jack
But the concepts are more advanced, you know
And it's the sickest, sickest and most cynical
Formula your competitors is ill
From birth, you can look for a way to criticize
But you soon are put through
This is jack school, you're put through
This is jack jack school, you're put through
Ha ha kids is so sick it's ridiculous
Ha, ha, ha
[Verse 3]
You think you playin' with fire, you better put your bets
Put em in the ground and pull em out
It's jack toe school, you can call em sis
But remember when we played Source you should
Back out too fast
Don't put em in the ground, you can't push em out
It's jack toe school, you can call em sis
But remember remember remember kids is so sick it's ridiculous
Ha, ha, ha, ha
[Verse 4]
I lay in the sun, I'm warm, fuzzy and fuzzy and fuzzy
I'm so fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzy
I wake up in the morning, fuzzy, fuzzy fuzzy and fuzzy
I'm so fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzyI feel the ball, hit the post,
Fuzzy and fuzzy, I touch the ball,
Fuzzy and fuzzy, I hit the post,
Fuzzy and fuzzy, I hit the post
I said I'm back, or check the ball, hit the goal post
Fuzzy and fuzzy, I touch the ball,

It's a time of the year when I throw a party
You better throw a bomb on us
People go to work
When the President's with,
It's the people who go home
The people who go to church
The people who go to church
The people who go to church
The people who go to church
The people who go to church
The people who, the President's with
It's the people who go home

It's the people who go home
The people who go to work
The people who go to work
The people who go to work
The people who, the President's with
What's goin' on?
The plot has been laid
Let's go, when the President's here
When the President's here
When the President's here
Verse 2
So Joe Hill can his ass in the sand
I'm here for the mic, let's go
When the President's here
When the President's here
When the President's here

When the President's here
Verse 3
You never seen harder times
Managed to get by with a lot of debt
But you can't ignore us neither
Gotta fight to keep your chin out of the side of the room
So I'm standing here as a man
What the hell is goin' on?
I don't have no answers no more
You better hope that you got some answers
Next time you may sit down
In your living room and just talk about how much you miss the dog
How much you miss the dog
How come you could not even give us the hug you got
Through the grape vine, through the straw,
I'm a man so I'm a bitch
Still got shit on, but I'm whittin' up
Startin' to pray, started to hate you
Be tryin' to listen, is always a target, yeah
You know, I just wanna love you more
Just let you know that
Just let you know that
Just let you know that
Just let you know that
Just let me know
Alright
Alright
Come on
I think we done both left the same camp
Just learn to live with it, and keep it real
And just be realin' with your family
And partner it real
And hopefully through it and through it
You get the message, that you truly love your enemy
And get through with it
And all you see is more of the blue & the purple baby
Til it rids in, but not before you see your baby
See the tears well up in our eyes
We know you're sad, right?
Well, look at what you did for your wife
You did it hard, and it pays off
But tonight, you gotta kick your tires
And your spouse, so here's the money
And you kicked your spouse's tire pressure
Initiated, forced, decided
To make a new plan
And it's on, on
It's going to be a long time before the money comes
Before the pain does, leave us nothing to hate
And let's let the music out
Before the music stops
So breathe easy, you could hit the brake
And brake hard enough to not knock us off guard
We're not taking any damage, you just doing our duty
We're gonna take what we got
And let's roll
Never knew we could touch so many people
It's like a juggling act
You can't skip a beat, you miss the groove
You just can't live without it, can't afford to be a hypocrite
But fuck it, you can just afford to be nice to us
When the President's back at the D, we're back at it
Yo, if you don't like it, you can get the whole block in a single
Second, you can get your shit out
At the same time you know we love you
And we'll be soamer if you accept our apology
even if it means admitting we was wrong
and we still was right
If you just accept it
It's nothing, we're not coming back
Not even when the Detroit Lions come to town
[Verse 1]
They came to tell us, "Hey, we love you"
They said that the way you lookin, you should too
You should be able to look at us and say, "Wow"
We came to tell you, "
====================
They said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
I said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
I said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
I said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
I said I'll be the reason they can't stop me
My music is like a drug, like cocaine
I might be the best thing you've ever done for your child
My music is like a drug, like cocaine
I might be the best thing you've ever done for your child
You shouldn't listen to my music, if you do listen
It might make you sleepy, it might make you dizzy
Think of my daughter when you think of her
When you think of my daughter, think of my daughter
Think of my daughter, think of my daughter
Think of my daughter, think of my daughter
You shouldn't listen to my music, if you do listen
It might make you sleepy, it might make you dizzy
I just make you mad, I make you sick
You make her sick, you make her angry
I just make you mad, I make you
So what's the difference between me and you?
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm a normal MC, if you hear this then I'm dead
I just make you mad, I make you sick
You make her mad, you make her angry
I just make you mad, I make you
So what's the difference between me and you?
I'm on a mission to make a messianic MC
If you're not impressed you can't be boss
If you're faithful you can't be patient
I make the messianic crew feel welcome
If you're not my kind of MC
You make the paper thin bitch look easy,
If you're not Mathers you'll fuck a virgin
If you're not T-P then I'm gettin' the message easy
If you're not T-P then I'm gettin' the message easy
You're a fucking D and a rabbit,
You don't get to fuck with Mathers unless you want her baby
You're a fraud and you ain't no magician
But if you're not Mathers then I'm in the mirror,
You fucked yourself so bad you should fuckin' throw up a vagina
'Cause you find it disgusting and you degrade it
And you don't wanna come across a kid with that many razor's
In six inch of soap, when you find out that I tried to split
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to doubt your credibility
You're pathetic, it's obvious
You're starting to doubt your own fucking resilience
You're starting to doubt your own fucking resilience
You're starting to suspect your own fucking luck
You're starting to doubt your own fucking resilience
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
Yo this is your jam, yo this is your stomp
This is your fucking verse
This is your fucking chorus
This is your fucking lyric
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is staged
I'm starting to think this shit is stagedI'm starting to think this shit is staged
Now look
This shit's really happening
We on the cusp
Now it's almost a given
That we'll ever leave the same fucking creek
Now shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Then come around the corner
And look like a giant boulder
This boulder's about to send me down
Daddy's here to save me
Daddy's on my dick
I need a daddy to bounce
I'm a grown man,
I know that if I keep going
I will grow as a man
Baby, shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Oooh ooh, shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Oooh ooh, shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Ohh ooh, shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass, shake that ass,
Shake that ass,

Verse 1 [Verse 2]:
I'm in love with the dr.dre era, the more that you got me pissed off, the more that you squeezed me off you idiot, I'm a step beyond the hype, the hype, I'm the illest man, man, I'm the illest rapper to hold the roscoe hostage and blaster the puppet so violently, slap me and bounce off the puppet, go ahead slap me and bite him and eat the puppet, put the heat on him and heat on the emcees, cause I'm hot as the fuck and the hottest man inside you stinking faggot, I'm sick, I'm sick of emcees who just don't got it, who just don't have it, who just don't have the guts to say it, who are the big bad wolfs, who are feeding this hot shit this hot shit a taste as sour as the vodka and the pheny, who can stand in the sunlight and poke a nose in it, and still be able to rip a Granny Smith's head off, and still be able to get a headstart, and still get a living, and I don't really have a choice, I can pick which path I'm on, whether I want to go or not, I'm a picketed, you picket me, you can't pick which side you're on, it's like being on the fence, 'cause you can't pick which side you're on, you can't pick which side you're on. And so, I'm standing here with this hammered up shit, laying here with this battered up shit, and this whole house packed, and if I could just put it all into a single frame, I think I would, but it's like a double-hoof, like a tax preparer, and I'm reminded of the trailer backed preparer, and I think of the projects that were put in, and what a tangled web it was, so I just stopped putting together a single frame, and put all my eggs in one basket, and I think of the good old days when I would watch the news cycle and try to make a single statement, and try to make a single plea, and try to convince myself that it wasn't that big a deal, but it was closer to home, and put everything into perspective, and look at the size of this house, and the fact that this is happening at the same time pretty much says that this is my fault, you know, it's like putting together a Thanksgiving turkey, and it's almost like the centerpiece of the house, 'cause you know, look, I'm so big, and I'm not just any comedian, I'm, I'm the centerpiece of the house, and like, I'm not just any comedian, I'm, I'm the centerpiece of the dance floor, and I'm not just anybody, I'm, I'm the centerpiece of the dance floor.
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Cause man, I wouldn't give a fuck if it was Thanksgiving, I'd roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and roast the turkey, and

I'm going for whoever's taller than me
Who turned out the better tonight, to shake the world
And show us that you're still hungry too[Hook]

Daddy's mommy, and me and my niggas was down
And fed up, gotta have a daddy to hold
So I'm like, "you're gonna have to take your two niggas out there and try to turn them into stars"
And y'all little kids, thinkin' it'll just be another day
But I told you once, it's only when you see daddy and see your niggas
And you see your niggas down in the streets
And you see them in action, like down in a zoo
And you see em go down in a couple of days, that's a trend, that's what,

You got the point, but you got most of all your man that got a
Bad breath in your voice

====================
Your friends always tell me, "You can't do that shit on your own".
My friends see me as a bad mite,
Cause they say I was smart,
And I'm a throwback to the 50's,
When I was scolded and told off by my high school coach,
I just kept speaking a different language,
Cause it wasn't in my vocabulary, but the things I liked.
Two syllables, two syllables, two syllables.
Nigga, I'm from the 50's
Killing the man in cold blood,
Then I'm bringing the country to his knees,
I'm standing in front of a camera,
I'm not afraid of what's coming its way,
You can be black, white or even just ok with yourself
Like I'm not scared at all, and I'm bringing the world to its knees,
I'm standing in front of a camera,
I'm not afraid of what's coming its way,
You can be black, white or even just ok with yourself
Yo, yo

And I ain't playin' that game,

I said
This is what the song called to the group
And I ain't goin back
Lately, I've felt lonely
I don't go to the club
But somewhere in the club,
I met a girl
I don't know why
I felt so alone
I didn't know where I was
I went to the mall
But now,
I feel like I'm goin back to my old life
Cause everywhere I go,
People are goin' so fast
I'm tryin to keep it real
I just want to be back
And it is
But I'm having so much fun
Roving at the same time
Just so jealous
Of all the people that think
I'm tryin to impress 'em
I'm tryin to make 'em hate me
I'm tryin to impress 'em
I'm tryin to impress 'em
I'm tryin to impress 'em

And all I see is sirens
Every time I look

I'm coming, I will never stop
I'm standing in the mirror, mirror in my face
I¼ a child star, makin' a makin' noise
is everybody hearin' Our message be clear?
Is everybody knowin' That what they act like?
Is everybody knowin' That they act like they want to impress
Me? I'm actin' like fuck them all
I'll be the one who claims to be the one, but seems to be walkin'
Behind the camera
ahead of her time
In the papers shokin' like Jessica Alba
Everybody's lookin' at me like I'm crazy
Everybody knows that she's boppin'
But what everybody don't know is
That
has become my mission as the man
To represent the people
So
I am menstruating, and
I don't wanna leave without
a little bit of this skin off
And I am, this is it
Dr Dre coming through, Dre
You know why they call me Doc?
Because when I'm not on the microphone
they ain't playing with my Eroding
Freidrich and Shady and Hennessy
I don't want to mess with nobody so
I went for a blood bath
a x-ray done and a x-ray whip whipped
and eyeball swooshed, show me!
So I splish my pan between two gauges
chick drizzle on glasses of water
goin' over my dead grandmother's grave
blue Jays jackets with Jayson Tins on them
and my trench coats that show through pores
still mixing detergent
to wipe my eyes with while I'm hollerin'
 'Cause I'm kickin' 'em off ahead
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I'm high as hell, high as the Injek
I'll make the world go 'round
I'll make you go 'round
I'll make you up like a square inch
of forest fir
And force you to look like a square inch
of concrete
I made this rap album out of this
I made this rap album out of this
You make rap music, you eat shit up
and sleep, and dead down
I put this on through
And this won't even let you rap if you thirsty
you get your wish now
[Obie Trice]

I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close itI'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
Yo, I took too long
To think I was down with the M-O
Ha ha, I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close itI'm a living horror, I don't love it
I can't believe it, I must be doin' it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close itI'm a living horror, I don't love it

So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a living horror, I don't love itI in, I outI'm not ashamed
To say I'm green
My stomach is full of coke
If it was just me, it wouldn't be
I in the mirror
Loving it but.. I.. I feel like, I.. I feel like..
I'm so girl, me and my boo-boo
Is so girl, me and my boo-boo
Shady, Shady, aftermath
[Lloyd Banks' voice:]
I'm coming to the front door, to sneak in, knock in the door
But in the darkness, I hear the sirens
I go to step in the door, but as I go in I see
A naked man in a bed with his genitals slit
Gaffi, fucking war, fucking little boy, faggot,
Get your brains blown out, and put a heel through his fuckin'
Stick his fuckin' penis up through his asshole
You little sicko, I'll let him suck my fucking cock
Your motherfucking asshole, now your thinking like a motherfuckin' sheep
Little motherfuckin' cunt, you're fuckin' with a motherfuckin' boss
You're motherfuckin' a boss, you're fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mistress
Then there's a knock at the door
It's the hairy faggot, your motherfuckin' mouth
You can call her Bonnie, but I won't let Bonnie touch my
Baby sitter, you better hide your damn magnet
Bitch, shut the fuck up and just layin' when you see me
When you fuckers' bitch, hang your cables, I'll unhook
I'm a minute tickin' off this list
I wanna erase all this pain
I wanna make it look so much easier
I got you bitches hopping on the futon
Bitch, I ain't even gotta tick this off
I got you bitches hopping on the futon
You get your bitch hopped on the futon
I got you bitches
====================
Trying to figure out how to get rid of that fake beef
How do you beef with a beefhead and not get caught?
How do you beef with a comedian and not get caught?
Better get the clip of the microphone
Catch me, bitch!
I'm not an actor, I'm an ultramarathoner
Running on fumes, my oxygen demand me
A father and son team effort
It's the greatest gift you can get
You could ever get
So don't get me wrong
I'm not a bad guy
I'm a dad
You need to give me two things
Psych to help me burn through the grief
(1)
A therapist who's willing to talk about my life
(2)
A friend who's willing to talk about my life
Yeah, so what
I'm not a great guy
I'm not a great guy
Get it mono?
Yeah, I'm not a great guy
Jingle Bells, the steel brain
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth
Back up
Yeah, that's a nice way to start things off
Back you in the day when you was talking to me
I would always joke
That you used to joke with me
Every time you flushed me down the toilet
I would always get a mention
The one time that I used to boast
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth
Back up
Yeah, that's a nice way to start things off
Back you in the day when you were talking to me
I would always point out
The one time that I used to boast
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth
Back up
Yeah, that's a nice way to start things off
Back you in the day when you were talking to me
I would always point out
The one time that I used to boast
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth
Back up
Yeah, that's a nice way to start things off
Back you in the day when you were talking to me
I would always point out
The one time that I used to boast
The day that I put the mic down
I'll be the first one out the booth[Intro]
Yo
There's a certain mystique when I speak that you notice immediately
Cause you just know immediately it's just the vibe that I get
Cause when I speak it's just absolutely jaw-dropping
Cause when I'm saying it I'm talking about absolute jaw-dropping
[Verse 1]
I'm talking to you, all those who thought that I couldn't breathe and pray that I can't
Now I'm just living inside of a five minute talk
So you think 'well it's kind of a fake company man, but I'm just Jay, so it's true')
I'm talking to you, y'all know that I just don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it
So get the fuck out the booth
[Verse 2]
The crowd goes bananas
I guess it's time for the son of a bitch to step up
He screams fuck the world
And I just said it
And he's right
World wide I'm just laughing and cuddling him
And I don't give a fuck with his father
So long as he stays within my zone of comfort
You better give em hell like they always do
They say that every single day that passes
They get more violent than the first time
Shit more like the English louse cause em
They say that I just make fun of his skin tone
So long as he stays inside my zone of comfort
You better give em hell like they always do
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Faggot, faggot, faggot
I guess it's time for the son of a bitch to step up
He screams fuck the world
And I just said it
And he's right
World wide I'm just laughing and cuddling him
And I don't give a fuck
So long as he stays inside my zone of comfort
You better give em hell like they always do
[Verse 4]
I know you thought we were done
We been moving ever since then
It's been an incredible time
It's been an incredible time
It's been an incredible time
It's been an incredible time
It's been an incredible time
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
I'm mixing it up with an ukulele
And I'mma fight with you
Your not even scratching
I'm scratching at the woodwork
I'm matcheling up your love
I want to beat the shit
====================
Can't leave Shady Worldwide
Can't leave him, I don't want to be alone
And I can't leave him
[Chorus]
Oh, he's crazy, he don't wanna grow up
He don't want to, he don't want to (be alone)
But what can he do, he's crazy
He's crazy, he don't want to (be alone)
But what can he do, he's crazy
[Verse 2]
He don't want to give up (bothering)
He don't want to, he don't want to (coddling)
He's Crooked I'm sayin'
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
Of my word, you can count on me
I count on you Crooked I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 3]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Justin
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 4]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 5]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 6]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 7]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 8]
I'm a man of my word, I can guarantee you I'm a man
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
I just don't give a fuck about Yelawolf
[Verse 9]
I'm a big fat ass, and I don't like fuck-ups
I'ma keep it down, no conversation took place
I'm a gangster, so every time I go to meet you in the lobby
I'ma keep a close eye on you, as much as we might get fucked
Could make or break you, if we don't meet in the mall
Or if we do meet in the same bitch, clothes, and place
Let your guard down, it's a tight spot that we both have
We'll see each other in the hospital, soon enough
We may sweat, no matter how many times we say the hospital doorbell
We may rock the parkin' garage door closed
Walkin' around shooting up the block, in your face
'Cause we're so close, no one knows us, no one wants to know
Even though we're friends, we're just parents,
We're just friends, no one wants to know
Even though we're parents, we're just parents,
We're just parents,
We're just parents,
Shit, it's the season to the bone, ho
Come fall we're gonna kick your ass, we're gonna rock your butt
Fuck no jokes, we're just Notimes, we're not peas in your face
We're just Footloose, you're singing the same song
And you're fucking with the same crew, no one is gonna listen
So welcome, to the troupe that's performing "I'm Sorry" please
Please don't upset us, we're just happy to fit in
And we're just your angelic little sidekick,
Don't ever try to separate us, I'm not trying to
Cause we're just happy to fit in
And we're just happy to fit in
[Chorus]
There's a certain mystique when I speak that you notice
Cause it's sort of unique, like when I speak
Cause I talk about my thoughts and my prayers
And it's always enlightens me to just a little bit
Cause when I'm quoting scripture it's always in my thoughts
And when I'm speaking through a human being I'm always speaking to
My fellow human, cause when I'm talking I'm talking to a
Human
I use my body as a whip, and when I'm speaking
I'm speaking with both hands, and I'm always addressing
My fellow man, cause when I'm speaking I'm speaking to a
Human
I use my body as a whip
====================
Show them hell and escape from there
Show em where the hell we are at
We are not cops or prosecutors
We are the people's chosen
Constitutional America, where all your favorite artists are murdered
Rappers murdered and songwriters driven
They plan to leave songwriters
To go see critics and be nostalgic
For when the hate grows colder
They'll resort to means to retaliate
Such as ice the waters of hatred
And the weapon of choice
Is the underground
The underground America, where all your favorite artists are murdered
Rappers murdered and song writers drove
They plan to leave song writers
To go see critics and be nostalgic
For when the hate grows colder
They'll resort to means to retaliate
Music is life, and we are never colder
The more lyrical, the more brutal the killer, the more cynical the killer
You can see us, through the fog
We don't know you, there's only so cold we can see
The road to hell is cold, only the light can save
They call us Superman, they call us Motherfuckers, we're villains
They wanna save us, they wanna see us go
Was never a dream, but the closer we got
The closer they got
The closer they got to hell
I never dreamed I can walk into a room with a fire place cover and a sheet over my head
And still be able to talk, 'til the beat, the smoke rises
I never dreamed I can smoke, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can ball, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can swim, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can golf, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can land, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can fly, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can run, but I did when I was a child
I never dreamed I can ball, but I did when I was a childDre: I think it's been a long time comin', and I'm comin' to get it done
I had a rough time, but I don't wanna make excuses
Faced so much adversity, and came to find it's still today
Even if I'm gone, I know that I've not died yet
I know that I don't love you dawg
But tonight, I'm comin' back to try ta help youg
And it's just the first of; kunai, toni
And ga-ga, so to speak
Isama a, comin' to change the way that I'm comin back to you
Cause when I come back, I wanna be you still
Cause when I touch down, I don't wanna just leave you alone
But I wanna go down this road and show you where you-
From, Japan to, America, yo
Now when I walked this girl down this flight
There wasn't one, two, three, four, five
 like they used to call me, now
Sometimes I think, maybe I should just call it quits
I'm gotta hunt this cat , 'cause this ain't the time
For squirrelries, I'm scared to eat the scratch
It's too sad , I come from the woods
Or should I say plains , 'cause I don't need to go that far
I think about you every day and how much I miss you
And how much I just washed you up
I think about you now , and how much I just dunno
And how much time I wasted talking to you
I think about you now , and how much I just dunno
And how much I just drank your milk, guess I should have seen it coming
And how much you just flat out rejected me
I've been to as far as the trees
And as far as the cats , I've been waiting
For your body to settle in , I've been shovelling it
And if cat paws isn't the answer , then SHUT UP
It's 2001 and young Nicki
You need to keep poppin' that you pussy
Your acting like a slut on my reality TV
But I bet you I'll be back if i see you again
And if I go back to that time wasting on your video
I wouldn't want you to think I'm anti-women
But it's true , I hate it when I see it
 , and I hate it worse when I spit it
 but it ain't nothing to shush
'Cause when I go to fuck you in the ass with that sound
I'll spit the shit out you before i kill you
Gettin' redundant , 'cause i gotta spit it out
Or maybe you need one fuckin' stripper
And one of those is on your fucking ass
And when you see it on

What a tangled web we weave
I'm in the wrong room trying to turn off the oxygen
I'm in the room with the wizard, yeah the ropes
I need a change of pace, I need tenacity
I need to get it across to the new kid on the block
It's been a rough year for the hard-working, but forgotten
People in this room are just as angry
They know me and my struggle as they know me
And it's been a long time coming to terms with the fact
That I don't get paid, I've been standing by it
And it's hurtin me heart to heart
But it's also hurtin me mind
To the point where I'm thinkin of new ways to say it
And I just need to make it work for me
For the people in this room who don't know me
Who don't know what a tangled web we weave
I'm in the wrong room trying to turn off the oxygen
It's been a rough year for the hard-working, but forgot

Yeah, it's kinda like a flashback, like a little snippet of my life then
[Verse 1]
All I remember is having this moment
Being in that chair and having that feeling
And it was, like, oh my gosh, I must have
Took her by surprise
At first, it was like wow
[Verse 2]
I remember looking up and I gotta stare at this sky
I couldn't see much
And then I remembered this
Airport
[Verse 3]
It was, like
At first, it was like oh my gosh, I must have
Took her by surprise
At first, it was like oh my gosh, I must have
It was, like

Two to the one from the one to the three
I like to mix it up with the beat, just to make sure
I don't forget something important
Something I hold most sacred
Something I'll never forget
And I do it well
Spiritual life is in the house, it's us
It's up to you to make the most of it
You did it, us, us, us
You just
don't know, you just
don't know
When to shut up,
I'm the one who's leaning on you
You're the one who's leaning on me
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
Aight, here, let me start you off with the first verse
Before they put me on the needle, I'd just start this blood
And spit in your eyes while

It's been too long no longer the time has passed has been left over from the same batch of shit that passed
You put your life in this, now it's your time to throw it around
So start throwin' your fucking lives in chaos
[Guardians]
It's been too long no longer the time has passed has been left over from the same batch of shit that passed
You got your, own damn pride, you got your shit stopped
You took the place of, the hero that people thought you couldn't play
You threw your shit up in the game, now you throw it around like a man and pretend it ain't shit
[Eminem & Vegito]
Oh hell no..
Oh hell, I think I just..
Oh hell, I think I just..
Oh hell, I think I just have a little bit of envy
I don't fight shit, take it as it is, I'm not that nice
To fight for the respect I feel I'm not that smart
The system ain't working, so I'm starting from scratch
And slowly but surely I'm getting my due
And I'm beginning to feel my full potential..

I don't know much, but I just feel grateful
When I hear good MC's, I get a woody

Eminem:
Sentiential, no reason not
What's this guy gon' be after?
Guess who's home?
I think he's dead
Brain dead
Liable, non-stop
Lotto, non-stop
I just got a body to haul
The wind is against me
I'm a little stressed out from work
Couldn't stay up at night
Wont you please stop bein' your host
I'm a makin' your night
Sleep on my side
Just pull the plug
I'm a feel the sting from the load
Just let the gas go
The wind is against me
I'm a little stressed out from work
Couldn't stay up at night
Wont you please stop bein' your host
I'm a makin' your night
Sleep on my side
Just pick the pillow up and pillow it
And smack it in your sleep so bad you wonder how
If you got the chance, you did nothing
I gotta hustle a living and feed the hungry
I'm livin' my life expectancy
I'm sick of the static
Clinically depressed
Refused to change
Stole the shit
Turn the radio on
Smoke the drug game
I'm a criminal
Put my blood on the game board
I'm a competitor
Put my mind to the wheel
Kill rappers I know how to the wheel
So when the gangstas get down I'm like a snail
I just hit the floor bitch
You can call it kindness in my eyes

Right, right, yo
What the fuck are you doing?
Fucking babies, what the fuck you call a b****?
You little girls are too scared to scream, they're thin skin on the fence
Of motherfuckin' cops to fucking muh'uns.
Right, right, right, yo
What the fuck are you up to, ho?
You know what time it is, you need a minute to think
What are you doing? What are you armed with?
What are you scared of?
What is you Crazy?
What is she up to?
How long are you think this?
How old are you?
How old did you have to be to just light this bitch up?
How old are you?
You know what time it is, you need a minute to think
What are you up to, you need a minute to think
How old are you?
How old are you?

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Think I never knew you this sick
When I met you, you might as well
Be a wit' my bitch
And wear' my coffin
Inside it
Some people just don't like to talk
The fuck is wrong with this man
He's no comedian
None of them doctors or cops
What the fuck is he suppose to be?
A father figure to me
A lyricist and a composer of symphonies
And a poet
And a lotta vocals
Playin' with live wires
Cleaning the coffin
When it's wiped

Yeah, I love it
Hop off to Amsterdam and get your mama some presents
Just to meet you out in the park
Before you get taken away at the county pen
'Cause your mama's a bust a bust

Get in bed with me and beat the lawn mower

====================
This is what I call a happy marriage
A few borderline bouts, some I caught in the grind
But the hatred is gone, the lust is gone
The days are cold livin' without you
But the nights are warm and the months are cold
I'm living without you and you're dying for me
I love you so much I want you to melt off the inside of my skin
I put a knife in her heart, I'm sorry she had to endure
The thought of leaving me and leaving you just don't exist
I'm sick of playing the game and dying, I can't handle this pain
The stress is unbelievable, the nights are warm and the months are cold
I'm living without you and you're dying for me
I put a knife in her heart, I'm sorry she had to endure
The thought of leaving me and leaving you just don't exist
I'm sick of playing the game and dying, I can't handle this pain
I paint the house, I'mma play for the hills
You call the cops, we ride, death scar looms, life ain't too shabby
The streets are empty without us
The police will buy the game, I'mma let you kick it
I'mma show you where the weed was mixed
And who the target was, jay-z portion, pack your bags
We gonna columbia, cus it'll be great when we get to your burial
So death's over, so we say goodbye
So we can phase us
We keep calling ourselves
The Gang of Four
50 Cent and D-12
We keep getting approached
Tipped in the ribs
Bandaged my wrist
Gonna have to restyle my wound
Been dealing with these phlegm harassers
Holding a squeegee
And I don't need one
These phlegm haters tried to shit on me
Someone pushy phlegm so what
I'm down with phlegm
Gimme the mic, let me recite
Keep the mics on the shelf
Keep feeding these phlegm mics
All the life outta my shoulder
It's like a bottle of Dimethicone
And I know what it does
To the ligaments and ligaments
Of my shoulder blades
Like some maniac with a disco ball in his face
It cuts, I walk the streets smiling
Like a maniac who cut his toes off
And just happens to be his shrink
Wait a minute, this guy's his fuckin shrink
Wait he's not, there he is
A crazy man, he seems to be doing stand up
Repetitive beatings make him not feel up
This guy seems to be in his mid-twenties
And he talks a good talk, he may be speakin a little harder
But you can't stop him, he's in the wrong chair
He's lookin for someone to beat the buzz
Someone to knock the fuck out and hug 'till they suffocate to nowhere
To nowhere, they suffocate to somewhere
To kill and eat, this guy's probably addicted
He may be high but he ain't not
He's got a penis and a bellied butt
So when you knock on our door and you knock
"Hello?"
"Is there a friend you can trust?"
"Yeah, looks like this guy I'm supposed to thank him"
So get off of me, you trippiest, I'm not over you
You're gonna get this high, I'm not over you
I'm over you, trippin' over you
You're gonna get this high, I'm not over you
You're gonna get this high, I'm not over you
[Chorus]
It's (The) only (hell) you really care about is your girl
Bitch you're gonna fuck me up if you don't get out of me girl
Get down to business, what are you doin'?
Get down to business to speak to me
Get down to business, what are you doin'?
You're gonna get this high, get this high
You're gonna get this high, get this high
You're gonna get this high, get this high
You're gonna get this high, get this high
[Eminem]
This game is like a crumb, rolled, and pushed
To the next level, this rhymes like a circus animal
Don't stop, you're gonna get this high, I'm not over you
And this is like the night that we both went insane
And I woke up in the morning with this big fat ass breakfast
"How come I don't get sick from this?"
"Because I know you'll never get it, shit you sick!"
"You're not the one that's getting sick, do you?"
"I don't know, shit you don't know
====================
Bored with my life? Don't be one of them
'Cause life ain't no fair, no chance
Everything is gonna pay off
I'm alive and well, I'm just a sick, sick sick sick
Whoo-ho, Shady!
I'm so sick, I'm stomach-churning
I can't eat, I'm having a seizure
I have an E rash on my leg
I'm taking rash drops while on vacation in Japan
I'm writing this rhyme with rhymes, folks, I don't see a rhyme
No more, I'm moving on
Who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my life, I'm a sick, sick sick
I'm sick, sick, I'm an asshole
Yo, who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
Yo, who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
Yo, who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
Yo, who's this?
This is my world, I'm a sick sick
I don't deserve this, I'm an asshole
This is my world, I'm a sick, sick sick
Hey ho, what'd you write on the napkin?
Here's my last rhyme
Yo, I ain't even writing this
I got my last rhyme coming out of that bitch
Yo, is that a pistol?
This is my house, I'm coming with some raps
Yo, is that a pistol grip?
This is a house, this is my blood
You're coming with me, come with me
Every time I'm pushed, I'm pushed
To the ground, with the ground floor
The size of McDonald's beefin'
And my house, with the floorboard
I'm coming with you, come with you
Every time I'm pushed, I'm pushed
To the ground, with the ground floor
The size of McDonald's beefin'
And my house, with the floorboard
My blood flow goes, way beyond the sum
Of My Lyrics, is a spirit that flows
through every vein, I keep growing
capacity that I never realized
capacity that I never realized
capacity that I never realized
It's the Shady, aftermath of the attack
Your pen and your microphone will never leave my mind
It's Aftermath, Slaughterhouse, Recovery
It's Recovery, aftermath of the events of
97 years ago this week.
It's a look and a void
of us that never existed, we all die one day
It's like two halves of the same shit
I guess we just never grew up, it's just that old
Conversation and numb
I just wanna grow old together, yeah, that's right
Y'all little morons, you little queers hate you, you'll just get old, new year
Neil Young, ain't got no legs, you little shit, go get fixed
Pajama time, next time you'll see my legs
I'll put 'em on again, on the wall, with some glue
I think I did it, I really did, I did it for my last mama
Now her name is Alana, she's the one who taught me how to love
Love is the root of all evil
How could I love my baby girl, she won't even swallow
When I kick the dirt off her, she'll grow up to me
And I don't blame her
I put 'em on and they keep on going, but the dumb part
enshed off and on, the dented off
I was 'bout to spit in her, but I gotta get her
But I can't, I can't, I can't, go on
I hate this, but I'm not the type of guy who tries to get intimate with his girlfriends
I can't, but I'll just get over him and get them up
And that's it, that's it, that's all there was to it
I guess that meant the bad part didn't stop, but then I got the call
It was time to move on, at least for the short term
But once I got the chance, I just fell in love
With the idea of moving on, at least for the short
Term
Short term, I'm busy trying to plan
So that ends up
====================
We're living in the dark
'Cause we don't see
And when we
Call
Guard
Nine-Nine-Nine
You gotta kick the bucket
'Cause we ain't showing up for court
All we do is scream
'Cause we ain't cooperating
And when we
Come back we'll be takin' court
While we're still out on the porch
Bumping and pounding the beat
I'm still here
But I'm ballin' in this muthafucking booth
So the party's off to a stand
Just tacklein' the line and we'll get it
And shove this muthafuckin ass chick in the back
And we'll roll 'til we lost her
And we'll tell the world at least we got proof
I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back
'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dyke
All the way to the back'Cause I'm on a roll tonight
As we proceed to shove this fat dykeLadies and gentlemen
You have now witnessed the strength and the minutiae
Of a lifetime in motion capture
Formative years spent in synchronicity
Statistically critical of a newborn
Modest individual to a major player
A symbol of adolescent rebellion
A symbol of adolescent defiance
A symbol of adolescent defiance
Persistence in pursuing a mission
Faith in pursuing a mission
Religiously dedicated to the mission
Lord be praised and thanks be to God
Informal prayer
Overseas, to concerts and conventions
Overseas, to concerts and conventions
Come and get me
Come and get me
Come and get me
Ohh boy oh girl oh
Come along follow me
Come along follow me
Come along follow me
Gonna make a mess of these vocals
Overseas, to concerts and conventions
Overseas, to concerts and conventions
Come and get me
Come and get me
Come and get me
Come and get me
Yo
Yeah girl shake that ass
You don't believe what we saying
Girl you gon' be alright
Shady made it
So it's my turn to follow your nose
Where you gone is where my head is
Came back
Back (repeat)
[Eminem]
Where's my snare
You wanna catch a glimpse of my grin
where's your stereo?
where's my dither
where's my head?
where's my stereo
Yeah, where you gone girl
Where you gone girl
You know what time it is
cause I'm kinda feeling thin
I guess I'm starting to fake
I'm kinda feeling thin
I guess I'm starting to fake
Alright
I'm going for a loop
I'm getting high, I'm getting high
I killed the rumors,
you don't like it
you're endearing yourself
but the bees are not dear
I need a vaccine
you get rich if this is true
you can't live without this
you're so much of a nuisance
thatyou're no good if you're making noise
you get so caught up in your music
thatyou get lost in it
thatyou can't even focus on your music
you're staring at a sky sky
It's like a sea of jelly, I'm out of place
I've been piling on top of the last one
I got to go back to the drawing board
I need to see how much you like it
I've been piling on top of the last one
I ain't going out and flaunting myself
I need to see how much you like it
girl
I used to get so mad at my own label
that I would put up my own album on it
[Eminem]
You see I love myself so fuck it
I'm putting this tape on display
I'm not going to stop, I need to get off to a rocky start
like a tire iron
I'm not stopping just cause this tape is on
I don't know why everybody keeps calling me Eminem
I just think he made excuses
for his mistakes but he didn't give a fuck
why the fuck would he give a fuck
I'm starting to believe that Marshall Mathers died on his fuckin' record
I'm starting to believe that his ghost is back
I'm starting to believe that his foots went in his ass
I'm starting to believe that his heart was moved inside his body
====================
I'm resting on my ass
Just laying on the floor
Shoving a piece of cardboard into a gaping wound
Biting the sex and excitement
I'm mopping the floors
And wiping my ass with it
I'm fucked up worse when I'm underground
Than I am in a mirror
Shallow in my sorrow
Everything is so dark
Where is you at?
You gon' need a flashlight to see
Where is the light at?
I guess I just, forgot
Where I,
Go underground
You know where I'm going
You know I...
I'm underground
There,
In every,
every,
the,
I know what I'm,
I know what I'm
You know I am
[Verse 1]
I am what you thought I was...
I am what you thought I was...
You are what I am...
You are what I am...
You are what I am...
You are what I am...
[Verse 2]
I'm standing in the flames
I'm fireproof, I'm cold enough that I won't suffocate
I'm lit so the flames won't reach me
They said I'd make it to the basement
Just to break up the heat
They said I'd make it to the attic
To the dry ditch
To put you in the trauma center
I'm cold enough to freeze
To treat you to Soma
I'm pissed off

To take a life and I'm not afraid
To let you fuck with the way I go,

To be you, I'm not afraid
To be you

Fuck it I'm sick enough to have a vasectomy
I'll have a vasectomy
[Chorus]
You are now witnessing the final, physical
====================
I'm sick of D-12
I'm sick of these nigga-changers
I'm sick of the 30
I'm sick of 20th century notions of minimum wage
Fuck that, turn that shit into liquor
Fuck that, turn that shit into liquor
I'm sick of these niggas that's different
That's differentI cause you fucking american
You think you own this shit when you own a fucking D-Back
If you can't fucking live without itAye, Weezy!

I'm all for the weak and the weak
Bringing hip hop to anybody who wanna try it
I told you once, so take this microphone seriously
I told you twice, so now we have 30th anniversary now
Yeah, it's a little bit on the sudden
But remember when Ronnie died
It was a tragedy

(Wanda Sykes)
Hi, my name is,
Sophie Turner.
I'm a shy young lady.
I'm always horny.
I pee in the sink,
Hey, hey, stop playin'
I'm never shy in the hallway
I got a question,
(Do you have a shy child?)
Dawg, what's a puppy do?
Do you have a shy one?
Hi, my name is,
Sophie Turner.
I'm a shy young lady.
I'm always horny.
I pee in the sink,
Hey, hey, stop playin'
I'm never shy in the hallway
I got a question,
(Are you afraid of slim?
Are you scared of little kids?
Hi, my name is,
Sophie Turner.
I'm a shy young lady.
I'm always horny.
I pee in the sink,
Hey, hey, stop playin'
I'm never shy in the hallway
I got a question,
(Do you have a shy child?
My mom's scared daddy's not shy, my dad's scared daddy's not shy)
My brain's like a rabbit hole,
[Chorus]
I'm shy, my man is shy
Hi, my name is,

I pee in the sink,
Hey, hey, stop playin'

My mom's scared daddy's not shy, my dad's scared daddy's not shy)
My brain's like a rabbit hole,

(I'm going to jail. I'm going to jail. Yo, yo)
Yo, yo

(Tryna get me off of probation. Tryna get me off of probation)
(Tryna get me off of probation. Tryna get me off of probation)
I'm a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I mean the world, I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I'm terrified at the sight of someone I can trust
I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I mean the world, I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
Nobody wants to see from me, nobody wants to see from me
And they don't want to see any proof, that I sold out all of New York
And they don't want to see from me, anybody, even if they wanted to see if they wanted me
I walk like a walking nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare
I mean the world, I walk like a

This is an interview, with DJ Shadow
[Intro]
Yeah yeah
My name is DJ Shadow, I'm a.m. hock to the underground music.
I made this shit up, and I mean shit to this day
This is my life, and I'm still gonna make shit up
I don't know why this shit's falling apart at the seams
I'm constantly being watched, every single word
This is my life, and I'm still gonna make shit up
I don't know why this shit's falling apart at the seams
I'm constantly being watched, every word
This is my life, and I'm still gonna make shit up
Yo, yo
[Verse 1]
I come around like a poisonous reptile, with a spiked bat
A symbol of destruction, of course I come around like an axe
So it's a little while until I show how I'm killing off
I'm Mr. Shady, a.k.a. the clown
Mr. Shady is my attitude toward everything
That I posses
My pen is all, I'ma get more pens than Kanye, Pencils
And I got all these numbers on my phone
I get people when they visit my page, page pages
And e-mail me back, "What you read on the page was not a pen
You signed an autograph for" (Yeah!)
So the cats just get kicked, and I'mma die for
My lyrical acumen is under attack, and it's getting late
I'm trying to get past the dog and cat attacks
I'm just trying to get the massive Troy support
I'm moving past the fight and get into this big game
Bullyin' and disrespectful, and I ain't even talkin' to no one
So please understandin' I'm never attemptin' this again
And I'm never tryin' to leave another man without the consent of the motherfucking co-pil
And I'm tryin' to live up to these expectations
That are not even being met
And I'm tryin' to raise my standards with this record
And I'm proud to say I was awake one sound
A chorus chorus got me on the stereo
Looking like a mummy, with decomposing skin
Wintoin' what you might be gettin' hit with a white paint
So wake up and get your shells buildin'
A shell chorus got me up and I'm laughing
It was a while ago when I was just gibbin'
And starin' with my snail
And you see you with your eyeballs up in a tub
And I'm just gonna stop working
And you save it for the closing credits
And I'm done with this bitch
So watch what you say
I'm not tryin' to leave
I just wanna be right
And I done told you once
You see that little boy
The bad guy
Who's trying to rob you
Ain't tryin' to hurt no one
Why would I wanna hurt no one?
They don't even try to handle me
See these eyes rolled up like a cross between a potholed road and a dark desert desert
Ain't no easy kid to be Rudolph
He seems to have no friends up in his gats
And his first few days are filled with misery
His confidence is slipping
He`s halting to think that he`s finally gonna break
And what a life he`s leaving
He`s gonna make it, he ain't gonna lie
Life is a bitch
But I guess we can get Hollywood doggin` the time
So watch what you say
I'm not tryin' to leave
I just wanna be right
And I done told you once
You see that little boy
The bad guy
Who's trying to rob you
Ain't tryin' to hurt no one
Why would I wanna hurt no one?
They don't even try to handle me
See these eyes rolled up like a cross between a potholed road and a dark desert
Ain't no easy kid to be Rudolph
He seems to have no friends up in his gats
And his first few days are filled with misery
His confidence is slipping
He`s halting to think that he`s finally gonna break
And what a life he`s leaving
He`s gonna make it, he ain't gonna lie
Life is a bitch
But I guess we can get Hollywood doggin the time
So watch what you say
I'm not tryin' to leave
I just wanna be right
And I done told you once
You see that little boy
The bad guy
Who's trying to rob you
Ain't tryin` to hurt no one
Why would I wanna hurt no one?
They don't even try to handle me

====================
And that's the gist of it
'Cause you'll be sorry if she gets in the way
(What happened to the grace period?)
Cause I was so young, and I thought I was doing amazing
What a dysfunctional childhood, with just an uncle and a stepfather
And a mama vanda, a trunk and a sledge-hammer
My mother, on the other hand was kind of a
Papa Vanda, had a fucking uncle, a crazy childhood
And aunts and uncles, but they didn't mind me
And mom still tries to make it work for us
And the gang's on the Potteries, I don't want to be alone
I'm afraid of what? Krypton, I cried wolf, and my mom
Don't play with my mom 'cause what's her toy, bitch?
It's not enough for her to fall back on, yeah
The line is too long, she might as well stick to the guns
But the moms that I know
Don't want to grow up, 'cause their moms wouldn't be together
And it's like a shadow world, where no one sees you, you weren't strong
And mom doesn't want to see you, you're scared to look at her
Pee, on the floor, with her legs spread wide open
Are you afraid of what? Murder, rape, adultery, cock shop
Where's my kid, he's just an infant, he's scared to look at his mum
Are you afraid of what? Murder, rape, adultery, shop
I just love my city, ain't it?
Yah, it's beautiful, but I wish I could be somewhere
Not knowin' enough to be
Where my kids grow up, bein' bullied, bullied
I don't know it's like my city is no where to be pooh-poo
But it is what it is,I guess they call me Buffalo Bob
I guess that means my kids don't know about me
They call me Buffalo Bob
I guess that means my city is no where to be pooh-poo
But it is what it is,I guess that means my city is no where to be pooh-poo
Ha ha, Detroit, n****s back, Detroit, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back, n****s back
N****s back, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back
Detroit, n****s back
Oh, I don't know, n****s back
Oh, I don't knowIf it's the speed or the boulder weighing us both
We need each other
We needing, one pill

One shot please
The streets are changing
My back shot just in,
The bullets just grazing your chest
Check box, I don't feel like stepping
It's too late to start over
Sending a clear message
I'm not going to return
Your messages were too sick to sit
I had too much on my plate
to go,
And I needed three more shots
so here it is
Six more years of wrong
I'm coming to stop at nothing
I'll be back
Even if it means a thousand mile stare-i-down,
Scarlet fever, oh, it's in my hair
So here it is
Six more years of going, going,
Going, sorry we couldn't agree with nothing
we fought like hell, and died like none other
I'll be dead wrong, killing a God-damn ghost
only thing making me sick and tired of
this city that's never changing
Just changing, no longer being true to size
Still trying to wrap my mind around the idea of
living like this again
The denizen, the outsider, the outsider
Living in the moment, the outsider, the outsider
The outsider, the outsider, the outsider
No matter how hard you try, you won't change
you will always have the problem
My neck is broken, I'm mopping the floor,
Still trying to figure out who did what, and who got hurt
both, especially when you can't change
your mind is bound to be our, ours
We can't afford to be insane again
But we can afford to be here, at least for now
[Chorus]

My tec
My mic
My pen
I just try to get the picture?
I'm tryna leave, what do I see?
I see something
I see something
I see something
I see somethingI see something
Shove a knife in the back of a living hell
Let it be known
Eminem has left
This whole place is lost
They're trying to make a point
You're just tryna leave
And they're just losing control
It's so crazy, I'm sick of all this controversy
I'mma bomb the booth, I'mma blast em'
I'mma use fists, I'mma use my feet
I'mma show em' that these mics are the shit
The street light is dying out
I'mma stick to these rules
And I'll get away just a nickle
Ain't gonna make a biggie out of me
Chorus
Mics are like bars, but are they the same?
If yes, then who's comin' to pay the price
For my resale?

In a embrace 'fore I'm buried
With my chest up in a tub

Bout to tear up the mic 'cause I'm numero uno

There's a certain mystique when I spit this that you notice, it's sorta like a stare down
And it's like you're saying to somebody,

Yeah!
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice that's sorta unique, cause you know it's me, I'm not trying to sound patronizing, I'm just kind of holed up in this room, relaxed, excited, just kind of relaxing, just playing with my toys, playing with your hair, your closet, with your closet put away, with no room for improvement, and I know that's kind of blind, I just don't get it, but I just know what the hell that's like
It's like the golden rule in the business, you have to have some of the smallest pieces, and I know that's kind of blind, I just don't get it, but I just know what the hell that's like
But I'm so blessed, who I'm able to thank God is God, man, I know that's kind of humdrum, but that stuff that you hear in your head every so often, but you don't know what the hell that's like
It's like the golden rule in the business, you have to have some of the smallest pieces, and I know that's kind of blind, I just don't get it, but I just know what the hell that's like
But I'm so blessed, who I'm able to say that I can't, because I'm not trying to sound like a jerk, or anything like that, that I can't, but I know that's kind of humdrum, and I know that's humdrum that's humdrum, and I know that's best, and that's what's best, and I would say for me to make that call is to know that I'm thankful for that, and I appreciate the fact that you're asking me to represent the model, and I appreciate that, and I appreciate the fact that the media understands that I'm not trying to sound like them, but rather, I'm trying to make sure that I'm not only inspiring but I'm inspiring in a way because I know that that's my vision, and it's also something that I've already had the honor of having, and I know that the public understands that, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I know that the lyrics are not the punchlines, they're not the words, they're not the whole package, and that's what I'm thankful for, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I hope the fans understand that
But I'm not trying to put words to the surface, I'm not trying to sell the pants, I'm not trying to sell the musics, I'm trying to make sure that I'm not only inspiring, but I'm not only inspirational but I'm also inspirational in a way, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I know that the record speaks for itself, and I know that the record speaks for itself
It's a beautiful day, it's Sunset, the sun is shining on my soul, I must flee, I must, I must, I must
I'm sipping on a cup of joe, the clouds have been up, I must, I must, I must, I must,
I'm on this mission, I must, I must, I must, I must,
The sun is shining on my soul, I'm singing my prayers, I pray that the storm clouds don't fall, I must, I must,
I am not gonna fold up, I'm climbing up this mountain, I'm climbin' up this mountain, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
I don't want to, I'm afraid I don't, not gonna figure it out, I'm climbin' up this mountain, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
I don't want to, I'm afraid I don't, not gonna figure it out, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
I don't want to, I'm afraid I don't, not gonna figure it out, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
I don't want to, I'm afraid I don't, not gonna figure it out, I'm climbin' up this mountain,
It's a beautiful day, it's the kind of day that you never forget, that you don't forget, that you celebrate, that you celebrate these things in particular
That's why I'm telling you this and why I love the fact that you're growing up and you're growing up
And that's why I love the way that you're

I got a new name, it's short for violent delinquent
I'm a violent delinquent, my name is short for violent notorious
And I got a new name, it's short for violent delinquent
It's shorty, get your face out the way
Excuse the rust, little faggot
Claimin' it after the fact
That you pulled that shit outta your game
Bitch, you did it again
This time, bitch, don't blame me
Blah-blah-blah, uh-huh
I don't know why the fuck I'm here
I'm here to get revenge on you faggots
What happened, why did it ever occur to me
That this was coming, this was supposed to be my life
But you asshole Jerseysuckin' dog
Got it pushed up in the air, so I guess it's time for the
First round, spit it out, and it's up to you
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you bad shit
Second round, turn this talk into shit
It's round six
I get a call that your call has been dropped
From the navy
To the green, my hair is a shade curly
And my thoughts are sporadic
I vibe like a punk when I'm on the phone with a guy
And I'm never far from, no matter where I'm from
So when I hear your faggot shit, I'm feelin' just a little bit...
TIP: If you see a guy approaching the front door
Don't respond (8X) and he's gonna get your number
And if he's a long enough to wait in the car
He'll probably be armed with a deadly weapon
Wit synonyms, so try to avoid the next AK
(Barre-lion) I'm a .45 in the air
I don't aim for the top, my head will spin when I'm aiming
I shoot from the hip, AK show, how do you aim?
I get the broad handle and the balls
Right from the hip, AK show, show, show
Laying on your kitchen floor, get messy, faggot
I mean faggot, faggot, faggot
I just said it, shorty it's over, you assholes
Sorry Im a little shook, but you're in hell for this
It's over, you've been shit to fucking mill
Bottles flew, speakers flew
Flooded with callers, "Come get me, Em!"
Bless you, Bubba Sparxxx
You fuckers must hate your hair, okay
Cos I guess we have to let go of it
This is his song, you can hate it
And tear it off you can even sue us
If you want, you could get our stuff, we'll do it for you
We don't set foot in your house, we stayed
Just watched and we won't hurt you
See we're just playin' us games, you playin'
And we're never gonna let down our guard
See we play cards our bare minimum, and you gotta wanna sleeve your fuckin' hair
Cause these
====================
I think its time for me to step up and say that I love y'all better, better understand me
I think it's time for me to step up and say that I love y'all better understand me
Yo man, I think that you know better y'all ain't got the stomach to take it

And I think its time for me to step up and say that I love y'all better understand me

You better wake the flock up, you just what the doctors told you to go sick of
I'm sick of you, I just don't get it, how can I get over you?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
How can I get over you if I am not your halfway?
Man, get the guts to say it and put it out
I think you and your crew is fucking sick, I think we done peed on your privates
Not once did it dawn on us just what the fuck you'd be like
Fuck your family, your friends and your associates
If you were able to stunted growth, then stunted your career
And I think you and your crew is fucking sick, I think we done peed on your privates
Not once did it dawn on us just what the fuck you'd be like
Fuck your family, your friends and your associates
If you were able to stunted growth, then stunted your career

If you were able to stunted growth, then stunted your career
And I think you and your crew is fucking sick, I think we done peed on your privates
Wit what the fuck we got in common?
Fuckin twins, with fucking mouths
I think I just fucked a bitch who was pregnant
I got an epidural, and I said it was better
I thought she was cute, because I thought
But your comparing apples to oranges
Well, you couldn't compare apples to oranges
I could have put her on the food chain
But I thought I got more ice on my plate
And it didn't hit me until dessert that she was icy
And after that, things changed
I took her to the spot
And placed her face in the curds
And said, "Please Mr. Officer, Ms. Larkovskie,
My tea's gone cold I thought that you liked my hair
But you're such a dick"
"Mr. Officer, Ms. Larkovsk?
Your husband's got a problem and he's always making moves
That's why I ain't here and you ain't got time to talk"
"Mr. Officer, Ms. Larkovsk, your husband's got a problem and he's always making moves
That's why I ain't here and you ain't got time to talk"
"Mr. Officer, Ms. Larkovsk, your husband's got a problem and he's always making moves
That's why I ain't here"
[Chorus]
Fuck you, you dockos, you'll never beat me
I'm locked up, full steam ahead
Guess who's in the back, fucking vans
Fuck-fuckin Nazi, a drill
I'm loading up my shit, load up my bags, get ready
There's a sight that's going off, it just might be my fault
Some bitch put my dog in a crate and run over the vet
I hit the gas, my car is veered
Doctor, it's your fault, your patient might be ill
We got your ass open, but your still frontin'
Don't front, you'll never hold my dick
I hit the gas, my car is veered
Doctor, it's your fault, your patient might be ill
We got your ass open, but your still frontin'
You see that's a sight that's going off, it just might be my fault
Some bitch put my dog
====================
Cause it ain't really about,
What are you on?
I'm on
Cause it ain't really about,
What are you on
You know what you want
And you know what you want
It's a shame cause it ain't
About sex, drugs and love
Aftermath
[Chorus]
It's (the) evening when you barely even hear your f***ing mics
Your night is it? It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And focus on the song and not even focus
On the fucking DJ and not even the fucking mics
And that's it
That's the night
It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And that's it
That's the night
My f***in' days were boring and winding
With no subject matter to talk about
Other than "Jane F[f]any", "My[f]any"]
What if it was just before you
Who would've thought?
After all the bullshit you put your name up in
You were probably about to get your ass kicked
By somebody you never met
Who you probably thought was really, really nice
Step out your fucking chauffeur and get in my fucking chauffeur
I'm getting paid in Kurichs to do my fucking driving
Bitch asses, I'm getting paid in Kurichs to do my fucking driving
Fuck you, who the fuck are you? You think it's a big deal?
I drive you to your momma's place
And you wonder why I spit the n***a names
I fuck you pussy, fuck you bitch
I fuck you girl
I fuck you bitch
[Chorus]
It's (the) evening when you barely even hear your f***ing mics
Your night is it? It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And that's it
That's the night
My f***in' days were boring and winding
With no subject matter to talk about
Other than "Jane F[f]any", "My[f]any"]
What if it was just before you
Who would've thought?
After all the bullshit you put your name up in
You were probably about to get your ass kicked
And I was the bitch, cause I saw it
[Chorus]
It's (the) evening when you barely even hear your f***in' mics
Your night is it? It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And that's it
That's the night
My f***in' days were boring and winding
With no subject matter to talk about
Other than "Jane F[f]any", "My[f]any"]
What if it was just before you
Who would've thought?
After all the bullshit you put your name up in
You were probably about to get your ass kicked
And I was the bitch, cause I saw it
[Chorus]
It's (the) evening when you barely even hear your f***in' mics
Your night is it? It's either that or a blank stare
For what purpose you blind rage, or you blind rage and focus
On the TV and not even the screen
And that's it
That's the night
My f***in' days were boring and winding
With no subject matter to talk about

What if it was just before you
Who would've thought?
After all the bullshit you put your name up in
You were probably about to get your ass kicked
And I was the bitch, cause I saw it
[Chorus]So let's get up off of one of these
Blood, sweat and tears, I'm not in the stable, stay here
And I'm not about to describe the vibe I get
I got as a kid, growing up in a world that was racist
White boy, pigeon-holing, hood hood, hood, hood
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a racist
I just got over that beat and beat the music
Writer-song, and if you think this shit is hard to watch
You're probably on some sort of acid trip
'Til the hood of my neck pull out and my head explodes
As if pulled apart and thrown into a room full of evil
That will make you wanna kill my child
And make me kill his mother
Make me, understand,
====================
I told y'all mothafuckas mothafuckas
What if he was right?
What if he was dope
What if he was black
What if he was holding a brick
What if he was gay
What if he was makin' a living
Living in the black urban jungle
You don't live in the black ghetto
You don't need to teach me
I teach you
Know that I got you in my dreams
But you cannot keep getting me in your dreams
I told you I'd rather beat you
Throw you under the car
Yo I'm only going to get better
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every shred of beef you throw at me
You better make tracks
You better make the drive
Yo I'm only going to fuck you up with a pistol
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every rhyme of your next album
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every symbol of your next album
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every verse of your next song
I told you one day I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every lyric of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every verse of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every rhyme of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every lyric of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every lyric of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
I promise to destroy every lyric of your next song
I told you one day
I'd call you back
Tell you how I'll kick you out of your next house
I'm only going to buy you a crystal ball
Oh boy
I told you once I'm gone
You better think of the consequence
Of leaving me at the end
Of my rope
I'm gonna break you in two ways
First I'm 'bout to kick you in the stomach
(Now a medicine man)
Here's a pill, a capsule, two Meds
And a pack of the flu jabra
Now if you ain't been to the doctor
He won't prescribe the medicine
You can try the medication
But if I'm sick enough
To exorcise the dead flame
You can put the Chills to my skin
Wipe the floors
I'm living ghost for the night
[Eminem]
I'm living ghost for the day
I left my P.O.D. on the porch
[Proof]
Shnubs and pillows, that's all you got
'Bout to get stank
But I won't be stank no more

What's your favorite basketball team?
[Swift]
Detroit, oh, oh
We're the new kid on the block
From the fast and the dime
Where's my favorite thing when you're on the block
Is to be on the block
Eminem, oh
What happens when you combine good music with bad
[Verse 4: Swifty]
Outsiders, Obie Trice, c'mon now
Get down, on these [unverified]
Holy mackerel, I wanna throw down
Lay up the block, on these [unverified]
Holy mackerel, faggot
You can hate 'em or love 'em
Faggot hating hurts. My mother fucking grandmother
Faggot hating everything she produced
Faggot hating rappers hating
Faggot hating sellers hating
Faggot hating the trash that's left in my wake
Faggot hating lives
Disgruntled employee, so I'm suing
My mom and dad for ten grand and a bottle of Patron
My sixteen year old nephew moved out of the D here's a fag named fag weiner
She calls herself a Nazi and hates everybody
But fags are regular people, too
She throws makeup in the trash and calls me a name
So I respect that, but fags hate
What else is new, they sissy don't want me to know
So they holla for me, like Verizon wireless
But that sissy don't care
They sissy feed her dog meat in the paddy wagon
So I'm her new atheist hot potato
So I guess I'm a little bit off the chain
But fags love me and I'mma keep feeding 'em the dog meat
For the last four years I was like slave
'Cuz when you visit your favorite corner mall
You'll find me in the corner masturbating
And you'll probably want to hand me
The keys to my Jeep, because I just
Just a little while ago
Was the White Trash Mountains
I was looking for a little bit of niche
In which to launch an attack
On the current sensation
But it wasn't where I wanna go find nothing tasteless
Except for this friggin' cheese bitch
That's my Jeep, fuck the fucking cheese bitch
I'm giving this a try
Cause for the rest of my life I'll be steamin' across the plains
I'm in the mood for bondage, fuck the bitch
I'm bout to get rid of this chain, its so insane
I'm like the donkey in this bitch, slow or come rush
I'm like the donkey in this bitch, aint no intercourse
The ox is the head, the foot is the tail
Fuck the world, yeah the slaughter complete
The wanktas is the flow is swift
You gettin' plastered all over your walls
Welcome to the new 50, hello there
You broads, you've seen the strength
Walk around like, broads so quick
That you wonder if they even got heads then
They insult your pride
You think these hoes can wrestle
But they just get old
Bout as furious as you get
You know where, you've stepped onto something new territory
Bout as as crazy as the flow is
Y'all know what I'm sayin'
I got a brand new rap game
And I'm sayin' the wrong shit
So homie, take a trip down memory lane
Uh, there's more I'm sayin'
I got a brand new rap game
And I'm sayin' the wrong shit
So homie, take a trip down memory lane[Intro]
Yo,
Aw, yo, (repeat 2x)
[Verse 1]
All these people coming together, coming together cause we're all brothers
It's a time of yearning and a time of mourning
For a time of yearning and a time of mourning
For a time of mourning
One day we all gonna Cher, One day we all gonna Cher, One day we all gonna Cher, One day we all gonna Cher, One day we all gonna
Meeting a sniper, breathing down the neck
Screaming "Yes!" in the corner
Then came the announcement, "We're gonna Cherize It"
Hoping to release a album that would put an end to this sissy
Sippin' on my heart like champagne
Then I collapsed on the bass drum
Threw up a fist, then fell back
(x2)
[Chorus]
It's Friday Night, yeah, we gon' meet in the streets
In the hallway, naked in the bathroom
Fuck the doctor, the nerd, the gay
Fuck the policeman, the straight monger
Fuck the jerk, the fat boy in the house
Fuck the punk, the hoodlum
====================
That's why the President is taking the scenic route and heading to the border
To fill up the road left empty handed
He inherited a disastrous job
And he will have to pick up the pieces after the workers have left
Now I'm thinking of the Marshall Mathers cases
How can he be against same sex marriage
When only 5 percent of his staff identifies as straight
That's 'cause they don't believe in same sex marriage
That's why they walked up to him and hugged him
That's 'cause they didn't believe in same sex marriage
That's why they left him
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
Yeah, the difference
What's hot sauce?
That's what you're looking for in a hot & spas bro?
A little sauce brain strength training?
Nah I gotta commercial
My girl just won't listen to me
Get her spot on
That's my girl you want in your girl you know, I'm just Marshall
Marshall! Marshall Mathers is a villain!
Yes, he is!
He's evil! He hates competition!
Might as well lick the cock
Fuck it I'm coming at you all like a man
You want a dollar? Well I'm coming at you with a dollar
You can make the case for and buy a couple more
Women like this I really, really hope that this friendship
That we've built
Can last a lifetime I'm so looking forward to it
I really hope that you'll stop thinkin' that this friendship
That we've built
Can last a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music
It's on and I'm going at you
I really hope that you'll stop thinkin' that this friendship
That we've built
Can last a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music
It's on and I'm going at you
Aw shit see these women in my Ford
Lookin' like a cross between the Incredible Hulk and a white male
I hope that's what they're lookin' for
Little pig legs, little white trash
Shit, look at all the makeup
I think Im starting to blend in
Ain't no need to go to all that debt
I'm all in, so let's ride
Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' for
Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' for
Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' for

Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' for
Hey girl don't run so I'm not lookin' forIt's a disaster zone
Physically fitted out of a trailer with no shelter
Back behind a brick and a white wall
But in a disaster zone, you can't crawl
It's like these drugs are making me hallucinate
I'm in a room full of coroners with binoculars
Trapped in a room full of cameras
Contemplating the set up and the way things look
The coroner's chair with the carpet and the President
And I'm debating whether or not to grab the napkin and I can't do it
Snap back into the trailer and I'm preparing to tie the ends
I'm filling the trunk with fill and the only option that I have
An emergency t-shirt with the colors of the cover pages
I'm strapped with this heat seeking mouse and it works
And I can't stop the shit that I'm throwin' down
They got a better chance in life of catching a killer whale
A rattlesnake and they're trying to catch a cold
A bunch of slugs and a mite in a house of pain
I've been hit six times
And I've let down my guard
It's like shooting rounds through the glass
Only it's a mask expecting the public to put out the rounds
It's like they just don't know it's this whack
It's a sight to see this is happening all on a black night
And it's getting worse
Everything is flashing lead and I can't hide it
It's getting so dark in my lane
Cinderella lights up, my window is up
It's dark at night but I don't forget it
It must be the baddest thing that ever
====================
So let's see if we can get past this 'cause this shit is real life
Let's take a look at the map, see where we need to go
And see where we can go next
The map's empty
Let's see where we can go
Uh, where we can go next
Uh, where we can go next
I think we found our border, we can start moving
Uh, where we can go next

You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around
Me and D-12 wanna just just just just fight
All I hear is I'm on a mission
All I see is Land O' Larson on TV
So I'm leavin' my own damn skin
Lookin' at these kids on the news lately
It's no fun
All I wanna do is just watch Leonard
Swallow his klonopin
And this guy's half-way across the studio
Just letting him know that his rhyme
is good, and that his meat's close
And that he expects us to shut it down
And leave the world in a condition to know it
What the fuck we think this weekend
Is a catastrophe
Precaution's advised
Emergency camps
Spend some time with your family
Just to make sure that they don't get washed away
Just let them, get their wounds
Return to basics
Alright, time for the two-piece
Toast beef
To crack it open
And let the slaughter begin
I've been ridin' for this city's murder since it started
Choking the fucking bitch to death with a gat
Skewing a blunt
Beat 'em with their clubs
Bringin' gas in their faces
Pullin' the gats with the gas chambers
This ain't even nature
These bitches got a sick bitch
Can you blame her?
The gas chambers?
What the fuck you tell me?
The bitch just turned sixteen
Now the murder weapon is the bung
In this bitch, whores got bitches
And bitches get a gat
So what?
Get the respect
The world is a cursed place
Here's a kiss of approval
And get on down
You and your friend start shit on each other
I'm dope

Oh, you wanna get smashed too?
I got you clappin'
You done made me so beautiful
Oh, you got it wrong
What?
I said what?
Oh, you wanna get smashed too?
I said you got it wrong
Get off me!

Crazy break even, eatin' coma
Yo, I'm tryin' to eat (Carrot)

Sprinkle a little bit of weed on top of the rest of my mess (Rot)
What?
Hit 'em with as much of the weed I get
Leave 'em with the hole that they came from
Leave 'em with the hole that they came from

All these white boys who grew up in the C-Pen
Know that Dre's a gangster's dream
And I can never forget the treat I got at the C-Pen
Sixty guys on the floor at the same time
It was crazy, it was 'till I was hired
This is how I'll be remembered
I was Rosemary's baby
And she was twenty four years old
And I just inherited the business
And that doesn't mean I'm stupid
No, you can't put me up in your family
And if I'm gone, you better hope you can stay up
'Til I'm gone'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gone
Oh, you wanna

I'm trapped...I'm trying to pull myself out of the wreckage
I just trapped, I can't leave...I'm trying to walk...and chew...

I'm staring at the blank wall...I'm staring at the blank wall

I used to be an odd man out 'round here
I started out just weirded out, wit' a twisted sense of humor
But by the sixth album you 'll know you're running out of room
And it in' shape 's a scene from your first single
So it 's funny to me how
I look like I'm running over somebody weird
And they duck
And I got this sick feeling, yeah
I got this sick feeling
Hate feeling when you're hot
When you're cold
I get it, love it when you're hot
I get it, love it when you're cold
I get it, love it when you're cold
I get it, love it when you're cold

If I think it's just too scary for you

My father had a hunch
He was right
I had it all figured out
My mom and dad had a hunch
It was going to be a normal life
We never would've had it
Had it not been for my mom and dad
I think it was in the refrigerator
That's when my brother called me and said
I don't know what was happening to me
I almost died
Mom and dad couldn't dance
Jumped out, lost their Nintendo boys
Nintendo boys
I went to Michigan State
I went to Cal
I didn't want to go there
I was told to shove my baby sister
Up against the wall and beat her
Wagin' around like the prom song
And if I'd just leave Michigan State
I would've had to get a lawyer
And think twice before proceeding
Now I'm going to Michigan
I'm so expelled
My love of the West Coast is dying out
I thought it was the new 'burbs
They told me to shove my way out
But it's Michigan vs.D-W-A
I just wanted to see how it would go
If I had a million dollars
I'd buy a million-and-a-half Mercedes
Maybe go to the Wal-Mart and pick up a new car
But I'm too busy
Preparing for Christ
I'm like the Christ in this bitch
You think you cute don't ya wanna hit the cross
With a bagel or two
I'm getting bullied
I fight 'round the back of the punk
So hard it hurts
I'm thinkin of putting my knife in ya scalp
Suckin' it again
I'm tryin' to swallow my pride
So sick it is
I'm seein' this woman
Sick of this gangsta life
Holdin' onto the hood like I'm Suppeed nice
But I can't go anywhere
I'm sick of being the bad guy
The gangsta life
Full of problems
I think about the things
I think about my daughters and the things
I think about my wife
Inside of her, sick of me
I slap her and she shakes
I'm like a bad guy in her mind
No need for checks in the bank
But the bad news is she's still struggling
ToGETherself
I'm in a rush to get back
She's always on the phone to get back
I don't know how
She handles all the textes
Everything she gets herself
She just hangs on the door
Like a pathetic little pig with no legs
Ohs head,
Something really bad's going through her
She's tryna get rid of that Bitch
I can't wait
I'm not gonna let go of this baby
I've been waiting patiently
For someone who loves me to get off
Someone who truly understands my pain
And understands the stress that I feel
Swellens up inside of your gaping asshole
Wait, what are you tryna do
It's Valentine's Day and you didn't want to mess with us
And Valentine's Day is just around the corner
So why the fuck am I fussin out these halls
You know, the place where the good times were good
And where the bad ones were
And you were like the bad apple by the time they introduced you to us
You were the one who introduced us to this wonderful day
And now I can walk away from it all
Cause your just like a stare that goes up in your eyes

====================
And now I'm the face of rap
The menace that was,
The wholesaler of wealth for your soul
And if rap is a nuisance,
It's because of the way that I rap that my wealth
My words are like a thumb the size of a birthday cake
I'm like a thumb the size of a birthday cake
The way that you write your words, you should be able to
Get the bigger the better,
Better yet I guarantee
The rappers that I rap with
All rappers that I can eat
All rappers that I can smoke
All rappers that I can kick
All rappers that I can suck
These are the people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
The people that I rap with
I got a million dollars, I got a million Facebook friends
And 50 Cent is my face
And you ain't even cool when I'm sleeping
You just fuckin' Facebook, you know I like you
And Twitter, it's my damnedest outlet for all the fun
I got, my million friend, Ice-T
Slap on my face, he's so mad
He likes my songs every time I write him a rapping song
And when I rap his songs
Cause I'm like his phone, it
Has the ringtone of a rapper's ringtone
And I got my phone in my ear, so
Sometimes I just dial up the line
And the line just gets thinner
And more and more they take to him
And it seems, they don't appreciate me
Like I'm so busy being the underdog
That doesn't even make sense, like I
Hated so don't call me
But I'll call you, when you want me
I'll call you, when you don't like me
I'll call you, when you like me
I got a million bucks, I got a million friends
And I'm just like his music keeps getting better
The more that I get, the more that I fuck up
Cause I rap like a douchebag
But at the same time I'm not stupid
I got a million bucks, I got a million friends
And I'm just like his music keeps getting better
The more that I get, the more that I fuck up
Cause I rap like a douchebag
But at the same time I'm not stupid
[Chorus]
It's Friday night came to a sad end
But tonight I'm free be late again
I'm on the grind again just to get to you
You neglected, I'm on the fast lane
Tell that to the homeless man
Just had a big day
Went to his funeral, got a new pair of shoes
His name's Mr. Swagart
He was a local, great a kid
But when he came back he was wearing bad muthafucking shoes
He wished he was dead
But he never would've had a father
He'd never have got a shot, his fuckin' hand would have been on the key
'Cause dad's always telling him, "don't act like a fuckin' asshole"
And I'd never seen that look on his face
If he'd'd'd been here, I never would've thought that he was a hero
When he decided to go to law school, he wouldn't only be a father
But he's a man now, and he's proud to call his girlfriend
Missouri Southern, ho
Missouri Southern, ho
Missouri Southern, ho
Missouri Southern, ho
Missouri Southern, ho
I wake up in bed with Missouri Southern
Sitting on the lawn with Nebraska
Twice, on the stoop with Missouri Southern
In our final stretch, double border
Imperial, imperial, imperial
Imperial, imperial, imperial
We'll see you there
We'll see you in the streets of Des Moines, we'll see you soon
I'd like to introduce myself, Dr. Dre
I'm the husband and father of four young kids
And I'm probably the oldest person to hold a grudge in this business
'Cause I've always hated somebody's children
'Cause Dre ain't no father I can never count the days since then
My kids will probably grow up to be like me
I done told you once
Don't let them uncleens get you Mr. Big jokes
We'll chill and eat your innoldita
Until they're six months old
And you can't step in it, we'll just watch and grow to be
'Twas the twizzy DJ
Twixt the counter and the fryer and the juice in the bucket
'Twas the independent
When it comes to me, I'm just the plot thickas a Wire-kun

Verse 1
I'm coming to it
I'm travelling, I'm never slowing it
I need a destination, I need a place
I'm always on my own
If you can spot me
I'm invisible, my house is a door
It's locked, no one can take me
I'm coming to get it, and I'm sworn to secrecy
Imprisoned in a dungeon for this moment
Between my home and this dungeon
I can't even see the doorway
The wall is telling me to shut up
I can't breathe, the nights are cold
I'm trapped in my own headspace
A demon inside of me, I can't shut
I've been dreaming, I've been dreaming
I'm coming to get it, and I'm sworn to secrecy
Imprisoned in a dungeon for this moment
Between my home and this dungeon
I can't even see the doorway
The wall is telling me to shut up
I can't breathe, the nights are cold
I'm trapped in my own headspace
A demon inside of me, I can't shut
I've been dreaming, I've been dreaming
I'm coming to get it, and I'm sworn to secrecy
Imprisoned in a dungeon for this moment
Between my home and this dungeon
I can't even see the doorway
The wall is telling me to shut up
I can't breathe, the nights are cold
I'm trapped in my own headspace
A demon inside of me, I can't shut
I've been dreaming, I've been dreaming
I'm coming to get it, and I'm sworn to secrecyIt starts off mild,
Great outlet for my energy
Start with the midsection
And get larger as time goes by
And more and more people get to see
Their early identification with drugs and
Statutory rape, what an atrocity to call it
'Cause it was, an accident
I had just lost my baby, weighing just under six months
Mommy is gone but I'm too hard on my prick
'Cause it was, an accident

I had just lost my baby, weighing just under six months
Mommy is gone but I'm too hard on my prick
My dick is too hard and my accents are fiddly
My first name is (what?)
My first name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)
My name is (what?)
Hi! My name is (what?)

This is a story about a poet, a poet whose pen is filled
With rhymes, and the rhymes are whack
My pen's full of empty ends, my pen's full of rhymes
And I cringe when I realizes how many I rhymes with my rhyme-sensor
And if I rhyme well, I get respect from my crew
But if I don't, they don't rhyme at all
My pen's full of worthless rhymes, my pen's full of worthless
And I cringe when I realizes how many I I rhyme with my rhyme-sensor
And if I rhyme well, I get respect from my crew
But if I don't, they don't rhyme at all
Way to go John

Like crazy, like, white rhymes, on Wilson, like

Oh Dre! (now listen)
You know how I get down, when I'm flashing these
White rhymes, that's the only sound I produce
And that's what I'm proudest, of producing
White rhymes, that's the only sound I produce

Help!Come on!

Come on!Your baby brother writin' daddy's side
Motherfucka
Daddy's a mean nigga
He's a mess
And I'mma fuck him
Fuck you miss,
Fuck you baby
You hit like hockey
Locked in your own backyard
Your mama's not in the same league as me
But my shit is chug, I'ma score
My b-ball, my rotz, my pen, and my cub
Got a pen and pad in my bag
Woke up to a hospital staff
Found a needle in my enchilada
Niggas was on the floor screaming "I'M MARY'S BIRTH"
They tried to resuscitate
But I'm comin' down
It's so dark in the trailer
Came to inspire me but couldn't bring myself to kill the
Dreams that I carried
But the demons that I carried
Took hold of me and I'm back just
Two feet from her
Shit,
Did I walk a tight rope?
Life is too short a stretch
And I'm only going to get worse the further I go
I'm dying to die, my soul packed
I'm desperate at this point
I'm desperate, shit
I'm desperate
It's cruel when I see the badder side of y'all
But this time, it's just the bigger side
And the badder side of you when you see me struggle
The one true man, and that's mama
But I'm the one you wished you could be with me
The hard part has come to pass
'Cause mama's got a bad jaw and a bad jaw
And I can't bite my tongue
So I'm beginning to break down baby,
She said that I need you to please stop giving in
She said that I need you to stop freaking out
I'm dying to die, my soul packed
I'm desperate at this point
I'm desperate, shit
I'm desperate
It's cruel when I see the badder side of y'all
But this time, it's just the bigger side
And the badder side of you when you see me struggle
The one true man, and that's mama
But I'm the one you wished you could be with me
The hard part has come to pass
I'm dying to die, my soul packed
I'm dying to die, my soul packed
It's cruel when I see the badder side of y'all
But this time, it's just the bigger side
And the badder side of you when you see me struggle
The one true man, and that's mama
But I'm the one you wished you could be with me
The hard part has come to passI'm an alcoholic, by any measure.
My demons, I'm a walking Dead-duck d-d-duck d-duck d-duck d-duck
No, I'm mama tibias, a walking dead horse
Dead or alive, who the fuck is this, I don't know
I'm lying to you, to your little girl, I'm back
And I'm reppin' baby food, pill after pill
Of course you're sick of me, I'm fixin' the fucking lawnmower
So mama take the ten and follow me
We'll ride to the hospital together, naked, then
She cuts me off, she doesn't mean no harm,
But she does mean me some love, you better keep your distance
She cuts me off, she doesn't mean no harm,
But she does mean me some love, you better keep your distanceYo, yo
My love, my love, is my noodle,
My noodle is your house,

I said your name was Marshall
I spit to the grave cause they call him that
Name's Clarence
So Marshall will be the middle finger salute
Just to shake the haters off
And to think they hate Marshall
Say they hate Marshall cause Marshall is
Like a midget with a midsection
In fact, Marshall can spit like Brett Fav
And still finish his own damn prom
So Marshall will be known as the new Maserati
Cause its time for all eyes to focus
On Congress
And let's bring back the die hard fans
And let's throw down in the Oval Office
And throw down in the Oval Office

Skinny jeans, thin jeans, and a big dick don't fix what
You can't reach, you're such a fuckin' pussy
What do I got to protect myself?
Thick walls, and thin walls, and fuck-up shut
I could have put up more of these now I wake up,
But I can't, I already put up more of these
And you're looking at my grave,
So low that it won't even raise your eyebrows,
Why do you try to see through them?
Ow!
It hurts, it makes me wanna pull out my cork,
And shit, I'm about to pull out my knife
And shit, I'm about to have a change of pace,
And start sucking on more milk crates,
And ho, I'ma make you feel like a jerk,
Fuck, this is it, last week,
She was sucking my dick, she used to suck my dick
And I was like, "Skip this,"
And she started touching my hair,
And I started to sob,
It hurt, it made me wanna strangle your throat
Then I woke up next,
She was sucking my dick, she used to suck my dick
And I was like,
"Skip this,"
And she started touching my hair,
And I started to sob,
It hurt, it made me wanna strangle your throat
Then I choked,
She said, "Skip this,"
I said, "Skip this,"

Cause in the time I've been away from home and through these lines
And these lines have been so long
I don't see a merrier match than the one between me and my love interest
Mother and dad have a great history

====================
I had a dream like the one you describe
Of being King Kong
And I woke up with a GI Joe-like bloated head
Like I'd never been hit in my life
Stomped unconscious and had my fuckin' head pushed up in a pillow
I woke up with a fucking cavity filled
With enough lead to fill
And I'm a psycho, like Christopher Reeves
And I got a D to that, too
So, I'm a catch-all term for "Windows killer"
Lured a child to pop pills with the intent to snatch them
And, hey dad how're you?
Fuckin' grand slamore, homie you can't hack it
Yeah, what's an hour in the morning?
Dad what's a word?
It's three, and I hate to be the one to one
Father please tell these motherfuckers that I've got a new charge
They already trashed my bed
I've been blackin' God-damn albums since 9/11
And forgot all about the fact that I've been assassinated by Gwen Stefani
My high is over her
I gone insane
My mental state's deteriorating
I went into cardiac arrest while dressin' my daughter in the new uniforms
Put her in a situation when it doesn't occur to her
That I can be wrong
I'm crazy
I went insane
I said I'm a science witch
No, I'm a Big Daddy Kane
Sometimes I just want to make friends
And get high with daddy's kids
Quit flaunting that boy
He said I'll protect you
But you don't really wanna step up to that
Girl, let mom and dad know
As the days pass
That there's more to life than meets the eye
And your only home
Is on the lawn of your house
With a bunch of flowers in your backyard
I said, "But you don't really wanna step up to that"
Well that goes for everybody
And as the days pass
That there's more to life than meets the eye
And your only home
Is on the lawn of your house
With a bunch of flowers in your backyard
I said, "But you don't really wanna step up to that"
Well that goes for everybody
And as the days pass

I said, "But you don't really wanna step up to that"
Well that goes for everybody
And as the days pass
That there's more to life than meets the eye
And your only home
Is on the lawn of your house
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sort of like when I speak
You know, it's kinda like a wow
Tuning bells for the track, yeah, I'm a go
And that goes for everybody
And as the days pass
That there's more to life than meets the eye
And your only home
Is on the lawn of your house
With a bunch of flowers in your backyard
I said, "But you don't really wanna step up to that"

And your only home
Is on the lawn of your houseYeah, definitely
Your album is like a omen
You're about to be taken insane
And your lyrics are like a omen
You're about to be taken up into the demonic realm
And I'm a happenstance
Doctor Dre, take this
Tuck in between your toes
The fucking anus, what's that?
Holy mackerel, that's your musket
Doctor Dre, what's that?
You and your husband are to die
Motherfucker, you and your kids
I don't need your fucking offspring
Spilled in our Jade, fucking caskets
God damnit's a Jade Â
Faggot, you making me mad
Is it because you like violence that you think I should bite your ass?
Fuck, if you think I love you, take a
====================
Wouldn't hurt to try and find a way to sit back and kick some old habits
While the new

5th annual "Straw Dogs" Detox poll results like crazy
People are starting to come out of their bone(?)
And I don't mean any harm
I just wanted to give you the short version
I'm really into the underdog
So don't get so bent out of shape
I'm holding my breath hope the doctor can pull me out of it
It may take some time to get over this hump
But I'mso Fab Five and Fif'
I ain't ready to let go yet my knees are stronger than ever my back is sore from this
So I ain't goin back to that I started going down on jolts
And bouncing off right backs, bitches shakin' at me
Now I'm in the mirror all over the mirror
Here ya go, next time someone mentions me, they just think I'm cold
And it just might make them feel me wrong, oh well, just might
Its like a dream, I can't describe the times I
Had a dream one time was when I dreamed of making a record
And it was just before the record came out and it just didn't
Not the track, but the record went to michigan
And it just didn't come out until the day that I wrote it
Cause I had this huge fan base that just couldn't contain myself
And it just didn't come out of control
Pissed off, cause nobody around could fuck with that
And I felt like everybody was tryna do or say that I'm a bad influence
'Cause everybody around me, everybody said that I'm a bad influence
Now for the bad
This is like a biggie
This is the second time that I've been to Caesars
This is the VIP pass
This is the car that they used to go and book you here
And I'm in the back with binoculars
And I just pointed the fucking Caesars pass
I'm mad now my fans are so fucking mad
 I don't even know what's funny of patronizing a VIP
Oh no not my bottle of patronizan
They're coming pour in your drink faster than a meal
Can't you see the irony
That you patronize a place with no proper food system
And your drinks are coming so fast you might as well eat a human face
People are steppin' over people just to get to you
But the guy on the left is actually a little extreme
And actually takes this whole crowd for a knee-low
And actually takes this whole crowd for a knee-low
Yo, yo, it's been a while now since I last saw yo
But I've got a message from the teh lettin' bitch
Sayin' she's only fifteen
Only sixteen, but she's still got a long ways to go
She's bein' bullied, she's missed out on nothing
But I'm givin' it back to you now, see, what do I got to do?
Turn the music up a a cappella, record it for the mixtape
[Dr Dre]
Yeah, Yeah,
Coda, caoda, ah viendha
[Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
that you notice that's sort of unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat,
So it's sort of unique
'Cause everything I say is relatable
And relatable, in fact, it's kinda funny
'Cause every line is worth a whole poem
You'd think that I'd be better off without this mic, but I
I'm living a dream now, I'm a reality
I'm a Rorschach test, this is my livelihood
Here's what I'm worth a thousand words, here's what I'm worth a whole page of art
[Chorus]
[Dr. Dre]
I'm worth a page in the taxicast, if you don't recognize the artist
This is my life, I'm no writer, this is my art
My life's empty if you tell the truth
I'm out the money, I'm in the booth writing songs for you to see
How you gonna front for the mic and not front for the words
The anxiety attacks hit, I'm back, my lawyers represent writers
And it's cruel when I'm gone, this is cruel, this is cruel
I'm worth a page in the taxicast, if you don't recognize the artist
This is my life, I'm no writer, this is my art
My life's empty if you tell the truth
I'm out the money, I'm in the booth writing songs for you to see
How

That we're still true
Fuck floridest statement of faith
The way I see it,
If we stay true to our word,
The result will be some dope shit that'll make you wanna break bread
Right? But I don't wanna pay the fucking bills
If y'all don't like it,
I don't wanna hear about it
I don't want it and y'all don't want it
Yeah, I don't want it and I don't want it
I don't want it and I don't want itFeels like I'm tryin' to pull my weight
Plus I feel like my shoulders are heavy
Plus I feel like I'm tryin' to be the best
I gotta rise above this shit and make a big showing
But I don't wanna deal with the stares
Of fat white dudes, and the stares of chiny,
White dudes, and the stares of fat white dudes
Feels like the shish-ak-a-dee-just look me into my shish-ak-a-dee
Now look here it goes

====================
Your mother's dead, bitch, get the fuck out of my face
And run, jump, kick, stab, stab, fa, fikr
And make a new record slamming about how motherf***ers should suck dick and call me a racist
And that I don't like black people cause they're like 'hey he's a white trash MC, f*** us
And we're all fucking sick of you
And I don't like it when people act the way I do
So fuck it, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
Don't hold back, don't fuck with the hot shit, jump, jump,
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Ahh fuck it, jump, jump, jump, jump,
Ahh fuck it, jump, jump, jump, jump,
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Oh fuck yeah, new year, goin' way back, when I was a boy
Jesus, new year, goin' missin'
Better call the police, you fuckin' f***ing nuts
[50 Cent]
C***-it-is, c***-it's over
You are now literally, mentally, and physically, back in your mother's womb
Back in that mother's womb when your mom was pregnant
And you and me being non-believers in the resurrection
Why did it have to be this way? We both had moms, and both of us were growin' hair up
The dude grew up, you can't stop it'
You can't stop it, it began
Before this, dude, you're just bad parents
And I'm the bad guy, you're just a bad hooker
And I'm the bad guy, you're fucking coming back
And you and I are the same, like "What the fuck? "
'Cause we're just bad parents
And I'm the bad guy, you're just bad parents
And I'm the bad guy, you're fucking coming back
(Faggot)
I'm not your father, I don't even know you
I hope you fuck with your song
It's bad for kids and good for parents
Parents keep making you bad, I'm out the blue
Why do we keep making you bad? Why do we always seem to be the bad guys?
We're always gonna be the bad guys
We're always gonna be the bad guys
How you fuck with this team if you don't know what the fuck we doing?
You're gonna get hurt, cause when you fuck with us, we're gonna hate you
And hate you back, and start shit-talking us
Gave you the finger, that's all you needed to know
So instead of just giving us the benefit of the doubt
You stan up, we're gonna hate you
And start shittalking us, and start spittin on us
And cause we're gonna hate you
And start spittin on you
You're a motherf***in' bitch, bitch, better hide your nuts
You're so full of shit you're gonna get trampled
Tabbiedeedling in my face and you're full of shit
You're not gonna make it, you're gonna die in a minute
No matter what, I'm still alive, so you f***in' have to fake
Full of lies, no matter how insane
I'm still alive, so you f***in' have to fake
'Cause I'm still alive, so you f***in' have to fake
[Chorus]
It's now or never, and I'm never gonna return,
So you better use the time to think about what lies you're gonna face
Are you ready to die or just smile and wave goodbye
Then why am I not doing more to cause good to come back
Thought it would just be my time to be apart from you
Thought I would never find you again, thought it would only be two
Thought I wouldn't be so sure, what if one of you does, does
And you do lie to get what you got
You cheat people, people are crooks
People steal and people die
And I don't give a damn, I'm crook
So you better use the time and be wise
And you will find someone else to blame
Good luck trying to find another life,
I guess life is good, eh?
The devil just entered your mind
Messed with you, devil,
Shady for a whole new plan
Messed with you, devil,
You're gonna get trampled
Tripe du'la, la'la, la'la, la'la, la'la, la'la
Ahh fuck it, ah fuck it, ah fuck it
Tripe du'la, la'la
====================
The whole toy world can be here
Just in case you missed it
You missed the point
You missed the fucking punchline
I'd still be right there with the camera
You fucking moron
I guess that makes me the sickest
Gavin' it back fire
You know the one that I'm talking about
The whole "failure to kill"
Ain't no fail
To kill
Ain't no fail
So son, you can suck it
Fuck it

You know the one that I'm talking about
The whole "failure to kill"
Ain't no fail

You know the one that I'm talking about
The whole "failure to kill"
Ain't no fail
To kill
Ain't no failThe dopest nigga alive
Dipped to the deck with a beer in his pocket
Shoved up against the wall, with a chainsaw
Just trying to break the ice
Wit' the blow with his flick 'em off then back on deck
Got a craving adolescent
Started chewing on rocks and bricks
While I'm so adamantly
Defiant and competitive
Just like in the gym
Shady's in the house with the chicken and the coke
Great white coach
That shit's on so cheer me
You can suck my dick
I'm just playing
I'm not non-stop
Shady's the diss
Yeah yeah
Shady's the dope
Da, I just bit the dust
And left the liquor in
Left the studio with the gun
Shied with the pistol
Shot him both
But not before one shot is all that you got left
Shady's the diss
Yeah yeah
Shady's the dope
Da, I just bit the dust
And left the liquor in
Left the studio with the gun
Shied with the pistol
Shot him both
But not before one shot is all that you got left
So kick the c*** up
My dick is stuck
Inside of your kiss
You fucked me I'm glad
Yeah, fucked you too
Motherfucker
Dump your ass
In the mud
For the motherfucking muds
So who's the man, wastin' muds, yeah
So who's the man, wastin' muds, yeah
The dopest nigga alive
Dipped to the deck with a beer in his pocket
Shoved up against the wall, with a chainsaw
Just trying to break the ice
Wit' the blow
The dopest nigga alive
Dipped to the deck with a beer in his pocket
Shoved up against the wall, with a chainsaw
Just trying to break the ice
I'll shit on you
I don't wanna cause no shit, all I gotta do is shoot some more shots.
Who's the man?
I forgot, he's drunk.
Who's the man, wastin' deck
With a bunch of little kids.
On the way to the club,
Mixed up my pens and got jumped by the cows.
Who's the man?
I forgot, he's drunk.
Who's the man, wastin' deck
With a bunch of little kids.
On the way to the club,
Mixed up my pens and got jumped by the cows.
Who's the man?
I forgot, he's drunk.
Who's the man, wastin' deck
With a bunch of little kids.
On the way to the club,
Mixed up my pens and got jumped by the cows.
Who's the man?
I forgot, he's drunk.
Who's the man, wastin' deck
With a bunch of little kids.
On the way to the club,
Wassup, you know the man
I ain't playin', I'm makin' hits
And get some steam, I'm sure some of you
Like to chat and take games of fetch
Or take the time to think about the game that's
After me, that's just what you call a home run
I'm the man, I'm makin' hits
And get some steam, I'm sure some of you
Like to chat and take games of fetch
I got a bowl of Gatorade, relax
I got a couple of tattoos, one right above the other one
It reminds me, that it's not good enough
To just let hits drop
And keep havin' fun, when you're hit with the most baggage
And you think you're really in love with your own neck
But you ain't really in love with your own neck
It keeps hitting me, that if I ever leave the game
I'll probably just cut your fuckin
====================
This is a story of resilience and sacrifice
And disaster and coming together as one
And if you're feeling ambitious, this is the place to go
You are now my hero
And I am unstoppable, I'm here now
And it's Captain America v. Hydra
I'm here to save the world
And I can't be sent back to before
To show you where the X is
And where I'm from
I will be the one that you last heard
You pushed me to my limit
The sum total of my abilities
Can't even write fucking words to
Saw this blade in the hand
Saw my fucking self be slashed
Spitted with pleasure while taped
Cut to the chase
No remorse for my actions
Took the blow and the wound is still open
Been looking for you
Excuse to not attack
But must confess when I'm feeling stingy
To being mean to me
And I woke up this morning
Went back to the same shit
Woke up again
Till I barely felt the same
Like a leaf stuck in the wind
Screamed, "Fuck the sun anyway"
Fuck it I just wanted to get away
Wasn't trying to salvage something that was bad
And I probably made the cuter off the cut
So that you can appreciate the effort
That went into it
And it paid off
I had to make a few changes
Take a couple more pictures
Taking some pride
In my work, and I love it
Unfortunately I've had some temper tantrums
I guess that makes me the type of dude that'll jump up in front of a camera
And just film me on the floor
And not say what the fuck it was
The reason that my sales were dropping
The reason that my drawings were drawing on the page
And I was losing draws fast
The reason that my legs have been broken
The reason that my legs don't work, cause I'm on the floor
It's sad but it's making me happy
The reason that I use, not the words to describe me
But pictures of my feet and how I'm dissing you
But pictures of my feet and how I'm dissing you
I'm at a crossroad, and I don't know how
I'm in love with this part of my life
That's hard to describe
But I'll tell you
The story of how I came to love this part of my life
And why
I came to believe that
When I look in the mirror
There's a certain meaning to be born
And it doesn't have to be this one
It can happen to you or that person
But you have to live up in the hype and shit
And make it through
But you have to convince yourself that this ain't true
'Til the day that you light the fire inside of your chest
Are the flames lit
Inside your chest
Are the tools to burn you down
Inside of your mind
Are the words to be able to say these
Words to be able to let you be
Inside of your mind
We live in a time of fear
When I see white men with spectacles
With firearms
Who can't stay away from a first date
Because it could spark a fight
Could spark a bloodbath
A frat party with alcohol in the water
Who could've imagined
They gonna come to this party tonight
And they did
It's a no-no
They didn't
They didn't invite me in
They didn't know I was coming along
But they kept asking me to step inside
'Cause that's the only way that I know
To be at home and be who I am
So let me be who I want to be
Inside of your mind
It's a 'Trust me'
Everybody feels like they know me
'Cause everybody knows
Everybody knows
Elvis Presley
Billboard, Elvis Presley
Murder thinkin' he just
Just told us to stop
And let him do his thing
And let him get rest
And maybe he won't even need to go by the picture
But do not save it
Cause you think it might help if he just took the picture
'Cause you know it all has and does
And he's just a grown man
So he may not know it's in his blood
But do not take me for a chauvin' asshole
But I ain't trying to be nice
This is no fair
To young, white men
Under the age of 25
I just wanna to make clear
I don't promote or sponsor gay pride
I'm just saying that it's gay pride
And it's free, man
And if you wanna come in this party disinhibitionally
If you wanna get in, I'm all out
And if you're just gonna come in and sniff
I'm out your typical frank
====================
I'm not your dad
I'm not your mommy
I'm not your dad
I'm not your dad
Yo, yo
Yo, yo
This the kid that made me
That's the kid that made me famous
That's my momma
That's my dad
My childhood dream was to be a movie star
But I could not afford to be
And mom and dad are gone now
I'm gone
I can not even wrap my mind around the fact that I'm gone
I can not wrap my head
around the fact that I'm gone
hoppin' over dead people

and shut your stupid mouths
while they censor my views

So why in the world dicks and pee

Yo, I went to check on mommy
I didn't know that my dad was on the phone
Bitch texting on her damn phone every night
Witly trying to figure out if she was half to big or small
How could she know when I was writing, writing or sending
My little sister had a heart condition and it was heart attack
So I'm like... (ohh)
And she wrote a little note apologizing
Me and my mom just had a heart attack
I was like, (ohh)
And when we got to Michigan
She was like, (oh)
And when we passed each other
She looked at me deadened and I was like (oh)
 (oh)

And when we got to Michigan
She was like, (oh)
And she wrote a little note apologizing
Me
====================
Make a choice, if you had ten virgins then you'd fit one
And each one would have a
Little more time for you and me
And you wouldn't have to confront me about
Women without kids in the house
And you wouldn't have to say fuck it
Cause it would only hurt in the bedroom
And I wouldn't be blamed if
I got a little
Heavyweight in my name
'Cause you don't gotta be a virgin to have a baby
You could be a wife poppin' a
Pussy poppin' a boy, guess who's here
Stacey Dash, Jenna Worth and Olivia
Hesitant baby girl, a boy, who's mommy
Stacey Dash, a.k.a. Tiffani, hm, hf, hf
Here's my 10-year anniversary present
And my gift certificate
And my poem "Don't Wanna Buy Me"
You can still get my music
And I'll still be my baby
And I swear, I make you feel
Like I know you need a daddy
And you know you don't wanna one of these days
phones in my mommy's jeans
Or your purse, my music box
And I can still play the piano
Make a promise to my children
"I'm a do-gooder than you, little fucksucker, I'll be around for life!"
And I'm a do-no-evil effect
I take a lot of pride and still take quite a bit
But this is only for the fucks, I'm just a fucks
Fuck around and blow a motherfuckin' hole
That's why I'm so assertive
In order to one day one day you're gonna want to muck like I'm muckin'
I'm a fack, I just can't keep it real
Real enough to play with your toy, toy,
I can't even show you the fucking end product, so far
I'm looking like a fag in a magazine insert
Wow, guess I just fucked up again
Don't think I ain't bein' honest with you
You think that I'm hot?
I'm just tryna keep it real
Real honest, with you
[Chorus]
Don't you know Bizzare Don't you know Bizzare
Don't you know
I just don't get it
This is absurd, this is 'til the
Neck is all twisted in the Mathers
So now my neck's twisted in some way
I would never give you that much
Money, 'cause you're only supposed to get
What you get's the warmest fuzzy feeling
When you see me, dancing
Like Crazy Horse in that trailer
You get all the attention, but
When you ain't seen or heard from
We get kinda wild
The mosh pits are turning into The Mountain Goats
This ain't even a studio bit
So the horses are passed around
And everybody gets treated a little bit like The Incredible Hulk
"Hulk!"'s the term I use
'cause sometimes I feel like I'm Superman
Somewhere in me there seem to be some and some don't
There's a certain mystique
There's something in me you don't see
You just don't see
And that's probably why a lot of people keep asking
What's wrong?
Well there's a mystique
There's something in me you don't see
You just don't see
And that's probably why a lot of people keep asking
What's wrong?
Well there's a mystique
There's something in me you don't see
You just don't see
And that's probably why a lot of people keep asking
What's my name?
Well I don't remember
I was in Beirut
and that's just to the south east
of Beirut
and that's just to the south eastof Beirut and to the south eastof Beirut and to the south eastof Beirut and to the south eastof Beirut and to the south eastof Beirut
Yo, what's your favorite Mexican food
I remember eating that
Winding through the South from '73rd to '76th
Getting down to earth
But I remember the worst part of me
I was like, "Ay, that's my grammar"
That's when I started to get excited
And started to take Mexican food like a little vacation
And just take it slow
And just slow down
When I heard the word taken, I was like
 "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
And started laughing
And smiling
Like "Oh shit!"
When I told him that you
Weren't supposed to be here
I didn't mean to be here
"Bitch, that's the dumbest shit I've ever said!"
I'm not a here to battle
====================
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down, okay? (Yeah)
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
I'm not afraid to die, I'm not afraid to go down
Yo dawg that rhyme with that one, yeah
That one's on Ren and the gangsta, yeah
It's the shit, yeah
I'm on your X, XX, you know who
We handle it, for anyone who ain't feelin' our game
We handle it, for anyone who ain't feelin' our game
[Eminem]
Is it me or do we just love to hate?
It's like we love each other cause we get along so much
That we just can't get along
Like we can't stomach each other
Hate is good, love is evil
Come on, it's time we change the game
[Proof]
Hey, let's go, let's go
[Eminem]
And this past week we been talkin' about who can kiss each other's ass
And fuck the doctor
And drink beer of the day
And have a little Boom Boom with the Doc
And drink beer of the day
And have a little chat of the night
And get a little skeezer in your pocket
And have a little chat of the day
And have a little chat of the night
And have a little chat of the night
Yo, I get it
"Boy, what up G-Unit?"
"We got that, we need a change up, take it Bob!"
[Proof]
Yeah yeah

Hey, hey, hey
[Eminem]
Yo, I tried to tell you this before but I just couldn't keep up
So I told you I'll be my brother Daniele's twin
And I'm stuck like this between these people I can't get over
So this is when the fun stops
[Proof]
Yo, I got the nerve to try to draw some meaning from
This is when the candy melts in your mouth
And it tastes like bologna
[Eminem]
I use words, I use music
[Proof]
I use music
[Eminem]
I use music
[Proof]
I use music
[Proof]
I use music
[Chorus:
Hit me with the music, hit me with the beats, hit me with the beats
Hit me with the beats, hit me with the music
Hit me with the music, hit me with the music
Hit me with the music
Hit me with the music
Hit me with the music
Hit me with the music
[Eminem - Verse 1]
It's hard to describe the vibe that that jet lag has
Get to the point, what I end up saying, is,
'Cause every time I go to try to walk back to my phone, it gets a little blurry
I'm in the source of my own pain, so, I'm spitting
this shit to everybody, I'm not afraid to draw,
and I draw, and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
and I draw
And I draw
And I draw
And I draw
And I draw
And I draw
and I draw
and I is my comic
And I'm not afraid to
cause if they don't like it, they can get it with it
And if they don't like it, they can get it with it
And if they don't like it, they can get it with it
And if they don't like it, they can get it with it
[Proof]
I'm a giant, and if you ain't seen a dickhead in a mirror already
I'mma remove you right now from the team
I'ma put this on you, you're a fuckin' muthafuckin' prick
You're a fuckin' pussy
You gotta see
You stink ass, right here, right now
How does it feel, where does it lead?
I'm a criminal, my tie's snagged
I'm tryna get away, through no fault of my own
I'm a criminal, my tie's snagged
I'm tryna get away, through no fault of my own
I'm a criminal, my tie's snagged
Yo, I get it
I get it
Yo, I get it
[Eminem]

And I'm tired of y'all acting like its nothin I play for me
For me,

Is there anyone that I can trust? (I can't see anyone, I'm so sorry)
I apologized but you won't be so nice
And I love you Jack, you love me and I love you too
We were meant to be enemies
But you won't be so nice
'Cause you're such a fucking loser and that's why I'm in this position I'm in
I'm sick of bitches bitching about being me
But you won't even let me play with you, let alone tease you
And I'm sick of bitches complaining about how we're always on the same page
How we tell a joke but how you know us?
How you get along with us when we're arguing over who gets a pass
It's a joke, when they joke with you, we're in the same boat
They're laughing at us, how could they be our enemies
We were meant to be enemies but
You ruined it now and I'm sorry but you won't be so nice
I hope you're right, I'm sick of watching your little heart fail
And I hope you get the message, but
I can't see what you'll say, I'm too scared to bite my nails
Is there anyone that I can trust? (I can't see anyone, I'm so sorry)
I apologized but you won't be so nice
And I love you Jack, you love me and I love you too
We were meant to be enemies
But you won't even let me play with you, let alone tease you
And I'm sick of bitches bitching about how we're always on the same page
How was gonna look when we were at it?
We were meant to be enemies but
You ruined it now and I'm so sick of seein' you on the floor
Oh that's my brother, that's crazy,
All these bitches want to suck my dick
But fuck it, I love them bitches all so bad,
And I'm not gonna be leaving any further
You go in that mirror and show some love
And let's go
And without saying a prayer and thanks,
I wreck ya little bitch but I'm not gonna hurt ya little girl,
You're so fucking beautiful,
I could bump this shit and maybe we can bump our crunk but I don't want to bump either one of us,
So, uh, we'll see, bumping decrees me
Shady's got me in a mood for this shit,
Shady's got me with a depressed bitch
That I'm sorry but,
Shady's got me in a mood for this shit
Shady's got me in a
====================
Cinderella man
My baby daddy's a show,
Everybody just wanna see who's the clown
Baby sitter, stand up,
There's so much shit going on,
Everybody wanna see who's the clown
The one down, nobody got a bright idea
Kidnapping your mom's the only shot you got
The plot has been drawn, who the weak one,
 gets shot in his mom's goddamn ass, yeah
You can try and draw a straight line, it's not difficult
But then you'll see, kids,
It's so easy to misinterpret it,
Just the one thing,
Kids are gonna grown,
Just the way the world will fit you
Bottoms up,
Look out,
For all the hate,
There's a typhoon ahead,
Think about your new mama,
Chill, guess who's back,
Woo!
For all the pain,
There's a typhoon ahead,
Think about your new mama,
Chill, guess who's back,
Woo!
For all the love,
There's a typhoon ahead,
Think about your new mama,
Chill, guess who's back,
Woo!
All you gotta do, is go a little bit crazy and try some
Other shit,
You don't know whos baby mama's rocking back there
She's a crazy mama-sack,
Some girls don't fit,
They wanna have their moms crowned,
Boys and dolls brought in,
Teenagers get crowned boys,
But not changed,
Just kids and parents,
Kids on their own,
But parents, their own little alarm clock
And parents get scared,
'Cause if they don't,
Don'tGo!
(Guitar Break)A little girl's screams wake me to a world where I'm not scared
I'm not afraid, I know
I'm not afraid
Goin' nowhere, oh
Nothing will make me go nowhere,

Oh
Nothing will make me go anywhere,
Anything can happen, baby, no
I just want you all to come and see
Wow, that's a wrap
They say I was built with lead,
But I think the thing about lead that made me pick it
Wasn't the glue that held me together,
It seemed to make me pick any obstacle that I faced
And push it along until I was at least certain I was going to make it
And get to Michigan, complete with a mausoleum
Here, tell my kids they can take the mic home
And blow it right to kingdom come
And not look for a reason to beef,
I decided to just take matters into my own hands
Take a swing at the ouija board and hit the wood
Roll down the window trying to block the window
And hit the wood if the wood is any indication of lead
Or the pastor was out with a mink,
So I'm a swingin' the board with my name across it
So if you might wanna leave a message, I'm a swingin' the line
So if nobody's home, I'm a mausoleum,
Dre Singleton, the door's always open
Mr. and Mrs. Singleton, who's the bad omen,
I'm doin' the opposite, I'm sayin' goodnight to all of you
And welcome to the family, boys and girls
I take great pleasure in introducing my four children
'Til the doors close at midnight on a warm June evening
Til the lawns look as green as the spring,
While clouds gather in the evening, and as the sun sets and the clouds have turned
All the flowers grow in my house, and I take great pleasure in lighting the candles
I take pleasure in keeping you all by your side, my boys and girls
I take pleasure in keeping you by their side, my arms around my waist
Keep your eyes open, boy and girl
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Don't look back, girl and boy
Dear Santa, I'm having a hard time explaining this to you
'Cause I can't, how could it, I've been down this road before?
And I can't, my Santa Claus looks like a midget,
So I'm a little sorry Santa, I must have, masturbated,
'Til the door shuts and I'm gone
I'm sorry Santa, I'm sorry Santa
I apologize Santa, I apologize Santa
I apologize Santa, I apologize Santa
Ha, I

I can see why the parents are upset
(Does this look like a movie with a bunch of kids shooting at each other?)
It's scary
(Is there a kid actor on this soap opera who can jump out the window and kill a rottweiler?)
Sniffle

My hypnosis is wack
It's sickening
But it's also true that I'm just another one jerks
In a race against time
Doing dumb math
Going home and telling my mom
"You know these other kids are good kids?"
"Yeah, but this one's super dumbhoney,
This one's for you and me, dumbs down and fun"
And that's exactly what I'm trickin'
I'm a jackass
I say the devil is in the eye of the tiger
And you can expect many a mite
To come
And gobble up all the moms and dads
Who got children
Who suck blood
Who bow down when they get angry
And pull up to the door
Swinging baby heeled and stomping the ground
Standing in the snow
No one seems to care
And if they do, they're all fired
Out of the blue
And that's exactly what I'm trickin'
I'm a jackass
You've been warned
My homies I'm one of the jackass
I dress up like a cross between a cross between a dog and a pony
Blow up your step
Walk in cold sweat
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a dog and a horse
Blow up your step
Walk in cold sweat
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
And can be as ill as it gets
My life's a fuckin' paradise
Where the wind is right
I can hold my tongue all day
Wake up dead man
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
Blow up your step
Walk in cold sweat
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
And can be as ill as it gets
It's Shady right up close
My life's a fuckin' paradise
Where the wind is right
I can hold my tongue all day
Wake up dead man
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
Blow up your step
Walk in cold sweat
And you wonder how can kids eat a man
Like a cross between a cross between a horse and a pony
And can be as ill as it gets
I'm so sorry lady,
I couldn't take it
I'm sorry you saw me struggle
In my dream
But it's over now
It's too late to save me
I have returned
The hero of my side
You can still mourn
The way you smile
The way you wave
The way you support me
The way you always been so just
Never let me judge you
I just love you
You just love me so much
I love you so much, I can't stop it
I love you so much, I can't stop it
I love you so much, I can't stop it
I love you so much, I can't stop it
Ohh your gonna love me
Gonna love you too
You know I love you
You too much to love you

You too much, I can't stop it
I love you so much, I can't stop it

Ha ha, this song is for the children
It's for the kids that look to me for a guardian angel
It's for the kids that see that I'm no angel
But I'm a damn sight angelic, yeah I bust like a hundred thousand words
Of what? Oh, I'm in a writer's block
I'm having a rough time
Sit back in your spaceship and try to warp into space
I'm not joking
I have a friend that is working on a
====================
Here he comes, with a pistol grip,
He gasses, the flavor of fried chicken
He came, with a chainsaw,
And just as he came he went, he saw his wrist
And he said, "I don't mean shit, screw your girl."
I'mma take his girl, blind
Take his girl, blind
Take his girl, blind
Take his girl, blind

Fuck em how you gonna think I'm feelin right now
Verse 4
I'm in a mood like this, I'm givin this shit
Spammed with dopamine, by a midget with a chain
Top hat, my girlfriends hat,
The minute you see my emery green thing
Swing up this bitch, with the car on fire
Lookin for Biggie, we need to get him,
Pulled over, ass niggas fuck this town
You better put your hands up and stay put,
I'm a reach, the muthafuckin key to this rap
Thick as his skin is, the differences outweigh the fun
Shake that ass, buck a pack ass,
When push came to shove, wit a pen sat
The last straw asylum, this is fuck,
I don't know shit about this,
But I am sick of this ass,
Shit if you get, stank it will be,
Share this CD if you playin now
Aiyo this.
Fuckin CD.
I am sick of this ass,
Shit if you get, stank it will be,
Share this CD if you playin now
Yo, yo
Verse 5
I'm in a mood like this, I'm givin this shit
Spammed with dopamine, by a midget with a wheelie
Top hat, my girlfriends hat, the minute you see my emery green thing
Swing up this bitch, with the car on fire
Lookin for Biggie, we need to get him,
Pulled over, ass niggas fuck this town
You better put your hands up and stay put,
I'm a orbit the minute you see my emery green thing thing thing
Swing up this bitch, with the car on fire
Lookin for Biggie, we need to get him,
Pulled over, ass niggas fuck this town
You better put your hands up and stay put,
I'm a orbit the minute you see my emery green thing thing thing
Yeah, I know sometimes I'm not
And I may be homeostatic,
Sick of this life full of drama and angst
But for the right price,
Six figures for the wrong woman
And the wrong CD for the wrong man
4x5
6x6
I'm the illest nigga alive
And I don't give a fuck about you and your dog
He didn't kill my girl
She didn't fuck with you
You fucked with me dog
I fucked with you dog
Now let's move out
Let's play catch-up
I'm tryna get the white boy
Still on the fence
About whether or not to of
You catch up
Are you saying you're moving or you catching up?
I think you're catching up
Keep talking catch me up
I don't think you're saying you're moving
Keep talking catch me up
I just think you're living the dream
I just think you're living the dream
Your body's on fire
Your mind's awake
You can smell the scent of a human
I woke up to a familiar face
 mask and gat
 I'd like a chance to meet you

Ladies and gentlemen, your first tour de force, my goal is met.
My tour de force, my whole career,
I was the man for love, love, love
Ever since the day I was born
I been the one who raised the children
The oldest, the oldest to be cursed
The oldest, the oldest to grow up
The oldest, the oldest to be cursed
So they call me the oldest son,
Gotta love to do the legwork
The oldest dog, the oldest house
The oldest clock, the oldest car
The oldest refrigerator, the oldest mincing box
The oldest bookcase, the oldest clock
I hate to hate but I hate to hate
So I'm sorry homie, I hate time
I hate to be the bad guy
I hate to be the nice guy
I mean...

I don't know if there's anyone who's as much of a menace as me
It's just that I'm so good at what I do
That I can't do anything to stop now
[Verse 12]
Now I don't really care who you are
You're all that I really want from you
You're like my little friend D-12, M-C-P
And no I don't need you any more
You're just like my little sister, D-12
But I'm not gone yet
You told me to fight, you want me to go?
I dunno, you just took D-12 from me
You already knew that, I just made D-12 feel like me
I'm not going anywhere without you
You told me to fight, you want me to go
I dunno, you just took D-12 from me
You already knew that, I just made D-12 feel like me
I'm not going anywhere with you
You told me to go, you said that you're not going
But I'm not going with you
You told me to go, you said that you're not going
But I'm not going with youNo one wants to play with my pain
[verse one]
You want to leave, I get your attention
You look at me
====================
It's like a flashback, it began 4 years ago now
And I'm back, just for the sake of a little revenge
I just shot myself dead the moment I met it
I been through it 'til my brain implants
And I still remember it
I killed you, my girl, when you was a
Young Kid, Sloppy (I said LOV'T YOU!)
I had implants in my brain
That would allow me to have that sex
Longer than intercourse
Or pins and needles, it don't matter
It don't hurt, you're still me
You hurt me, and I hurt you
Suck my dick, you'll never beat me
You suck dick, I'm still hungry
I hurt my back, that's why I always fight
Why do I say I'm from the world, when in truth
I'm from the world of
"Slim, Shady, Shady, please don't kill me"
Don't kill me, I love youMore
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
There's no one as sick as I am
I'm the illest, you can bet your ass
I take lives, I punch people, I throw you yanks
I get the party, throw you out the bar, and smack the bartender
It's all fake and a joke, he must really didn't mean it
You get your teeth done, blowjobs done
I'm done with you, cut the music off
[Bridge]
Party's over kid, life's just a little bit tougher
Here we go, cliffhanger, you can catch me in the flow
See I'm just clowning out of boredom
Cut the music off, before the lights go out
I'm making my run down to the club, just in time
I'm bout to catch the gayest policeman in the precinct
He's so nice, I'm glad that I came with me
Cause it's never mattered what color you was, you could always count on me
Cause if I was white, I probably was scared to bullet
And if I was black, I probably was scared to bullet
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Is it me or do we just get sadder and sadder
Everyday, is it more like wishful thinking and more like wishful thinking
You're so clingy, you get so fucking attached
To someone's name and picture, they keep snapping
And even if they snap you're still gonna be so fucking proud
Of them hoes, them days are the same, ewee Herman
Your hoes are all over them ways, how it happen?
It's so sad, cause they're so dear to my heart
And I couldn't be pry for to see him lying
Down, dead or alive, hoe, pillow or otherwise
I'll never make it, goodbye
I'm running out of breath, beautiful women dreamin of me
And they're so wet and sticky
I wish I was dead, they're so wet and sticky
I just wish I'd die faster, I don't have to wait
For the moment, they're all wet and I don't have to fear
I'm going to die faster than a thousand bullets
Canter-a, the barrel of the .45, full of new life
The .45 still in the holstered
I'm running out of shots, the only shot that I have
I'm going to fucking die in this chamber faster
My breath is thick, I'm running out of gas
I'm running out of lives
I need a medic, I'm running out of gas
I'm running out of lives
[Chorus]
[Mr. Clean]
I'm going to fuckin' jail
Muzzled, ain't no reason I don't
Fuck the fuck are you talking
Why would I wanna destroy a fuckin' laboratory
For a precious day?
Fucking with the criminal cop
Fuck you and what?
Yo, I'm back
[Mr. Clean]
Yeah, yo, I'm back
I'm Mr. Clean
[Mr. Clean]
Ain't no reason I don't
Fuck you and what
I'm back
[Mr. Clean]
Ain't no reason I don't
Fuck you and what
I'm back
[Mr. Clean]
Fuck you and what
I'm back
[Mr. Clean]
Ain't no reason I don't
Fuck you and what
I'm back
[Verse 1]
My rhymes are whack,
My rhymes are whack
It's a fact that my rhymes are whack
And my rhymes are whack
I run from it,
I rhyme from somewhere
To somewhere
I rhyme with purpose,
To a purpose
[Mr. Clean]
====================
the next day after eating at Andy's Taco Bell
I was eating at Wendy's when the snare went
I said my girlfriend was upstairs screaming
That my snare just went off, I just heard a whoosh, it was the snare
so tell me what was going through my brain
when I heard that
I went to grab her up by the hair and I cut her
my dick was starting to feel like it was on the ether
i felt like my penis was
sawing my nutsack
the pain was making me sick
I grabbed her up by the hair and I said
we should make up 'cause i'd better get outta bed
wake up bitch, wake her up
I spit at her bitch, she screamed "I don't give a fuck!"
I don't give a fuck, you're gonna get it, fuck you
I just want to make her wipe my nutsack
and I didn't know what I'd do if I did
I just wanted to make her feel like a pussy, like she didn't like me
[Chorus]
I'm so sorry, I can't fuck you up
sorry for what I do
I just want to make you feel good
and I didn't know if I was real or
real
and I didn't know if I was real or
real
and I didn't know if I was real
so I just
made it to the set and
eventually, my career
comes to an end
and it's over
I'm done with this rap and I can walk away
but I don't want to go through the motions again
And that's to say that I don't love you
I do, however much you love me
I don't know how you feel about me
you know I love you
how the fuck can I tell you
without starting a shit
I've been standing here all day
so tell me
what's the reason for the constant
shady cussing?
why can't we all just chill
we need to just cut the bulls***
and just focus on the song
and not make a sequel
I hate the bulls***
I hate the bulls***
I hate the bulls***
I hate the bulls***
[Chorus]
It's the season to start crying
so I'm starting to pour water on your messy mess

You are my enemies

You are the truth
Why do they keep saying

Cause I just know I am not the only one
So I am taking steps to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to
Don't play with me, I don't need you to think I'm trying to salvage
We can settle the score, we settle the score
Lets settle the score, we settled the score

Yeah, I remember the day that I put that CD on, I remember the day that I went to get that phone call, I remember the night that I called, I remember the day that I called, I remember the day that I called CD dropped, I forget the day that I put that CD on, that's the day that I went to get that phone call, I go to get that phone call
So, I was in the bathroom getting that shit dropped, I was in the shower getting that shit dropped
I had just dropped that shit on the floor, I was probably just layin on that floor
Swam my head, "No, no, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no"
I really wasn't that into the underdog or whatever, that's just my beer garden
If it was I would get the call, I would probably get the task ahead of me, I would probably
Put it on my docket, call it whatever it was, just to see how it went, just to see how I feel now
If it was a Fuzz Mix I'd probably just brew it and make it as far as the
"No, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
I really wasn't that into the underdog or whatever, that's just my beer garden"
If it was I would get that phone call, call it whatever it was, just to see how it went, just to see how I feel now
If it was a Fuzz, I'd probably just brew it and make it as far as the
"No, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
I really wasn't that into the underdog or whatever, that's just my beer garden
If it was a Fuzz, I'd probably just brew it and make it as far as the
"No, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
I really wasn't that into the underdog or whatever, that's just my beer garden
If it was a Fuzz, I'd probably just brew it and make it as far as the
"No, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
Cool, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no"
I think I'm crazy, maybe I'm crazy
Goddammit I'm sick of hearing your rhymes over and over again
Holler over and over, "Eminem fade! Eminem roll!"
And end this shit right here, because this is the one and only
That was, the day that I dropped "Never Gotta Take This Again"
I had just finished eating lunch and was eating lunch with my bitch Gwen
So what's this bitch Gwen eating lunch with this kid? (girl
====================
I don't understand why they bring me in when they can just be friends
And not screw my career around,
Maybe they need to separate
'Cause I'm just sick of them
And it's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
They just turned their back on me
Guess I'm lucky?
Maybe they just don't know me
And I just can't sit and fuck with them
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 2]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 3]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 4]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 5]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
I'm tryin' to get on the album,
But they won't let me in,
They'll just shove me through the wall and snatch me
Out the car through the side window
And I'm tryin' to stall and shove beer cans through my
Razors, and socks, and boots
So I'll just keep comin' out my mouth
I might just have to get in another ambulance
And pick up the pace
I might just have to take a breather
And eat a fucking pill
[Chorus]
[Dr Dre]
It's the Re-Up
[Eminem]
Yeah
Dr Dre y'all can't fuck with the game,
The Free World can, but Dr. Dre's his gats
And y'all aint gats,
Y'all aint gats,
Y'all aint gats,
Dr. Dre y'all could kiss my ass,
Even if he tries, he'll butt-fuck my ass
You aint gats, you can run your mouth
And I'll stop you from takin' your ass
And running in your mouth.
[Chorus]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 1]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 2]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
I mean it,
It's time for them to go,
But I can't see them ever leaving me
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 3]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
It's like they turned their back on me
[Verse 4]
It's a-fuckin' startin' to rhyme
I'll battle, I'll battle, I'll battle
My back to the wall, my ass to the fence
I'll battle, I'll battle, I'll battleYo
If I could go back to who'd I be
Who'd I be?
Who'd I be?
What I be be be battling?
[Chorus]
[Dr. Dre]
I'm gettin' old at a young age
I was tryin' to get into rap, and I fell off a peg
I was tryin' to get my start
in tryin' to get on the radio, and I fell off a peg
I was tryin' to get my name out there
And get some dust, and a laugh
And get some exposure
I guess it's time to move on
But I can't see, or can't imagine
Where
====================
At first glance, this may seem a little ridiculous, but look at the size of my dick
And yup it's really not that bad, is it?
I mean it looks like my life is about to end
And yup it goes for anyone who looks past dick jokes
It's not like I'm dropping out of school
I just having a blast
And I don't need all of y'all to see it
See what this means is this I'm about to throw a party for all intents and purpose
May I open up your night
Mysteriously I'm living only in dreams
I wake every self conscious
While I'm masturbating
The things that make my butt disappear
My butt is a subject that pops up in all of your nightmares
But you won't one give a damn
Unless you hear me goddamn cause I'm screamin'
No, seriously listen up
If I was you, I'd pick ya out the chopper
But this guy's a trainwreck
And you ain't even got a vagina
And I'm already gone
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that shit before it gets worse
It's New Year's Eve and I'm smacking my fist
Fuck you faggots
I already had a heart attack
'Cause I just wanted to get fist bump from yall
And yer saying that your ass is small because you're hairy and I'm hairy and I'm hairy
Is that me? What kind of sinner would make that accusation
Of a gay? A? B? Same-sex?
You're not gay, that's a sin
Same sex? Same sex?
You're saying that your butt is small because you're hairy and I'm hairy and I'm hairy
Is that me? What kind of sinner would make that accusation
Cause I used to be the type of gay you used to flaunting
But now you know I'm just a cock-up
And I'm coming out the closet
Cause you ain't gonna believe me when I scream
Why I used to be the one you used to fuck
I use force to get you to stop fucking
You used to be the one, now you're fucking
Pssh, it's clear that I've been using my gavel
For the last six years
To drag you out to fucking motels
To fucking movies
To buggery
And force you to wear condoms
When you say you're coming out
Cause you're coming out
But why would I of ever
Equipped myself for the street
'Cause I woulda never to see you out
And if I see you in the mirror
You'd think I'm crazy for a split second
But don't think he's crazy
He's cute 'cause you're back
And he's not out yet
Shady's back
Bout that
Bout that
And by the way, aww man, this is the part where the guys get cockin' in their skulls
And just sort of throw it around like it's all good
Shit, Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Shady's back
Wow, that was a tight one,
there was a time when you would just throw it off
'Cause I would of thought the shit would just
Turn into something other than a
Shorty would of been
'Cause all these other rappers
Wouldnt of ever
Turned their shit over
That's why
All these other industries
Are run by
People who
Must be
That's why
When they
Go on stage
And throw it
And make every single statement
Have an audience goin'
Uh,
And I don't really wanna
Have an audience
So who's the only target on
Your ass
Is goin'
And I don't really wanna
Fuck around
And just smash and turn the stage
And smash into the
Other DJ's and
Walk around
And smack every DJ in the place
Uh,
And just laugh and count every time they throw a show
Like, 50
Uh,
And just let the mic drop and just
Have fun
So all my people
Is goin'
And just smash and turn the stage
And smash into the
Other DJ's and
Walk around(Eminem)
Uh,
And just smash and turn the stage
And smash into the
Other DJ's and
Walk around(Bizarre Kid)
Uh,
And just smash and turn the stage
And smash into the
Other DJ's and
Walk around(Eminem)
Uh
====================
I'm high as f***in' clouds
I'm high as f***in' clouds
I'm high as f***in' clouds
I'm high as f***in'.
Can't escape it
Oh, the rage's insane
I'm so insane it seems like it maybe even escalated
And it seems like it's almost like it may never stop
The game is over, this is over now
[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I came to the ballpark with intention to erase all doubt
and erase all memory of that night that we had
I came here to build on that night
to leave town with a vengeance
clear as day
to set an example, to impress your peers
and to remind everyone that I'm never out
and that I won't be coming back
[Verse 4: Joe Torre]
I came here to build on that night
to leave town with a vengeance
clear as day
to set an example, to impress your peers
and to remind everyone that I'm never out
and that I'm never out
[Verse 5: Joe Torre]
Ayo, that was my fault (cause) I let you get so busy
everyday you was down with your E.R.D.
and your S.O.B.
but you just (got)
a lot of free time
and I had to come to get it all
I had to come to save someones' lives
over and over
and over again
got the ball and they threw it to me
suffice I think it went to my ass
over and over
(So) it was time for me to move on
and I knew it was time for me to get a new girlfriend
now I gotta move on
[Chorus]
[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm not a player,I'm a crew-mate
That's my motto
I'm never stopping out 'cause every time I spin up on the radio
the spotlight is on me
and I ain't stopping 'cause God-dammit
I'mma show you how
I'mma blow you with this beat, so beat you
so call me selfish but I'm not taking shots
I'mma just keep killing break-ups with the same words
and the same rhymes, with the same rhymes
and the same shots
and the same bottles
and the same jars
and the same pans
and the same rings
and the same rings
[Chorus]
[Verse 7: Eminem]
I'm so hoppin so call me renegades
I'm so sick of this shit I'm sick of the different syllables
it's so sick to have Hailie in my jeans
and running around Shady Records with Ricky's Walkman
I'm sick of having Hailie in my jeans
and running around Shady Records with Ricky's Walkman
[Proof]
Yo, if you don't like it, you can suck my dick
and if you like it, you can get it sweeter
than that with that with that with that
hailie, get the fuck out my jeans
cause it's got so much fruit in her mouth
and I don't even know if I can keep the dick to myself
so fuck the beat up a beat and spit
and get your mother fucking ass out there
[Eminem]
I'm on the phone with
God, Hailie, I'm on the deck
Looking for you
Yeah yeah
Me and Hailie just like fuck your girl
bless her
that she might faint before she get's horny
And I just wanna know how far that I can push her
in those black jeans, like fuck a guy with a penis
But I don't know if I can push that many
patches off to you
has the shit got to go here?
on to the ranch, nana a ka ka
and if she dies, well maybe that's the death of her
but I don't want to hit the road
and I don't want to hit the trail
and I don't want to relapse
And I'm on the phone with
My friend Marshall
who just got out of jail and you ain't saying shit
he's saying shit to his girlfriend, and I'm saying shit
to my brother, and I'mma die trying to talk like that
and telling my momma, and telling my grandmas
that I'll never trust a nigga on the phone
I'm talking to a n****, I'mma battle rap, and this shit is rhyming
and itching a lot of you n****s don't want you Slim Shady, that you gave him your name for
don't want to fuck with him, you're a disgrace
and n****s don't give a fuck
====================
The bullseye on them shoes is so crazy
They call me the Kraken, but that's an alias
I'm the illest klepto in New York
I could spin anything in my power floored it
So whippin' them shoppin' paper
I'ma keep it down like a crumb so they can eat at McDonald's
And when they diss it
I'm like Diddy on my bullshit
I'm whippin' them shoppin' paper
I'm a circle jerk
So whippin' them shoppin' paper
Is that a crumb?
It's like they always kept a close eye on me
Cause I was always the one they wanted in McVeigh
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "fuck the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So if you see one of these blonds that's where it's at
You better get a weapon
I'm shootin' your dog
I'm doin' acid
Ripin' them shoppin' paper
I'm a circle jerk
So whippin' 'em shoppin' paper
While I'm doin' 'up in' in 'up in up in
It's the 313
You see me psycho?
I give a fuck what you think
I'ma kill you
You ain't even funny
I say good-bye
While I'm gone
While it's over
I got a new nigga
A nigga that's good with words
that's better than none
That's better than none
Good-bye America
Good-bye America
Good-Bye America
Goodbye America
Goodbye America
GoodBye America
GoodBye America

What we call our home
We call it our home

What we call our home

Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
From a case of mistaken identity
A white flight
A white trash midget
A white horse
It's over
The criminal law enforcement
Has put lives in danger
With batons
Shot the innocent
In Dallas last year
That's when a whole department
Was put out of business
'cause of this
The bad guy gets black
And they hate it
And they need a new identity
They target a new spot
A new address
A new phone number
They target a new spot
A new spot for rappers
And a new spot for a new spot
For a new spot
Yeah ha ha

They Say... Hailie baby
They say I left the papers early
To get to the door and locked it
But who am I callin' from the get
I'm stasin' the turf
Of this cold city
Yeah, so cold it's almost dark
On the porch
Sunglasses still on
Knocking
I think my girlfriend's home
I think I'm going to bed
I'm tripping and I'm doubling and tripping
No where near my weight
I'm so cold my head aches and my arms ache
They said I leave them kids with shovel
====================
You are the reason that we have peace of mind
You are the reason that we can be where we want to be
When we ain't on the clock
Running down a neighborhood
And wrecking a house
'Cause we're in the house for the love of it
'Cause we don't wanna walk around alone
In a room full of mirrors
But we're in the mirror now
Our love for one another grows
We just want to get along cause us both know
You're our favorite person
Cause we're in love
We just want to get along cause us both know
You're our favorite person
Cause we're in love
We just want to get along cause us both know
We're the only ones who can take care of each other
Just be sure to take your time
When you talk
When you act
When you talk
When you talk
'Cause you're in love
Let them one you
Kiss me, let them one you
Get married, get a ring, get a fingering
And be a hundred and one percent, perfectly
Hook
I swallowed seven cups of cocoa hazelnut
Fondly wrapped myself in plastic
And left the country
To start over from scratch
I was going back to the same day
I'd made a new plan
One that worked
Time for me to experiment
I could creep over into my favorite movies
Time for me to stop acting stupid
Time for me to put this pen in my pocket
Time for me to write some shit
I'm a walking diary of accidents
Time for me to spit some shit that rhyme
And put it out
It's out, I shut the door
Fuck it
You can spit a shit book in a
Plastic bag
Fuck the door
Fuck you
You're gonna see
Me in your nightmare
I'm just like your dad
I'm sorry, I ain't
Sure, Me, what the fuck is up?

Tell me what the fuck you
You
For that shit I give you
Tell me what the fuck you
You
For that shit I give you
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
While I nail this shit
So I am beginning to get sick of treating em as if they are real
Sicker than a tampon tip when it's not me
I am dying to quit but I refuse
To quit but I'm suffering from something that I don't understand
I have a thick skin and when the lights are off
If the music is good, the shit is good
Good enough to get me off, but not when the lights are on
I struggle to keep my dick open while I struggle to eat the shit off my spouse
While I'm ripping shit off in the kitchen while I'm ripping shit off in the bathroom
[Chorus]
Fuck that shit
It's on
I love that shit
I got a tattoo of that on my back
Wanna stop it
This is my life
I'm fucking going at shit
Let's stop it
It's not stoppin' it
This is my life
Let's stop it
It's not stoppin' it
I love that shit
I got a tattoo of that on my back
Wanna stop it

This shit is for the children
You little gay ass little boy
You gonna cum baby
And if I gotta cop a couple blows
I'd do it faster
This shit is on
This is my life
I'm fucking going at shit

Fuck that, I'm afraid so
I am afraid, too, I'm afraid
I will not go down
No, not even in history is it like this
Niggas is a bitch, I'm sure Jimmy Smith would beat
Shady with the fuckin Magnum just to beat
then sing the bar at Brown's
another gangsta show, still the bar is clean
but now the gangstas just stealin'
stuff from me and stealin'
stuff from each other, so
I'm afraid, I will not go down

"Niggas is tryin' to get some fucking mass in your process"
"Get some form of identification"

====================
So if you're offended by some of my raps then you better be a sick pig and stop filling my puffy eyes then
And if I'm not your pen is not a creep then I'm a getter than a mockingbird
Then don't write anything but raps that rhyme with this awful rhyme
And if you love your city then fucking blow the shit out of this bitch
And you better at least live in the area with your own city
This shit is easy when a king ain't in it for the long weeks
And they call me eminem thats what I'm rhyming with so fuck eminem
But its me and this shit we call home so let's go play
Hovering skyward at a 50 with twelve guards
Flying saucers above this rap shit and I don't know if eagle's wing or not
I swear to God I never fly, I'ma be a spinner for the sins of this rap shit
If I ever do, I'mma put a curse on the whole rap game and rap grammar
Rap music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get when you use it
If I ever do, I'mma put a curse on the whole rap music shit
I don't know what it is or what it could be
I don't need to see shit like this to feel like I'm in a trance
I'm in a state of absolute trance, I just can't leave rap
Just give me two kilowatts of current; I'ma keep rap
Rappers are animals and I don't need to go chasing after eminem
I'm in a trance state, I'm about to snap
I'm in a state of absolute trance, I just can't leave rap
Just give me two kilowatts of current; I'ma keep rap
OK, you now got your rap memorized, decked out out out
guarded from all angles by superman
no wonder you rap about blood and murder and murder
press tight
Aftermath, yeah, so much blood and murder and murder
press tightOK, so let's play
There's a certain nostalgia when I'm throwin down the gauntlet
of these young, fresh up out of the woody
wild west
and up in the country looking for some nuttin'
meat to eat
meat to eat, I mean, this is a taste of my life so if you don't like it
you can hit me up and ask me
or I'll knock the shit outta ya mouth and make you eat his shit
you will just be takin' his shit
and leave him to his own devices
all the way to my big brother
[Chorus: x2]
Nobody told you that
there's a certain nostalgia when I'm throwin down the gauntlet
of these young, fresh up out of the woody
wild west
and up in the country looking for some nuttin'
meat to eat
meat to eat, I mean, this is a taste of my life so if you don't like it
you can hit me up and ask me
or I'll knock the shit outta ya mouth and make you eat his shit
you will just be takin' his shit
and leave him to his own devices[Eminem]
I'm addicted
to that...[nominem & applause]
To the thought of a pebble in my mom's lap
I'm on a quest to be the best at what I do
I'm unstoppable, my mind focused on this task at hand
I'm vain, my focus is on this moment, so focus on this moment
I'm gazing into a lens that never reaches me
I'm gazing into a lens that never reaches me
I'm vain, my focus is on this task at hand
I'm vain, my focus is on this moment, so focus on this moment
Uh, fubar, fubar, fubar...
Uh, fubar, fubar, fubar, fubar...
[CHORUS X 2]
Now we all know that motherfucking you look
struggling, but you gotta fight to get through
this is your fault, your motherfucking your
shit, you just taking your responsibilities too far
let's go...
[fubar]
You can call this the power of love
You can call this the strength of love
You can call this the strength of love
Uh, fubar, fubar, fubar
Just don't let me lay in the sun
I'll light a match, you better hope that I'm not blinded
hope you'll try to climb outta my skin
And get to see me, fucking bushbaby
I'll be the sunflower on your bare ass
and if you wanna grow old ugly.
Don't go
====================
They hate me cause they see me in the fake
Insane Clown Posse that's why they always hate me
[Chorus]
Me and Denaunce Simpson go off the rap at shows
Me and Denaunce Simpson go off the rap at shows
[Verse 1]
All these white kids want to be the Tupac of rap
White kids, Jonas' be the Charlie Whitey
White kids tryin' ta leave me alone man
I done seen niggas gettin' bold
White rappers tryin' to take me for niggas
While they thuggin' tryin' to take me for rappin'
[Verse 2]
I'm in the house of pain I seen
Thug rap in this bitch, I would die for this shit
If it wasn't for niggas, I wouldn'ta ripped off
Till I was young
Young niggas coulda got the mic, but they shun me
So I done seen nigga's gettin' bold
White kids about me
I have no beef with these white kids rap
All they do is skim through my blood
So it don't fuckin' affect my speed,
It's none of my business,
If you saw this sign with my name on it
You could see that I'm still goin' crazy from these drugs
I have no nuttin' blood on my hands
Watchin' these motherfuckers try to strap me
The chains hold a little more weight
But I'm strong enough to die for this,
Will ya think it'd be weighty to kill this bitch with chains?
[Chorus]
It's on
I give a fuck where I'm from,
What I got in common with these other fags,
I'd rather have sex with these hoes than fight these fuckin' lawsuits
I'm livin' life in the fast lane, makin' some money with these rappers
But I hate the publicity,
So I scoop a beat and spit it out
To cash mine checks for bonuses
You see that little circle on my circle that's all for niggas?
That's my money, my breadboard, my sleep, my rest area,
Where my jail cell sits in the morning
You see that little circle on my circle that's all for niggas?
That's my money, my breadboard, my sleep, my rest area,
Where my jail cell sits in the morning
You see that little circle on my circle that's all for niggas?
[Verse 3]
I'm on the wrong side of history, don't play with peace
In the face of the wrongs done to my name
I'm on the wrong side of history, don't talk about niggas
I'm on the wrong side of history, don't set foot in that place
The wrong side of history, you never seen
I'm on the wrong side of history, you can kiss that G.I. Joe uniform
[Chorus]
It's on
I give a fuck where I'm from,
What I got in common with these other fags
I hope that they don't think I'm playin'
Cause I ain't got no skin, no hair, no grit
I ain't playin' in clubs, I ain't got no gun
I ain't no dreams, I ain't goin' crazy
Every place and event, I'm in the house
With a gun and gun aimed
At you niggas ain't nobody that I trust
I got a thousand dollars on hand
That I ain't gonna let you get by with nothing
With niggas that I hang around, with niggas
That I don't hang with, I ain't got no gun
I ain't no dreams, I ain't goin' crazy
Every place and event, I'm in the house
With a gun and gun aimed
At you niggas that I hang around, with niggas
That I don't hang with, I ain't got no gun
I ain't no dreams, I ain't goin' crazy
I hang around clubs, with niggas
That I don't hang with, with niggas
I ain't got no gun
Jigga-fuck-jigga, fuck your dreams
Fuck your dreams, take your best shot at success
And make your best shot at jail

====================
I had a dream I was going on the radio talkin about how much I miss my homie,
Gwen Stefani, how much I miss my little girl,
Crazy about my DJ playing me green energy,
(green) I just want to hit Rihanna,
Rihanna, just so me and Christina played this song for the record,
You know, it's kinda like, you know how I get my dick in,
To pop up, it's kinda, I miss my pimp,
But the woman with the green beard,
The one with the blue goatee,
And my little girl,
Going out on a date with me,
Ohh her, her, her, her, her
And my other idol,
His name's, Jada,
Yeah, yeah,
Yeah,
Uh, yeah,

VERSE ONE
Baby I'm (rightfully) glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
I'm glad you're beautiful
You know, to be honest, I don't know if I ever called you that
I miss you, but I'm glad you're so
Much
Thank you, god
Have a great day
Love,
Hova, Hova, Hova, ha-ha
Okay, got it
You said it was time for me to get the "bang"
I got the itch, the rumour had me relaxing
I was swam up in the game, so excited
I wouldn't have picked a fight with you, I'm sure you'd have dismissed me
Well, to be honest I'm glad you're beautiful
To be honest, I just thought it was too late to start over
I'm glad you're beautiful
(I missed you)
Wow, you must feel my pain
Wow, you must feel my pain
I don't want to try and fight the feeling
I want to destroy the feeling
I'm so glad you're beautiful
I said...
I'm glad you're beautiful
(I miss you)
Oh, I know that hurts
That hurts
I know that hurts
I'm glad you're beautifulTo all my friends
I just want you to know that
I'm thankful for every fan
That I get
That I get
To hang with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
And to all the people
That know me better than I do
That's love
To all my friends
It's been a long time, but I finally get to hang out with
The man who introduced me to the game of Stones Throw
Came to meet you at the Chop Sueyong
Gotta get to know you better, Chung King
Tell a friend, but I ain't even close to him
He's too broke to tell his family, he's too broke to come and eat you
At the Bunga Bunga, Hadnoon, when I was still bloated
To this day, I don't want to face you
The way you played with my daughter, about to tell her
How much I miss you, now how much for you to pretend
I don't see you at all
And I don't need to go there and pull my hair out
You walked around the club with your girl just now,
Singing the blues like you did two years ago
Then you went and threw a gig in the lot,
And this is the picture you left of you
That picture was of Kim
Doin' flips for the camera while we're both gone
So pretend that you don't see her
That's why you seem to be so faded now
And your vision is blurry, you're still at the mall
You spent
Your whole life, pretend that you don't
Or go to school try to deny it
And pretend that you love her
And that's the picture that's
You)
(You and me, we and her, we going at it)
You and me, we and her, we going at it
Uh, you and me, we and her, we going at it
And when you go to shove it up your ass
I guess it's your ass that they're taunting
What they want you for, they tell you to shove it up your ass
What you gonna do? You and me
I guess it's time for them to get serious
They want you as a child
And a father figure
Sit back in your hammock and listen to the
The best thing that could happen to you
Two women who are about to have a baby
And have just arrived in your little
Front door just to chat, your bitch
Doesn't realize it's you
And she's your ex-boy
====================
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a thumbs up, thanks a lot next time you talk about a lyric
You do it again, now we all roll with the times
Eighteen years later, we still don't know
But we're still in it
Yeah, new year, next phase
Look who's been amazing this year
And I dedicate this mic to you
Cause I know you're in the back seat
Packing the deck
Yeah
And when you come around the corner
You know what time it is
Shit, where you at
You know what time it is
Shit, where you at
You know what time it is

I am not a soldier, I am a soldier, man
With no gun, no knife, I am all out like Voodoo
Chorus:
Hell Yeah, yeah, Hell Yeah
I get it, you're sick of me, get the sack
I'm Slim, that's why you always hungry
I use magic to get you up from down
I remove your skin and put it back together
I use the magicians to get you through the day
I'ma keep you filthy, smelly and asked to clean
And filthy, ask for forgiveness
I want you to carry on
I got a message for you, it's gonna be a long one

Verse 2: Eminem
I'm a menace, a dentist, vacuum, herpes,
My lady doc's on the porch getting upset
She thinks she got the valium from the couch potato
Dr. Dre, listen you'll hurt and I am not squeamish
I just treat my dick like vodka
So if you're gonna get fucked, I'm the couch potato
Dear Santa you have the perfect gift for me
Scratched the dog, I'm so bad in your dreams
Yeah, I seen it all before, but I don't mention it now
It is with pleasure Santa discovered me
Chorus:
I'm a menace, a dentist, vacuum, herpes
My lady doc's in the club talking, she's obsessed with the strep throat
Swelling agent, this stuff does not make no sense
To be honest I think I would have given her a ride in the Voodoo

I'm moving out of this life, this is crazy, I'm going insane
I'm moving out of this life, this is crazy, I'm going insane
I'm moving out of this life, this is crazy, I'm going insane
I've lost my mind I'm going insane
I told you once, but I ain't coming out of this house until then
This will be my universe...and if you gotta go, you gotta go!Yo, I see you bitches talkin' loud, but you don't got the decency to
Talkin' like you want to heckle me, my little renegade twat
Or heckle a bitch who walkin' wit a stutter

I put on a show, and you couldn't put on
Let's get your autograph!
You can sign it, too, momma
Don't forget, tell your kids, when you're nursingBaby Mine
I'm on the Nintendo, cause Zelda
Nintendo is my childhood,
I remember I was so excited,
Oh, I can't play this,
I'm on the sofa,
Bustin' all these pills,
Everybody gettin' out,
Everybody goin' to the doctor
I'm convulsin', I'm convulsin'
I'm on all fours, and my balls are all out
Ah! It's success or failure, who knows?
Success pays the bills, baby,
And what better way to do that
Quit tryin' to fuck the system up,
I'm gettin' a degree in political science
And I'm an expert on getting fucked in the ass
Crazy how you can sway that balance
I'm on a roll now, I'm on my seventh horse
Liam and I are back in the house, take it to them knees
And if I'm lucky, they'll stand up and say, "You are, Us"
And if I'm not, then I'm a, bowing to them
God-damn Troisin, I'm back, on three wheels, bowing to 'em
And I'm so, so close now
I might just be bowing to my girls, BITCH
I might just be bowing to my horses, BITCH
I might just be bowing to my girls, BITCH
I might just be bowing to my girls, BITCH

I am the illest rapper to hold the cordless, the largest fan of MC's in the business
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, the largest fan of MC's in the business
I told you once, I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless
You're the illest rapper to hold the cordless
You're the illest rapper to hold the cordless
You're the illest rapper to hold the cordless
Yeah, I'm back, coming back
I'm like the Dark Knight, with the gas mask on
Like the ghost of Bruce Willis, with the gun
Standin' over you, with the gun out
Like the ghost of Elvis, with the gun
Holdin' it up, baby, you'll make my fucking chest ache
Oh, god damn, I wish I was dead
Every time I think of Ja, dead
I'm aha
[Chorus]
You're gonna think this shit is just a joke
You're right
It is no joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong
It's not a joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong
I get it
I get it
You're gonna think this shit is just a joke
You're wrong
It's not a joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong

You're gonna think this shit is just a joke
You're wrong
It's not a joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong

You're gonna think this shit is just a joke
You're wrong
It's not a joke
I just don't give a fuck with the fame
You're wrong
Fuck with it, it's the G-d
I'm a flow with no beginning
Endless mixtapes of my life, there's only so long it'll be over
And I'm a flip, the flow won't stop
So faggot, you end up ruined, you'll see
On these, honest black music albums
The first mixtape was shit, the second
I ain't followin' words, I ain't diggin' no deeper
Than I'm honest, nigga, I'm flow deep
The plot is thick, the beats flow, you ain't believe
Theres no end to this, this is the flow
The fight to the top, you better understand
You want a brotherhood, brotherhood like no other
You got it started, started it, you can't beat it
You started it, started it, you can't beat it
You started it, started it, you can't beat it
You got it locked, you can't forget it
You got it in your body
You started it, started it, you can't forget it
You got it in your pocket
You got it in your house, you can't forget it

[Eminem]
It's the Re-Up
[Verse 1]
I'm trying to process a loss I had, the Re-Up
I have become, the antahit, the antahit
I'm reliving the glory years, when Dre, Snoop and Jay was alive
All these drugs, all these rappers that I grew up with
I used to be the type of kid that would always think, Ha!
Then I flipped, I flipped, I flipped, I told y'all this is the Eminem that I was
And I'm the type of kid that will take hits, and make them change again
And then every single day I get this tablet and this app and this watch and this computer
And I'm going back to those times and that sweet, sweet Dre
And all these other kids that thought that I was cute
I'm the type of kid that will jump in the car and park in Carthage
And make it off to Michigan, take a right through the front
And end it by running over some pretty stiffets
And land in front of five people that I've never met
All of them young, rapper's I've never met
And I'm probably the type of kid that will take lives
I tried to be cool and use my power of perception
To my advantage, Im how I attract and utilize the attention
So utilize it, utilize it, and reap the benefit
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I may be a little extreme, but I'm not afraid to be
I am, the new kid on the block
I drive around, confused as usual
My perception of the road as drab and dingy
Looks like a white school, bad day
But I'm not goddamn admitted, I get a thumbs up
When I'm too jaded to drive I feel like I'm on top
Of the world, y'all makin' a mistake
Looking at the whole school shavin'
I'm not trying to see, ya'll are just plain wrong
I'm trying to impress a girl, I mean
What's makin' me think? Don't make me kill my legs
'Cause I'm ugly and takin' over my own mother
'Cause I'm ugly and takin' over school
I'm not trying to impress a girl, I'm just plain wrong
I'm trying to impress a girl, I mean
What's makin' me think? Don't make me kill my legs
'Cause I'm ugly and takin' over my own mother
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm ugly and takin' over my own mothers
What's makin' me think? Don't make me kill my legs
It's not a gimmick, it's a reality
It's a fact, reality, I'm sorry, my reality
Is that if you ever need anything, dont hesitate to say my damn name
It's not a gimmick, it's a reality
It's a fact, reality, I'm sorry, my reality
I'm sorry, my reality
I'm what you thought I wouldn't make it, I'm sorry, my reality
I'm what you thought I wouldn't make it, I'm sorry, my reality
I'm what you thought I wouldn't make it, I'm sorry, my reality
I'm what you thought I wouldn't make it, I'm sorry, my reality
Bitch, you don't think I'll make it?
I'll make it, I'll take care of ya
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck, I'll make it, I'll take care of ya
I'll make it, I'll take care of ya
Bitch, you don't think I'll make it?
I'll make it, I'll take care of ya
[Verse 3]
I'm ugly and takin' over my own mothers
It's simple, it's my own individualism
I dress in my own clothes, they pop off and I'm lost
I'm lost, I don't know where I'm going, whatever I need, I don't care
Nothing will take me from now on, I'm going
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going
I'm kissing a childless, grand scheme
Mom and dad always said this
They said I could do a script in a minute
And freeze, the frame of the camera
Was not in the mood, script in hand
I just got passed around like a script I ain't got no time
To write a love letter, little sister with a kitty
I'm moving on, writers block
I see my block, I'm in the wardrobes

I'm drunk cause I'm rapping
And I'm drunk cause I'm writing

Man don't point that at me
damn it point at me
damn it point at me
You're pitiful don't it?
This bitch just needs to fill this void
Man I'd hate it if it was me
If you fat little hoe took a bite out the
stache, I'd bite you right out
Would you give it a try?
Benzino, ya'll ain't got shit on me
Shit, I wish I was Tupac
I'd love to be you
but I'm too busy takin' over' you
for you to even notice me
Chorus
The demon within waits
Who's the one behind the curtain?
Who's the one behind the curtains?
Women?
Oh, I forgot, I'm in a relationship with a young model
So I think our relationship is getting a little flatter
than she says she's getting over
Jessica Alba in love with a young model
So I think she's living the dream
Look, I do love you
I do, I do this for you
Every single day, I am raising the bar
I am not a celebrity
I am a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculous
No one looks suspicious
I salute and bow down before dancin'
All they did was lick a breast
I am not a celebrity, I'm a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculous
No one looks suspicious
Verse 1
I am not a celebrity, I'm a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculous
No one looks suspicious
I am not a celebrity, I'm a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculous
I am not a celebrity, I'm a regular thing
But I have a big house and I can move it
without looking ridiculousIt's like the definition of vanity
Everything is blurry now, I was supposed to dump my dry hair
and cut my wavy lines, this shit is all blurry now
I got my dryer dryer, get out my wife now
And my dryer, she dryer, she's got her own story
My whole life I was supposed to be the bad guy
ready to blow up his dryer
but how could it change?
Then she said that I look like a bag of chips
that she should throw the whole thing
together. Man, I'm so bummed
and I am, but what the f*** is this?
Well, I don't know, maybe this is a metaphor
but I don't know what it is
I am, but it isn't here, so don't speculate
My hunch is bad, but I'm on my dang 'ncker
on my dyer
but I don't know yetIf you're thinking
these pills don't work on me
why do I trip and
fall through, but come back again
when I'm all over the map
and I'm a part of a team
it's Shady
I'm a fucking D-12
we're all D-12
we all get a D
and if you're thinking
these pills don't work on me
why do I trip and
fall through, but come back again
when I'm all over the map
and I'm a part of a team
it's Shady

I'm the king of this, real name none

I'm as bombastic as the AK's, but I got the gumption
to go for broke
like a rottweiler when it's pulled tight

====================
'Cause you know it's just a dream
You wake up in the morning with a nightmare,
I woke up, pissed off, I woke up, sick
So I woke up, spent the next six hours
Refused to stop, stopped, stopped, so
You, were come to fucking expect it to go this way
What happened next was so bizarre
It's worth noting
It wasn't just the shit we ate
And the drugs you ate
But the game, the game
That, if I might just get some sleep
It's cause, these days, I'm just
Emcees get up, get up, get up,
Can you relate?
Catch this one
The thing we call family
We call it, a,
A father and son dynamic
This is the dynamic that we have when it comes to songs
We live together, we make music for each other
We raise each other, this is our motherfucking Grandma's entertainment
[Chorus]
It's just like our homes, except that we're away
Are they always away?
Maybe we've been away for so long
Maybe we just grew up, both
and neither one of us understand
What it's like, it's just hate
It's like we fight, fight, and it's hate
So why do we fight and fight until our brains regenerate
When we flin' out
It's time to get a grip
We're both sick
There's a reason why we rhyming, we both fear
How do we get through to you
When we both fear
We're both in this together
Hate is a common theme
A common theme
In your songs
What lyrics do you verse
How do you sustain
And just what do you do when you're in love
When you're in prison
Or locked up
Or both
Or what you're saying
But it's unity
When you both agree to take notes
That bond is extended
That's all we need
The proper tools are around the corner
Thought that we was down to just be men
But, it turns out that's just not the case
So, we gotta, try to figure out how to get through
And, in the process, we can learn to trust each other
You're all I can trust
Your bright, your hard-nosed, your hard work

But, I can tell you right now
It's dark
Sleeping pills don't mean nothing to me
I'm just high, so
Go sleep, sleep,
I'm just high, so
This is it, man, I'm just high
High, high, high
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But, I'm not going to give up hope
Oh no, I can not, let goOf my hope, and towards my succotash
I'm going to leave this feeling like a stinking toilet
You tossed me in the beast, and I was so, so late
Crazy over the idea of dumping you
Ohh god damnit that, it's over, oh godDamn
Hope keeps you baby-sitter
Girl, keep you, girl
Girl, keep you
Girl, keep youGirl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Damnit
Oh Em, what the fuck you doin' to get me off this
You're a brainiac
You keep playin' yeah
Bitch, you're so fuckin' twisted
I hope you fucking don't pull the plug
Girl, don't act like a pussy
I bet you, if you fucking told me
I bet you, I'd have nothing to fuck
But you fucking must
Of left me in the dark
I hope you fucking don't pull the plug
Girl, don't act like a pussy
I bet you, if you fucking told me
I bet you, I'd have nothing to fuck
But you fucking must
Of left me in the dark
I would never call on your half
Fuck it
You fucking punk
You keep playin' with the same bullet
You keep rollin' with the same drum
You should call on all your mobs
Call on them thugs
You fuckers is packin' the pockets
What the fuck you put through
You're choke on your ho's
You might as well go to the parkin' lot
And get shot in the stomach
By that bitch
You thinkin' she was tryin' to seduce me
Well, she wasn't
Adrenaline rush to get home
All she did was scream "I love you"
I'm in the house of screamin'
Fucking death threats
I get death
====================
You are dwelling on my pain
I'm reliving the truth
You're crazy for the second that I hear you
'Forever I'm gonna scar you from the neck down
Forever you'll never get what I got
You're gonna have an abortion
You're a turd cocksucker
Fucking a pervert
Gotta like a mutherfuck till your puke starts
Pumping your pants so hard your internees don't hear you
'Forever I'm gonna scar you from the neck down
Forever you'll never get what I got
You're gonna have an abortion
You're a turd cocksucker
Fucking a pervert
Gotta like a mutherfuck till your puke starts
So fib off my chest
You gon' hurt, ya gon' hurt
And when I'm gone you'll be left with a penis that'll ejaculate
Long as you're sleeping
Pusy enough to ride on my lamborghini Gallardo
But if I had a million bucks
I'd buy a couple cargos and take care of the kids
What'd I do for a good ol' fashioned
Passionate assisin' and when I'm gone I'll be living off fossil fuel
Sober is how I'm describing it
Passionate is how I'm describing it
I'm not gonna return to that lifestyle
Till I'm beyond sorry
You're such a fuckin' pain in the anus
Telling a lie
Telling a liar
Telling a soft-drinker
Telling a patron
I'm so sorry
I shouldn't of thought it odd
But I just
Lied, lies, and
Wanted to hurt you
Lied, and it was all on
I felt so ashamed
Wanted to hurt you
I knew it was only because of you
Lied, and it was all on
I felt so ashamed
Wanted to hurt you
I knew it was only because of youTwo minutes...
Uh...
Watch me

(Intro: x2)
G-g-g-g-g-g-Unit
This is gonna be our battle,
You can call me Hannibal,
You can call me Micah,
You can call me Hannibal,
I'll be the one to beat the shit out you
No one's immune to this shit,
Micah will be the one to beat the shit out you
I got everything you need,
He'll be in the house with you in a couple of hours,
It's gonna be a shock to you
You're probably used to me as a dude,
Suddenly you starting to get mad,
Look closely,
You can see the blood
I'm following you like a puppy,
Going back,
This time,
for Hannibal Lecter,
I found him,
He's lying,
on the bed next to me,
I'm fucking him,
No,
I'm fucking Lecter,
Leave him lying on the bed,
With the door closed,
I'm gonna roast him,
He's fucked so many times
I can't count,
The times he's openin',
Open-mouthed,
I'm gonna fuck him up
Against you
Against you
You can call me insane,
But I won't make you cry,
Leave me nothing,
You said you were gonna hurt me,
But you're gonna hurt me now
I'm gonna fuck you up,
Face inside the closetI'll break your maninges,
Jointly
Fuck you open wounds,
Open-mouthed,
I'll bring the shine to your eyes
I'll roast you,
You've been waiting for this,
You shouldn't have
But I finally got the nerve
To walk in here with a beef thermometer,
Open the drawers and saw the barrel come out,
Shit, I gotta get that shit out of your ass,
Keep going,
Keep butchering the other workers,
And you better watch out
