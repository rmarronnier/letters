...
Dear Santa, I'm on time (I'm on time)
I got a letter from your momma
I'm sorry Santa, I just found your body
I'll call you back, you know I got a new song to sing
Uh, what song is that?
Hello? My name is Mrs. Butterworth
My name is Mrs. Butterworth
I'm a lame little wee, I need a ride
I'm so old I thought I
Went to work at Neverland, but I'm hard to swing
I need a new outlet, I canopic, I can't swallow ice
I can't spell it, but I understand it
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would probably find out which one I slept in
Under my bed and up under my faucet
"Slim, Mr. and Mrs. Pender
Have you ever been hated for being different"
That's right, Shirley Chisholm
Jealous, jealous, me neither!
Just call me Chico, change your tune
I'm making a Frankenstein, I'm following a similar path
To kidnap kids, take their fathers names
Doctor sit down, what are you doing out loud?
I'm getting so damn sick, I'm admitting I fell off the teeth
Started gagging my mouth, went to sip my sip
Kicked the back of my neck off and started shaking my neck
I figured I'd give her my well, I'm a spoiled little baby
But you're just a little pig, fuck baby and I'm not going to hurt you
I won't beg, please, escape, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I Won't Come Back To Scrutin' Baby's Ass Please
And this is just the first verse of "I Won't Come Back To Scrutin' Baby's Ass"
I'll be back baby, I Won't Come Back To Scrutin' Baby's Ass Please
Fuckin' Ew I won't come back, sweeter 2pac, peanut butter, jelly,
Fuck you think you Wonder Boys gonna come out like this and still be boys?
I won't come back to Scrutin' Baby's Ass Please, will you please accept my love?
I won't come back to Scrutin' Baby's Ass Please, will you please accept my love?
yea, I don't give a fuck, all I ever do is watch me spit it
[Chorus:]
And you won't see me like you see me in a white T-Shirt
White Pony, pedal steel bitch
Stuck at home, root beer
Making quick work of the dumbest kids in the house
And all the other dumb girls
Taking him to the ground and hermetically sealed off
He screamed "bloody mary", because he didn't mean to sound so dumb
And if you still don't get it, I'ma tell you in a minute
'Cause after all the years we've been this way
I'm a combination of Mark Wahlberg and Linwood
Me, Wahlman, and Nicole Kidman, we're a cross between Jason Mraz and
Chris Rock, y'all are gonna get decapitated too
And Richard Pryor, and Houdini, and Ricky Martin
Y'all are gonna get rapped too, bitch
And raped too, and end up with sticks, hoes, and eggs
I'm totin' the North Pole, and all they do is rape
And keep shootin' up, and pourin' out blood
While I'm sittin' at the gashes, relaying to my girls
What the fuck's goin' on? Man, I'm gettin' busy, I'ma punch ya stomach like a banana
When will the dumbest boy admit it
Will sound familiar, how'd it sound when you were a prude
Appeared on the show to be sat, traumatized
Had your picture taken, my identification
Was the rapper on your cover, your address posted
Please admit it, did you take my picture?
It was a rhetorical question, how do you address people when you don't know them?
My answer: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
Instagram, yea, Chrome, Internet, dick naked.
How do you describe an asshole?
I'm known as a asshole
But I can't explain everything, so I'm backtossin'
And this is takin' my anus, and tearing it to shreds
Oh my God, I can't believe this is happening
Can't explain it, can't nobody do it better
I mean, I can't be proud of every single person I fuck
But I try, I take a pen and I'll hit you bastards
====================
You don't wanna rap like this
Got your heart disease
[Heart disease]
[Obie Trice]
Shit if I could break out my vocal cords before the music stopped
I'd wreck this place (take a hike)
[Eminem]
This place is my ghetto ghetto
This is your urban oasis
This is your transvestite and your transvestite life
This is your thing
This is your life
I'm trying to figure out how to be
My destiny will always call me
I'm always destined to be the next Kanye
I can never repay these god damn dollars
for speaking my mind conscience
I'm trying to be the shit
(What? Ha ha ha)
[Obie Trice]
Shit I Had a Daddy Tumble meet up with Benzino
And asked him if he had a car
We hit slump, he said he was doing great
And that he wants a new one
Shit, you don't wanna own a Bentley, either
Shit that won't fix the fact
That you don't wanna own a Bentley, either
Shit that won't fix the fact
That you don't wanna own a Bentley, either
Shit that won't fix the fact
That you don't wanna own a Bentley, either
Shit that won't fix the fact
A Bentley's all you need it, a Bentley is all you need
Yeah, I'll admit, I was brought up on a false childhood
Where my mom always used to remind me, "You don't want a Bentley, either"
You need a trunk, you got one now, do you have one?
[Obie Trice]
Yeah, I've gone through my share of bulls***,
But never has there been such a phenomenal childhood
And it was a lifelong grind, and I'm constantly
Referent myself in life, but I'm always kept inside it
But what's even D-12 from their infancy, trying to figure out
What it is, a thing, a label, a part of my being
Fed up with everything, that I been through, that's bullshit
And constantly kept going through underground, like I'm a super-star
Like I got a limited pool of talent, like I can't always find the right
People around me, all of them different races, all of my colors
Just feel me out cause I tell it, represent my beliefs
Against everything that they may hold, for whatever reason
I fought and I'll battle and I'll never succumb
But I also know that it can take a while to get over,
See just the fact that you love me and appreciate what I stand for,
That I'm a man, I can be the President of the world,
But I will not succumb to pressure, I'm not afraid
I've had people ask me why I choose to be me
They seem to think I'm crazy for trying to pull strings?
Well I'm a known quantity, I came to be a known quantity
And I don't know if I've ever met a man like you who isn't determined
To fight for what you want, no matter how hard you push
You're a name you won't forget, I'm waiting for you
For the cause to say that, you're my chosen name
So I'm a man, I can be the chosen name
Cause a name you don't know about, and a name you want, but you want
You name's never K-Mart, I'm out in the country man
And I'm running from there
I'm ready for the fans, I'm ready for the fame to save me
I'm ready for the fans, I'm ready for the fame to save me
I'm ready for the fans, I'm ready for the fame to save me
[Eminem]
Yeah, it's the soul of rap, is can you even say goodnight)
Cause at the end of the day we're just like you and I and you fool
Can you put a dollar figure on the relationship between us?
Clear picture, I'm not trying to argue, it's just this fuckin' holiday
And I'm free to go about my day, just like I don't have to spend a dollar
Somewhere in between these homes, someplace, somewhere, it's not like I'm alone
It's a fact, there's people all over the place who just know what it's like to be together
People who know what it's like to be with their dogs, man I'm so tickled by it
I love it when I tell 'em, they know that I ain't scared, I'm so glad that I came along
It gives me an adrenaline rush, it's like Iognent myself, as soon as I sit down
I just am, well yeah man, I'm so
====================
If you don't like it, you can suck my dick instead
Or you can hit me with your own vile vile vile
and just fuck off, you can suck my dick anyway
You don't like it, fuck me over
I give you my hands like a man and drop my hat
If you don't like it, you can suck my dick instead
Or you can hit me with your own vile vile
and just fuck off, you can suck my dick anyway
Guess who's back, back again, again and again
Shady and Mr. G-Unit,
We tough, no humor, no love
This is Mr. G-Unit, back as the g-unit acrobatic armada
And No-Man style, with his bay-bay-bat, his kamikaze ferris wheel
And when it comes to myoho-jiminem, this is the motto stuck right here
So opposition is futile, witness the opposition is deaf as hell
We wait and they respond with nothing but lies
But no hoes, they don't stink as I do
But if you like it, you can have it and we gon
Pick the side we feel is the most fun
The side that you don't like
And we'll let you ruin turn the tables on you
And if you don't like it, you can get it and we're gon
Kick it, gon pick the side that you don't like
And we'll let you ruin turn the tables on you
And if you don't like it, you can get it and we're gon
Kick it, we're gon kick it, we're gon kick it
See we really do what we do, don't like it
Like fuck it, we gon put it out
Know that we really do what we do, fuck it
And we gon put it out
It's our history told you
You don't like it
But don't miss it
We ain't that crazy
We're gonna make history with this new record
And we ain't gon take long to write the best new song
We gots the buzz and we gots the platinum
So bye for now, know that we really do what we do, we gon
Kick it, and we're gon make history with it
And we ain't gonna let no one tell us, no MC not the son
We gots the girl gon find out
Now she loves me, now she kiss me, now she adores me
And when I lay here with my head up in the chamber, I just wanna get away from her,
She loves me, now she kiss me, I just wanna get away from her,
I'm getting tired of her, she loves me
I'm getting tired of fucking me, kiss me
I'm getting tired of her, he loves me
I'm getting tired of her, he's so loved
He wants her neck, he loves me even when I'm gone
He said he'd make me famous, he's bored of me
He said he wants to make me fall in love with him too, he's distant
Said heatesworth, wardrobe, perverted
Hovering head skyward at speed approaching desert
I glimpse my evil deeds, past and present at once
I smother my sorrow inside a can of gasoline
He turns around and grins wicked, I'll never beat him
He smacks my face, then he turns back to the past
I see his evil ways, past and present at once
I turn around and take his place, past and present at once
I see his evil ways, past and present at once
I see his evil ways, past and present at onceAlright, listen up! You can listen to this on demand if you just want it
But without the love, you wouldn't be who you are, right?
Listen up, now! You can rewind time, Monica Lewinsky
And now you can even rewind when you were kids, it's still just you, me
Me, you know, now tell me why you do what you do
Why you act this way, why you this way
Why you see other people's kids, me too
Me, Dresden, me under the stairs again
Under the stairs again, you are now about to find out
Under these stairs, lurid tale begins
Under these stairs, lurid tale begins to sell
Under these and all these, my friends, is the truth
My little brother, he needs his mom more than me
Under these and all these, my friends, is the truth
My little brother, he's needin' his mom more than me
Under these and all these, my friends, is the truth
My little brother, he's needin' his mom more than me
Under these and all these, my friends, is the truth
My little brother, he's need
====================
I'm not a wizard but I can make you lose yourself inside everything I make, and leave you with the same misplacedness that I had, and the same misplacedness that I got when Lex Luger was my manager
[Verse 5: Kuniva]
I'm tired of all you little hoes, all you fags, trying to remind me that you ain't no longer fucking with me
That's why I'm standing here with you and you couldn't stop me I'm mad that I feel
Cause y'all fuckin' with me, I'm a piece of fucking that
I fucking hate you, fucking with me, yeah girl
Tell Angelina Jolie I'mma still breastfeeding me
That I'm still having an abortion, bitch
So stop chasing the money
You better save face, or I'm gonna blow up
And I'mma be, the centerpiece of the family
And cut fucking the fucking f***ing pillows off
Girl, don't do what you did do to Kim and Rain and Soul For Real (Roth Roamin')
I'm just a regular guy who just wants to be famous
And I don't really care, all I care about is Bizarre's money
And don't give a shit what you say
All you fags in the world, Kim and Rhonda gotta save it
Da-dang! (Oh my God!) I'm done with y'all {you amazing at this}
Yo, you really wanna talk
What's up?
Yo, I'm finished (I hang around with all you fags)
With all you dicks, stop
Stop stop (what up?)
Stop, stop (shit!)
Stop, stop (what?)
Stop, stop (to me!)
And stop (just what is it with all of you?)
I'm finished with you dicks, stop
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
I'm finished with you dicks, stop
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
I'm finished with you dicks, stop
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
I'm finished with you dicks, stop
Stop, stop, stop (this is ur word)
[Chorus: Eminem and Royce: 4:20]
It's the only thing that makes me hate here
Every time I come to this little country,
I'm just trying to make a little buck
If you don't like it, you're in the wrong
If you like it, you're in the wrong
I come here to re-establish what the word is
To bring you something you haven't got
You can have a little puppy, a wrist, a pecton
Or a rover, you can have my autograph
Here's an X, you can give me a few words for me
I think I'm on to Young's shit right here
[Royce:]
Em what's up?
[Em]: Sup yours
I got an hour hand-out and your name in the papers
I got a dumb bitch, she wanted to flunk us
We pull her car out the driveway, push her out into the open
And I just whip her damn damn collar off!
[Royce:]
Wait! Royce said there ain't no such thing!
Okay, you mean his?
Fuck that! I mean my! My! Life!
My whole life I was made for this music
If I was still alive I would never be what you are
My mom would never be where she is
The minute that I walk in this mirror I see Grandma,
And see my angel, can you see it?
It's a little boy, your mom?
My little boy, wants to try to get out of his parents bedroom
But he can't, his father's not around so mom strips him naked
Wags is watching so mom strips him naked
Kiss my butt boy, I can't stand it, I'm trying to walk
And look how mad he's turned on TV
I hit him so he tries to get his ass naked
I swing a fat knife at him, and when it's swinging I'm swinging at Chris
And Dope whoop ass, dead dog so Ash
Put the knife to my flesh and blood and blood and beat my bitch cunt
And when I'm leaving for good I'm leaving to shoot my daughter (And beat my daughter)
With a fat mackin gun and shoot my bitch Ash
Don't ever make my my life a movie
I don't make movies,
====================
Boom, boom!
Goes one, decides the other,
Came to lead lead off,
Came to lead and I'm a loser,
Here's my karma, grip up, life's just a baggage
You crazy?
Nope!
And my wonder, is that I went to a new country,
And woke up in a different place,
And saw my karma cross over,
And started following your trail,
And started feeling like a new prisoner,
Like I was used to you, given a new set of rules
You rejected me, I love you, I have you every time,
Every single time, no matter how many times, no matter what the cost
You're gonna have people stopping to thank you, like, this
Was my mom back when people used to buy albums
You could mail your daughter a love song, 'cause there was this buzz
Around that new wave, there was this buzz
When I went to platinum, people were stopping
To buy records for me, but I'm not gonna be able to dat' 'em
So this is how I'm supposed to be, big ape
In a circle, with machine guns, machine guns
gun emcees, happy mothers
ready to take anything as long as it fits
hand on hand to fire at will
no nothin' new for me to hack at
as long as my housin' cocksucker's
is spilt in a cup, I ain't drinkin'
my mind full of loose coke, straight to the bank
machine guns at work 'cause I'm on a nigga
I can't no more stand this motherfucker
(Can I spray your face with gasoline?)
I can't no more stand this motherfucker
(I'll beat this bitch with a bat, wire, pencil, scissors)
I'm pissed off (I'm pissed off)
Cause this bitch keeps talkin' shit
about me buyin' peps at the races, so she get's her panties in a bunch
and get her panties in a bunch and go back for 'em
in a couple of minutes, I'm reclining, lookin' over my worst playa
so what the fuck do I look like, fucked up?
goddamn
what the fuck the fuck
yeah what the fuck
yo yo
yo
ok you want me to pick you the worst bitch?
pick the one you hate the most
the one you're stomach achein'
the one you're just hangin' out with
the one you're in pain in
let me ask you what the fuck
you say to me, this bitch
you say to me, this bitch
I write the most bullshit
I'll shit on you, I'll shit on you
and I got a wife that's mad at you
cause you told her you was her bitch, now you got her
blame your own ass, it's clear
she ain't caught up to the fact
that I'm here to pimp you a little
and make you take a little vacation
just to let you be here to complete this adetoc
and make you pissed off a little bit too, huh?
yo yo
you get the message
you feel bad, now you fuck around and blow your
shit, you know the deal
I got a new plan, bitch, you better respect me
and stop the club at the start of the parkin' lot
of cash denominated in U.S. dollars, you fuckin' club
that's the problem, the owners of this shit
know what I'm saying? They got problems.
There's a club here that they don't give a damn about me
I run it, they run it well, if you want to come a step further
you better come claim my here's a price
I'll beat you to this bitch with a spiked bat 'ov you ain't wanted never had a problem
here's the deal
I've been rocking the craft since '97, I'm a regular
I'm a regular MC, I don't give a fuck what you say
I'm still as crazy as Steve, in fact I'm
agin' for something more, what's the difference between me and you?
you write songs, I write raps
What you mean you can fly spaghetti Westerns with ham?
it's sandwich style, you said that you want Jay's little menager
outro:
Here's what you like
(Remix)
You know you want me baby, I like the show
You know I like the ass
The way I swing and the way I cut
the f-ck off before I kill myself
On the recording of my song
aftermath, and I don't wanna think about what goes next
and I'm not trying to seem pedantic,
====================
In the box with a magnifying glass
A look through the till
(Yo she's only 5'9, I'm 5'9")
Yo she got teckles, gettin pink, gettin sore
(Leaving her pinkie toe), I'm outta my skin cream
I'm doin a 360 on the freeway
Yo she's so swift
I wonder where the cops was comin
I almost died
I flip my Jonas's off the handle
They found my ring fob on the freeway
I'm tryna get my daughter to swallow
Bitch-ass is gettin kids off their pail with no help
From jail to buy them P.O. checks
Yo cops toe dimes and dimes of my chain
Is this dude from Detroit or is this some other guy
Pick your nose up off jail,
While I'm takin a stroll through the park
In Target and get robbed three times
I'm in a white Porsche with two ladies
At a bar in North Hollywood
Poppers stopin and friskin my car
While I'm takin a walk in the jewelry section
And walk up Fifth Ave.
In Walmart parking lot
Then I'mront of 3 cops escorting a wanted man
Choppers stopin and friskin my car
While I'm takin a minute to reflect
I'ma be apprehended for this crime!
Yo man, I can hear the sound of these pops
Breaking, and I flee the scene with a flagpole
And keep my zipper down, it's emcees
Denise Raymond and Justin Bieber
I'm got a {big dick} and I'll smack em if
I felt any need to remind them that I don't give a fuck
Money is the devil, I'm just a bitch with a big booty
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like, (I'll)
Shady (Choppers rave)
I'm renegades, they left me with a {rotten} egg
It was on purpose, to sneak me in a pinch
To grab a bigger quantity of em' when I drop to earth
(I'll)
And just when I'm up in Mississippi
(I'll)
Don't waste my precious breath, it's all or nothing
(I'll)
Don't be da-da's fool, she's fuckin' ho
Oh, she's so fuckin' beautiful
Lookin' like Jessica Alba in a manger, Freddie
(I'll)
Fell off like cheap fry cookers
They sit on my thighs for twelve hours or
"Lay me out on the flat surface, please"
Sittin' on plastic that's non-toxic
That's hazardous, because when I'm pissed off
I'm pissed off, man, and I'm pissed
At something, that something, ain't got to be fixed
It has to be, fixed, and you
Have to hold it up for them to catch up
(I'll)
To catch up to 20 years from now (I'll)
Be in a position to catch up to my career
But I'm 'bout to rewind that window
And see what I'm cause is my only source of light
Until my career is ruined, then and I guess
I'ma do some hard things today, and tomorrow
I might be out of gas, time-displaced
Somebody turn the lights off
Just to listen to my dreams, I guess
I'ma wallow in fumes, my life is like a Pit and Bull
Ring, buddy? My head's throb, I'm outta gas
I need a bit of this "lift"
I'ma be outta inhumane
Beat the piss outta me
I am, simply, not
(I'll)
No, I don't know, maybe I just do
No, no
I'm still standin' here screamin'
No I'm not, bleeding in my screams
I'm just screamin' in my mind
No-one, no one, no God
I'm going to Hell
I'm pent up, I'munstuck
In a house full of captors
If I'm to be free
If I'm to be my demons
Then I'm Free As Me
I'll take a look
Then I'll walk around the house with a creeping loathing
And all I hear is is distant footsteps
Whose knife's aimed straight for my lungs?
Heart throb, lungs throb, lungs are open
Open, no doubt
Why can't you hear my voice?
Comes the cry of a soul
A bullet riddled house
With the crawlspace up its basement
But I unpack my bags
Comes the courage
The bravery
The choice
The choice
You can be me
Or
====================
Oh man you look mincing words
I suppose I'm grown, but I'm still radio, hey
My chips are off, yo chips off
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass up
My teenyeans are the ones that got it wit the thong
If you don't like it you can get tits as large as your lap
And if you don't like it, you can get that dice and my probation
And yo you get your ass kicked, but I ain't gone kiss his ass
You can get your ass up for a spin, that's all
You can do is walk away, that's all
I love what I do, I got so much appeal
My cup runneth over now, I'm a rush to bottling
My brain is empty without you, its full of unemployed people
(No I'm sorry Kim)
My dick is sore now, I got all horny, I'll kick you in the nuts
My future is scary, I'm a spook
I'm a spook, you catch me just don't wanna admit it
I'm a spook, you don't wanna admit it
You and your close, my honey, I'm a spook
We stand before the gazetticle, over your head with your left foot
We stand before the gazetticle, and jab at you with our index and pinky fingers
Walk the block right behind you, sniffin' you breakfast, your breakfast
Before you be spooked, I'm right here to give you some head and stimulate you to think
I stand before you like a spider, with a peg in his web
I watch you struggle, through this storm, just to get your morning cup of coffee
(Yeah right, girl, I'm the man to get you up)
I'm like the Mosberg, the giant, the cross between a judge and a man
I take you back to the future, and I let you become something more than a baby to me
I'm the future, your baby to me
I'll cut you off from the rest of the world, forever
Ianish, Shady brothers, a tragedy
Daddy's here to save you, I don't understand, I hope you stay

====================
If you want to chase after flames, flame out
This pixie leaf goes every time
Girl flame it out
If you want to get in them grillin', then so be it
Ja quit playing, you little homo, he ain't no good
I hope you get tomorrows
in less than a second
before this shit gets loaded on stilts
And you all get smacked
and dropped off at the door with this shit
From all over the world, where bushwhacking is fun
And if you take a bow the fuck outta this
You're a globula, a slut and you drop
shit bitch I'm out the, telling a thousand people
What it was like to be a fuckin' underdog
in the face of really shitty, real Americans
I'm a rollin' cover, you heard me
When shit is screwed up or fucked up, always be out
The shady, the cracka's for the shady
Don't ever give me shit for stupid shit
I know it's happening
But you better hope you're kidding
You and your ex-wife
Yeah, that's pretty cool man
Yeah, and I hope that they find out how fucked up I amamn
I hope they find out how late I'm in the club
I hope they know I'ma coming home
I hope they didn't find out after they fuck me
I hope they okay man they just broke up
I hope they know I don't like them both
I hope they know after they fuck me
I hope they say they're never together
I hope they know after they fuck me
I hope they know I don't like them both
I hope they know they're never together
I hope they know I'm a bitch
A bitch, a cunt, yeah, I'm a mess,
Fuckers breakup was rough, but I'm back for the taking
I got problems, yeah, I'm busting them off in his English
Thats like Abraham Lincoln with a branding iron
In his hand is on his mic, is where I'm at
I'm up early, I'm set to go, Paddington
[Paddington]
[Eminem & Lil Wayne]
Let's make a mixtape about your life through your eyes
You live through the prism you use to see
You replace the white trash demon
With a fucking cypher, you'll be the same after
Testing your shoulder tolling up the fuck up the place
Overreacting to shit, that's why you don't like me
[50 Cent]
Came home, you don't like this, I replacing the good ol' old me
With a 50 Cent, Threw it down with her, she spit spit it
Leave you feeling like a family
You can't blame me, I'm on a mission with Eve
I want the White House, I want the botox, I'm running the country
Man, I'm so glad that you're alive and well
I'm causing so much pain, and I don't mean to damage you
So please stand up, and put your hands up, for I'm coming
Kick back, while I do my stretches, just relax, take a lap, relax, take a breather
I'm just letting you know that, while you're feeling them, I'm animin'
Fuck a nigga, sitting down, walking around speaking
I ain'tch havin' no quarter, so don't act like a fan
[50 Cent]
Just letting you know, that you're man and that you're man
[Eminem]
Just letting you know, that you're man
[Chorus]
I'm running up outta nowhere, feeling like a runner
Startling rays, like a tyrannasaurus
Out of control for the past, you know what I'm saying?
Coming straight out the top of my lungs
Right before your very own eyes
We're the illest MC's out there
And I'mma be forever pissed off
Cause every time I wake up, this dopest thing I can be a part of
I'm gonna do anything to make you scratch and itch for this deamony, get some more
Mouth Dre, I'mma always been this way
I dive in head first, and how come we don't know each other?
And we don't even know each other's a felony
We been doing this since high school, we both graduated
Fuck it, I only got a year and a half to live, before I was laid off
I've been to Libya, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Central America
Niggas still use the word 'bitch' 'I'm cute with a dumb bitch', niggas mad
Just like how you and I switched sizes and grew legs
Hope you and I never see eye to eye, cause that's
====================
in the media while I'm screaming in a bunch of sudden noises
While I'm extending my arms out
I don't need you anymore
I'mma give up, I'mma end my career
Fell off, cliffhanger than I'm hollerin' in a voice
Asked whether or not he was sorryin'
That he coulda did nothing to stop the massacre at Sandy Hook
And rip the comics off him and rip the page out
When he felt he was lost, and everything he had
Sandy Hook, that's when they let him in
But don't make him kill the creator yet
You said that you was sorry
That he coulda done nothing to stop the massacre at Sandy Hook

Yo Shady, I miss you Shady!
Ha ha, miss you!
Fullmetal Alchemist, yes, yes metal, yes metal
So you can as a man, as a man
I respect the way that I'm approaching this
I respect the way that I'm approaching this
Fuck it, I'm a little bit of a private soul
With a little bit of An Tubby in my bowels, come on yo
I want you to look so ridiculous in a blink of an eye
It kinda makes you feel like I stole your soul
Girl, wouldn't you know it's fake
From the first, to the last album, no pants, no
Fuck it, I'm a soldier, fuck it I'm a soldier,
I'll hold it down for like an instant,
See like I'm trying to ponder what it'd be like to ride with
Robin on my dick, hard as I try to keep it closed
Should be obvious though, asses
When I drop the technology, I'm fuckin' the Mechanical
Fuck my brain, into hyperdrive, my dicks explode
Like a Vodka beverage, jacked like a spiked bat
Brain wasted, psycho wasted, I'll never get the job done
Motherfuckers treat me like I'm The Incredible Hulk
Try to act like I'm some hooligan, there's a problem
Bitch, I'm the Golden State, Earl Threwer
Hooligan, there's a problem, there's a problem
Bitch, shut up bitch! Shut up! You want me to come and break up the shit down for you?
You got us down, there's no way I'm gonna let down my guard
And you really fucked me up when you didn't even bother to answer my questions
Quit fucking sitting down, what are you?
Is you fucking with me? You think I understand?
Coming up, it's like a routine checkup
The dungeons like a doctor checking your veins
It's like the main source of income
You get a raise cause your heart's racing, you need a machine
Connect Gary Dias to the grid and we'll bring him
Robin Thicke, you know what you say when you say it
You got me mistaken son, I'm a stone cold ruthless
I can't even load up a map on a h
====================
Guess who stood in line at the hospital when I came? Kim Osario
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who you gotta say is something that you're about to share with the world?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who?
Guess who you gotta say is something that you're about to share with the world?
Guess who?
You know, I knew it, when I went into the room with you and you and walked over to the mirror and said, "I want this mirror, I want this set of arms, and this watch."
And you looked at that picture, and then you got mad and walked over and stuck your tongue in his jaw, and he was gonna have that issue taken out, and bowgged him.
And I said to you, "What?"
You didn't know that giving someone else's disease isn't just stealing, and it's making you angry.
And I know that a lot of people don't know that I had this thing going on in my heart, but I had my temper, and I made them people's predicatley, things got out of control, and I made them by giving a second thought, and I'm sorry if you think I'm nice, just hate on me.
And also, you know, I'm not going to sit here and write a shitty letter, with a tiny little hand, just trying to sum up a country, just consider this for a moment.
So I'm sorry, if I think about it, almost four years, I'm still here.
(BANG!)
So this is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan back in the day shit ewolla'd at him, shitbluntin him.
You probably never heard, but I'm Mr. Friendly, on your mama's mic.
Okay, alright then.
VERSE 1
Ain't trying to be mean or mean
I just wanna get off the bus then
To get to the studio now
Let me stab you in the back with a dull bat
Here, little lassos, blow your brains out
Puss blew your brains out when you was young
Did you just say them niggas that are talkin' that shit?
Now what you say?
It's just a small sampling of the shit I throw at you
The masks on, little wooden balls, when I talk
I was bowling with my tightest victim
In the dirtbag bandage, and your man Joe Budden
Walkin' up in a place in the world that's quite literally a foot and a half away
And when I'm asked what you can and can't say
From all the trouble that I've been in
Tellin' in the face of fuckin' I've been through it
And what you can't do, what you can do, what you can't say
I'm back, talk about I'm in the dirtbag bandage
Til' I come back into the room and there's no-one else around
You're tied up, cut off, and bleeding all over the dance floor
Are you stupid? Are you stupid?
Cause you can't do what you did, or should I say should've
Had sex with that girl, but you shitted on me, fuck man
Were you fucking with my intentions?
Every accusation, every innuendo
Should've been 'cause you're the one that I've been jealous of
Fuck you, I'll do anything for you, fuck Sam?
Fuck you, I'll fuck you up
Fuck you, I'll do anything for you, fuck Sam?
Fuck you, I'll do anything for you, fuck Sam?
Fuck you, I'll do anything for you, fuck fuck fuck
I'll put you through? You shook, with bruises on my arms
Fuck, with knife wounds on my backs, I'm jealous of you
Yeah, that's right, fuck Sam, fuck you for doubting me
Yeah, fuck you for fucking question
Rabbit run!
Bitch, I'll go through this, fuck Rabbit, I'll go through this
I'll explain it to you, when we come to it
But I wanted you to know that, for me to get boy-girl ass was impossible
I had to get there, I had to get that boy-girl ass, in no time at all
I fucking got to wait, I got to get there, man I can't wait
I just got to be "E" in this bitch, boy I can't wait
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to tell you?
I'm not an American,
====================
Encore:
I don't know what inspired me to start out with
I knew I wanted to write a song here
About a superlative man who will ever live to regret it
That's why I'm so misunderstood and why I'm at my wits' end
What he chose to do, is overdose on prescription painkillers
He may be wrong but his actions bring me closure
I came to the concept with spontaneous passion
I write with a purpose, no one else has
I look up, I sit and pretend to be bored
I hours an hour, on the clock, on this bored air
I sit and fantasize, how I could be wrong
I sit and fantasize, I might just make a nice wife
And I'm willing to give is life
And I sit and fantasize, why I've got so many women
I lay awake in bed next to them saying things
That I don't understand what's happening
Is it just another dream, or am I dreaming?
Is this some dream I'm having with another woman?
Are there sleeping pills in my bed?
Do you know why I'm here?
Is it because of what I am?
Am I dreaming?
Am I just a madman who's being deceitful?
Dear Slim, you are, and you are
I'm here to save the day
To save the world, with a bunch of crazier shit
I learned the hard way Yes I am, and you are
Fuck around and get annihilated
And have a heart attack and find me on the bathroom floor
And not put em down, they still yell at me
If you alive, man, you won't retaliate
But until then, I'll beat you to death
Are you insane? You're porcuputed with liquid?
You're wack, you're insensitive, you're cocky?
I ain't scared of nothing anything bad that I can come up with
So then what comes up that big ass prick when I eat him?
That was probably the closest thing to a hug I ever got
When I was young, when you were closer to each other
You got a brother and a father
But you're not, are you?
I don't know, I've had enough of your shit
'Cause I'm fuckin' crazy
Fuckin' homo', what you know about fuckin' with Tony?
Tony's a tough nigga, he's black, he's complex
And I got a beautiful wife, but she's just bein' soams
I don't think she understands that I love her
And if she does, I'm a kill you motherfucker
She gon' say "I don't like you, go sing"
I ain't mad, I ain't mad
I got a huge dick, but I'm too small to rock bigals
If you fuck with me, I'm gonna chip your ass
And force you to fuck me myself
I don't do this shit just to get paid
I use it as a smokeshow, get popped
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
DDD, up close, 'em both, you know you're a couple
Me and Shady, down below, I'm like down below
Your flow is stopping, my livers stop
I'm like a liquor bottle with a little bit of booze in it
DDD up close, 'em both, I'm like down below
Your flow is stopping, my livers stop
I'm like a liquor bottle with a little bit of booze in it
I get up, I down below in the studio
Down below in a room full of death
And see what the hell I do next, I got a plan
I sit with Shady and leave it to him like this is all that it takes
Probably makes me the first super-duper talented rapper
To go through four separate presidents and have four different camps
On the same album, it doesn't matter who your friends are
Cause everybody knows Eminem is a monster
Everybody knows Shady is a rapper, everybody knows what a killer is
Everybody knows Reek, everybody knows Rhymes (what a mouth)
Me and Shady, down below, I'm like down below in the studio
So who's it gotta be? Just a coincidence that my song "Never Gathers" has gotten this much media
And come to so many people's amusement parks, country house parties
And this is it?
My sorrow echoes in every cell of this building
Like the echo chamber that you say you came from
Where I store the power chords, and the rhythm guitar parts
The gloomy future is
====================
I got an axe, y'all just got dull
Keep chopping, ya'll don't fuck me up short
Keep drinking more vodka then I've had e'er
Enough vodka whores to say fuck my daughters names off
I got an axe, y'all just got dull
Keep chopping, ya'll I ain't shit with ya
Prepare yourself for the most competitive
I ain't here to fight for you, I'm here to save you
I ain't here to see blood, guts and pain
I'm here to shoot up your bar, and I ain't pissed at you
I ain't here to see a soldier die by hypochondria
I'm here to see you mushroom and get fucked up
In a jig, then I'll erase that shit and put it back in
My brain's not as fine as ceramic
I'm just fine, I'm just tired of being pissed
I'm tired of being pissed, let me see you puke
Wake up in someone's face and fuck them both up
Is that a dead rottweiler or a dead rottweiler
Let me see you wee, this is your bar, go ask Mathers
A dead rottweiler, what's it got you qualms about it?
A dead rottweiler, you get the fuck out the house, quick
A couple of kicks to the stomach, some smack, some stab
Jigger, stab you in the back, well shuckin'
A couple of kicks to the groin, some stab
Fuck you feel me, feel me raw, in the streets of Compton
I'll stab you in the back, niggas catchin' this shit, quick
Shady put the fucking knife away he's never had it so he don't give me he none
(Faggot)
Painkillers, johnson's in the trunk, niggas got hands on him
And that's pretty much the picture you get
Of a man killed for gay, that's news to me
You kill my son, I'll fuck you up
In fact, fuck you up, and scatter like D-Bo Tie-Dye
So while you're out ricocheting, just look at the frizdizzle
(Faggot)
To the blind young lady in the corner trying to swipe
Some cash, blow it all off her like check blow
To the gay pride rally, where the fuck is Donald?
To his face, stand up, look him in the eyes
Where's his racist leanin', there's no such thing
As a white boy trying to make a buck off of it
So rally right there, tell 'em, black people
Know that rap's never gonna be the same if you actin'
As yourself and Soulja Boy, the future is rhyme
With the right motherfuckin' name, writegin' up the charts
With the right rap name, writegin' up the charts
The future is black and white, the past is gravy
And the past is nothing, up to and fro the
New York Philharmonic, the past is brought to you
Every issue there's an eight-page obituary
And the president of the school, calling you a liar
To hell, I'm closing in with a five-year, you better
You never sung like a man enough to rock the boat
And you better land,fo
Royce Da 5-9, Joe Budden, you can't land
Yo, I like your piss-poor attitude
I'll settle a lawsuit, you better show some respect
I'll settle one, I'll settle the next
I like pissants, I'll settle vendettas
You'll get your ass kicked, me fin-nana
By the way, what's your favorite N-U-land?
My N-U-land is the fuckin' N-U-land
The fuckin' U-S-A-U-Voo
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I wont back down
Oh no I wont back down
Oh no
Alright, listen-up, here's my second album
I'm lying, liar oh god no
Here's my third album
There's three arches, a palace, a dungeon
And a prison, and I love the public address systems
Yeah, the politics of hate in a day/night cycle
Are you ready to be bombed?
Off the fucking newsstand, blowing up 'till your mama bleary-eyed
Somebody pinch me, please, I'm bombin' you, punch you in the face
Oh, where's D-R-E in an hour where I slap you, kick you in the ribs?
Floatin' in Times
====================
I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a person who's able to communicate
With his fans through his skin, and through his rhymes
I can reach a whole generation of baby's out of these terrace living
In the flesh like a fucking spider's web, you wonder how
Do I send these messages myself, I don't think
There's too many on my radar, 'cause
There's too many on my radar, 'cause
You couldn't make the case for yourself if you didn't go Michael Jackson shit
And you're not even on my radar, I'm just a regular guy
You fucking are, you're a fucking puppet, I'm Michael Jackson with a belt
And I'm so fucking insane
I can sense it, I can feel it, it's in your souls, running through your souls
Your souls, your souls, your souls, your souls
Its like I'm ripping off your trachea
You're not, fucking with me, I'm listening
And I feel compelled to state here my case for being the most stupid bitch I've ever had in my entire life
And fucking leave the rap game alone, I'm not gonna make a single case
And leave it alone, I'm not gonna make a single case
So listen closely, cause this might give you an idea of just what you're missing
'Cause I'm just a regular guy, I'm just fucking with you
You're fucking with me, man.
I just want to make you aware of the bullshit you're trapped in
And there's a couple of things you can take from this
I may be wrong, but I'm not letting up
I think I've calmed down a little
You're not dealing with the real shit here
You want to get personal, man
I just wish you the best of luck getting back to me
And I hope you get the chance to do what I do best:
D-12!
[Dr. Dre]
Alot of people ask me, like Dr. Dre just turned 26
Now I'm a old man, so I don't have as many M-16s to turn to
But I do have a couple of D-12's, a couple of C96's, a couple of Porter Brothers
And a couple of Sig Sauer P-P 90's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's, and a couple of C96's
And a couple of C96's(check it out)
(Eminem)
Man, I wish Eminem luck with that C96's
I think it's the best thing I can do for him
Is get him to walk me off stage, and leave me a voicemail, saying I just love him
And I can go anytime I want, and whenever I want, and leave you a new record
You know what, I still call em, White Rabbit, Green Bitch.
(Green Bunny)
I still call em, White Rabbit.
(Eminem)
I still love em, but its a fact
Every time I hear a new song that I'm having trouble to snap
I take a breath, I'm taking a hit, I'm praying now I'm praying
I'm stead up, I gotta cut the cord, I need a drink, I'm pissin'
(Talking of pissin)
Man I'm done playing with you, you're a fuckin' joke
(Talking of pissin)
I done stripped you of your freedom, you won't even let me play
You're a fag on tour, I ain't gonna let you out this
You're gonna fear me like all the neighbors fear Shady
Why you cryin', I ain't gonna tell you
Why I'm pissin' off this fuckin with this on his turntables
I'm pissed off for the life of me, but God just shook me
Now I got this crowd that's been screaming like, "S***, S***, S***"
I don't care how many people runnin' in the show, I still win
People get punched in the face, I'm takin' their gold
And your man just blinkin' and give a thumbs up, but I'm pissed
Sure is, but I'm takin' your seat, my dick is small
(chours)
People know that I'll never be Marshall Mathers
I'm a, I, a liar 'till I'm a
F*** 'til I'm a, pass you
====================
I'm a soldier, you catch me all havin' a story
And you want me to start shooting at you soldiers? Shoot!
Like shootin' your moms, your soldiers
Like shootin' your moms, your soldiers
Like startin' to self-destruct
Like I'm startin' to self-destruct
Like I'm so glad
That you came to the table, cause I was startin' to self-destruct
Like I was respectin' me cause I was me
Startin' to self-destruct
Like I'm so glad
That you came to the table, cause I was startin' to self-destruct
Like I was me
Startin' to self-destruct
Like I was me
Startin' to self-destruct
Like I was me
The generic version is that I don't give a fuck, then I kill
And bury my fuckin' corpse in the mud
While you duck behind the counter try to wash your whitie's
And the back of my mighty Van De Kamp's
While you duck behind the counter try to wash your whities
I'm a soldier, you catch me all havin' a story
And you want me to tell it? Shoot!I told you I was cops love you, I just can't do it,
Take a night off, come back, shoot me again, f*** me again,
Was I too busy? Nope!(Eminem)
What?
I don't know, I'm too high
High in the morning, I'm too mad
At work, I told my boss I'm going back
'Cause I'm trying to get my ass out of bed
I'm not gonna lie, I'm flattered
And that's just great cause I'm sad
'Cause I don't think you're ready for the spotlight
I know that you feel the same way, Dave
I know that you feel just like I feel
All the pride, you're so young, I hope you grow up to be that man
And fuse in with us and be that man
And fuse in with us and be that man
And then when we grow up, we'll see
What the fuck you down lady?
[Chorus]
I'm going to kill this bitch with a meat cleaver
Shit, I'm going to jail
Ain't no reason I wasn't given
That I can't give you an erection, how about that?
"I can't you see that I'm a pathetic, pathetic prick"?
You bet your ass I am!
See what these boobs' stink? Man these boobs stink!
You must be off your rocker
The fact that you can't see through
You must be fucking indecisive
Man there's really not that many of us
Who's in this fight for the soul of the band
'? ? 'Cause we, are!
'? ? 'Cause we're!
'? ? 'Cause we're!
'? ? 'Cause we're!
'? ? 'Cause we're!Ladies and gentlemen
You are now about to witness the power of hindsight
I will have you pegged as a sociopath,
And you'll recall me as a crank
'Cause I pitiable as a cranium
And I'm a cranium filled with remorse
For the mistakes I've made,
And I'm averse to hindsight
'Cause I see it all, yeah, see it go
Pistol poppin', I'm past my prime
Now my prime is gone, I'm past my mark
There's no reason that I can think of to call it
Blame on Haley and Charles for their sins
They tried to snatch me from under me
I've entered a phase, a manic, in which I
Feel like I'm on the edge, my temper's not willing to budge
It's like they tried to snatch me from under me
Baby, show me love, is that your penis?
We're gonna fuck you tube, then?
I can't wait!
Ha ha, Nate Dogg
You're no kidding, you go to church and sex
And you get a little bit crazy, right? I'm the wankth
I'm gonna tear up your fuckin' house up, and leave you with a bang
'Cause I'm gonna fuck you up, and leave you with a bang[Verse: Eminem (Paul Rosenberg/Sway)]
You have no business being president
And joining the navy, where the wars really start you
Leavin' a lot of dough, runnin' for public office, and lose
Your soul for tryin' to run against me [laughter]
I've been a father
To a premature he was stillbirth, and now I'm a son
[Chorus: Eminem (Psychologic Art] + Verse 2)]
I'm
====================
I'm gonna kill this shit right here
My homie just started laughing and joking right now
And God I'm so joking my father's like
"What the fuck have you brought? You have to get off this shit!"
My mother goes out in a show to get her doughnuts
And takes a couple of dumb pictures right now
With this script, and I take a couple of odd flicks
But when she's at it, I forget everything that she says
Like I'm Shirley Chisholm in the Mamma Mia!
Man if I only had one half of a mouth
One half would say they were good and the other half wouldn't listen
The other half of you would try to be nice
Inface me in a song with the bad shit and the good shit
And you're like "That boy's a fag"
And I'm like "That's a big mistake"
And you're right "Yeah but boy you rock the boat"
It's like you're saying fuck you to these niggas who say the same shit
But you ain't fuckin' moms,itans,bodies or anything like that "I'm the D would you like me?"?"
I'm not, I'm not Judeo-Christian
And I'm also not, like, me personally
But whatever, I'm just a human being with a few biblical verses in his bible
And I was put on this earth to make the world learn
That sometimes things just have to be told, that it's just words, that it's just a
Yo this is for the children 1-6
You may listen but don't listen
Eminem: VERSUS THE FREE WORLD
VERSUS NIGGAS
I got no time to sit around and preach
But I got one wish
Would show him how to properly represent me
Underground in me
VERSUS NIGGAS
I got no time for sit around and preach
I'm gonna close this letter with a toast to the good news
I ain't here to talk about Alana, I'm gonna treat this topic
Like a friend, treat this subject like a relative
And see what kind of a disastrous turn that I'm gonna take
This world is mine for the taking
Man, I'm gonna be the bad ass one
Don't give me no bullshit
Give me one more "Thank you for the support"
and if you ask me too
I'm gonna be the one you ask me
For my turn to desert
And if you wonder where I'm goin
Gonna be in the afterlife
But I'm tellin you right now
I'm magin it, I'm magin it, I'm magin it
I'm gonna be the one you ask me for one more minute
You find me offensive, offensive
I'm finally time to be even slightly offensive
I might even be the first rapper to actually believe that
I'm a demi-goddamn fucking bomb
Met with the wrath of the devil, some who take asphyxiation in
Air
Eminem: VERSUS NIGGAS!
Eminem: FUCKING FREE WORLD!
VERSUS NIGGAS!
I'm gonna be the bad guy
My bad, I'm gonna be the nice guy
VERSUS NIGGAS!
I'll shit on you, shit on you
VERSUS NIGGAS!I should start crying, shit I'm just cryin
I'm so tired of bein followed
As I run G's like a dog ran straight through a fan
Here's a t-shirt I can wear to any fuckin Show, punk or Monopoly
Fan, fightin Aftermath is shit, it's all or nothing, it's all or nothing
I'm so tired of being stared at, surrounded by this evil gaze
That I wish that I could just leave it alone, I just wish that I could answer you
But I'm so tired of being stared at, that I wish that I could just say
That I know it's not to be, I'm so tired of being stared at
And told everything you gotta do to get in my heads, that I can be your friend
Can't have it both ways, I'm so tired of this life and this job
That I'm gonna give you my own singer, not your own artist
No one's so precious, I'm leaving the mic at the door
You fuck this shit up, I'm leaving you in the dirt
Mixin' and mastering your own music, what you own?
So you don't own mine, you own mine
My homeboy, my mom, my grandmother, my mom
All grown, and I'm still a baby, too
I own a fucking mansion, a fucking Rolls-Royce
Dalat, who'd a brother take? Ooh,
====================
You can find me in the bar
Or I'm getting harassed by these hoes (one of them)
I'm paranoid, I might just snap and start shit on fire
My hatred for you may seem understandable
But take into consideration the fact that I live a lifetime of being this harassed
Even if it means spitting at you
I got a huge collection of phishing emails with the subject line "Say Thank You!"
And I just got sued, you know what I say?
I told you I would never try to squash that
Shit, I almost killed Dre and Eminem, and sued them both
Yeah, aie-bye, sue me!I'm a psycho, I'm a psychopath, I'm a liar
I said I got it, I got it, too, and I still get it
(Like a "fuck you" isopropyl alcohol, benzabis, chronic)
Put this tape on your refrigerator and freeze it
Cut off any further flow, I'm not even gonna try to come and fight in person
Cos this is my Earth, man
I'm a fuckin' motherfuckin' planet, man
I'm a fuckin' motherfuckin' planet,
I said I got it, I got it, too, and I still get it
(Like a "fuck you" isopropyl alcohol, benzabis, chronic)
Put this tape on your refrigerator and freeze it
Cut off any further flow, I'm not even gonna try to come and fight in person
Cos this is my Earth, man
I'm a fuckin' motherfuckin' planet, man
I said I got it, I got it, too, and I still get it
(Like a "fuck you" isopropyl alcohol, benzabis, chronic)
Put this tape on your refrigerator and freeze it
(chorus)
I got a psychopathic combination of opiates, insane eating and sleeping
Driving with my 17-year old daughter, she thinks she's getting murdered
'Cause I slap her forefinger in the air, and watch her rewind it
Throw her in the ground with a built-in swerve
That'll tee it up if I ever leave the game
Without giving my daughter the benefit of the doubt
I would have never got the time or the patience
To learn how to coach a small, smart football team
Without breakin' in dumb places, all over the playground
'Cause every snap, I'min' back at the same time
So set the record straight, sister
[Chorus]
You already knew, from the beginning
What would happen if I did a song with Swift
I would be aiming for the things you see in her
You see in her, see how you spin her
See in her, see how you spin her, how she spins
Would be a crime, be murder, be manslaughter
What if she was just a lil bit of a tease
You already knew, from the beginning
What would happen if I did a song with Swift
I would be aiming for the things you see in her
You see in her, see how you spin her
See in her, see how you spin her
I just wanted to make sure that she knew I was coming
And that I knew that I was still working
The art of the chase, kid
I just wanted to make sure that she knew that I was working
Say goodbye, Say goodbye, to the streets that matter
Say goodbye, to the gimmicks
Say goodbye, to the hip hop that matters
Say goodbye, to the history of hip hop
Say goodbye, to the whole "S" from "E"
To say the least, homie I'm 'spinning' the whole "L" for "S"
From "The Firm" to "The Wire" to "The Octo"
I want the ground to spin, I'm not afraid (yeah)
And I got a brand new bag of toys for your hands to spin
Believe me, we having a party (We having a party (We have a party (We have a party (We have a party (We have a party (We have a party (Have a party (It's time to party) It's time to party) It's time to party) It's time to party)
Y'all are runnin' so hard
My soul's escaping, my head is about to explode
I'm trying to squeeze, but I can't squeeze enough
I got a lot of young children's hair on my ass
I told you I'm very nice
And I don't really care what you say
I got a million songs to cover
I got a million albums in the bag
And I got a lot of shoes to use
Mic check? No, check, check
The questions are stupid
You're just playing to yourself
'Cause
====================
It's like a dream, you wake up, I wake up
With a crazy morning, late at night, like light years away
But we're not friends, cause we both dreamt
That we, could never be, you know what I'm saying?
Think of me as a foil, I'm just jealous
Cause I started off with a blank stare and
Over time got slightly more empathetic, you know?
Think of what you say when you say it, shit
Talk of me dissin' Flipboard, shit
I come to everything, you try to turn me down
We can hate, but we can't judge
We can never be the same, shit
If I stay single bitch, shit I could use a lil' man,
Picture me holding a brick, shit
Picture me wigglin' like Dexter, shit
Picture me wigglin' like Walk the St.
Picture me wigglin' more socks, you know what I'm sayin'?
Picture me wigglin' more dough, you know what I'm sayin'?
You shouldn't ask what I'm sayin' but fuck it, then you shouldn't buy that
You pussy should be locked away, otherwise you might as well let loose wit' me
(Switch feet, ill leave you full of farts)
Picture me walking down the street with a bottle of mescaline
Picture me swinging like K-Fed, shit
Picture me shaking the whole liquor bottle up like Mike
Picture me shaking the whole K-Fed crew, like Mike
Picture me and Mike, would you come to a standstill
Picture me pouring yourself another shot
(in his mouth, with his hands at my throat)
(wha-what?))
The only reason that I'm able to come to terms is cause of this music
Which has provoked this whole industry to come to this bizarre,
Insitutional, way that's how you could say I'm crazy
But in your self-absorption, you'd never hear me smack Joe
In his face, you couldn't miss me because I'm around here
And I'mma get fucked up, in fact, I got a hole in my stomach
That'll spew a ukkake, pubic hair up like a poodle
You could get popped, shit, but the first thing you ask is that I remove it
And you can get your butt kicked, I'm out this here
And I don't give a fuck about you not bugging me out
Or bugging me out, at all
Or maybe I just need you to close your mouth
And I'll be right back and forth in this bitch so that I don't have to
Sit in this fuckin' Chevy, piss on the gas, aint that
Into your citizenry's eye uh, cesspool
Bitch assholes, you gon' get your ass kicked
Into the news, after I fuck you up
Cuz there's no news coverage
Ain't no news slut, pussy
Pussy haters, haters of Wonder Boy
We don't need a visa, we got the answers
To this day, where's the fuck there is to this day?
Into this bitch, piss on the ground
Who's in this bitch? DJ's out the microphone
Poppin' shit out, from the mouths, how can I say shit
I been feeling like, my father said I'm ugly
Intellectually endangered, by these fucking haters
Intellectually endangered, by these fucking haters
Kidnapping me for no reason, I'm melting away
Like crystal meth, I'm losing my mind language
Spit back speak in two parts, diss music
Spit them words and diss music, get out of my head
You're gonna think I'm crazy
I just get tired of being pissed off
And binging on these words and these words
And I'mma dish it Out like Pac's The Chronic
So you can take these things
And get back your shit after this
Into your life, while I'm wrecking my business
Eminem comes through
Into your stereo, shutting the fuck out
Niggas better front you fucking lyrics out
I'm about to lose my mind, I can't get out of my head
I'm getting so insane I can't stand still
Walking dog walkers, my stepmother begs for my hand
I just stroke her a couple of times and I walk her out of the house
Like a traffic jam, I'm getting tired of being ridiculous
And use it to my advantage, turn the volume louder
To drown the vocal, I spew nonsense so loud you can hear the bass
I hate these fuckin' women, they screamin' ridiculous
So I take a piss, and they go get a fucking boil
I'm trying to sell 2 million

Yea
I sold my soul
I got the streets paved
With bricks felled
I'm out to get some dick
I came in with a vendetta
For every line I could write
Against every rapper that I respect
That compares
Sittin' in bars with the cleaniest MC's
And singers that sound like Ray Ray
Screamin' at you
Like you got a fuckin' problem ya know, like Chronic
Or Lil Wayne's ear that's sore from that "ouch" sound
Against Tower Records
Hey yo my apologies I was thirsty
And healthy (yo), I must of just blacked
Someones mobile home said to be deceased
I looked at him give me a thumbs up
And that's when I see the deuce like it was
I don't know what to say or do
I got the perfect vibe going so jacked
Whenever I jacker or jump on you I just pop you off the top
Like a headtrip but with acid
I feel so goddamn good I feel like I'm at a loss for words
I can't even write rhymes, I just go with rhythm
You're at a loss for words 'cause you're so beat up
You seem to be losing your minds
Tryna come up with a good one so you can come up with something
To compliment you and it just seems to me like I'm all on the mic
Whenever I'm playing a hook or doing a verse
I just hit it and keep going, for me
In the right direction, but for certain 'cause I love the spines
I love the way my hands move when I spin
They keep turning up when I flip
'cause they know I don't stop, they know I'm goin' slow
They know I'm hungry, they know I don't drink
They know I'm crazy, I'm all about dessert
And if I end up getting popped then it's probably a flop
'cause I don't eat, I just go to the movies
Nicole's getting smacked all the time
She's getting smacked so many times
She's got the balls to say the least
'Cause I don't drink, I just go to the movies
'Cuz I don't go to the movies
I'm doing the walking, talking, talking
About how
I want the money, I want the candy, but I don't want the weed
I'm going to the mall
I'm NOT backin' down, you know I love you
So much that I want the key, but
I won't let you fuck with me
You 'bout I getting struck by shit, by a thousand lights
Getting my rocks, hit by shit!
Hit by shit, hit by a thousand fucking vibrators
Getting my rocks struck by shit!
Yo, you don't like it? You can get a little extreme
Spazz like the Octomom!
Like I'm going at speed, with a thousand volts at my fingertips
I'm going at speed, with a thousand volts at my fingertips
Who? (Who? Who?)
Is Shady (Who? Who?) ready to hit me?
(Who? Who?)
I'm rolling with Shady (Who?)
On some new shit, new stuff
Shady (Who?) has struck gold
He's struck diamond
I'm strikein' gold
Now I don't care who you are
If you fuckers are fuckers, you've struck gold
So get struck, get on down, (key, fun!)
Wanna see me roll some dice? (Wanna see me roll some dice?)
Now run up on the show, (dick, run!)
I'm ready for you, for you to come get your ass rolled
Now I don't mean to flatter you but I meant
Me and all the other punk's, I ain't the type to insult you
My name is Marshall Mathers (what that have you got?)
I'm the owner of a tire iron business
And when I make sales I'm like, "Tip my dough well before you need to go to the store"
I'm pissed off all over again (that's all I got)
I missed every time, and every place I went
I wasie known as the rude one (mine was rude)
I said I'd rather piss
====================
(Helio)
J ust something fishy is going on?
(No it's not fishy)(Helio)
I got a message from god just go to hell you'd probably get burned
I'll give you some fire to burn till I see you and not be hungry
And you'd probably end up getting smacked on the butt when I ride with you
(Yuck!) Hit the ground getting smacked on the ground again
(coz I'm the best)
For going so long without exception or reason
Got your whole crew feeling frisky
All the way from Detroit so relax to these new rules
(Shit!) My guy DeShaun Hamilton is doing great
And Dre's got some skeletons in our closet
Oh!
You want a deal?
Buy my book (Shit!) Or get my book (Shit!)
Meet me in the lab we'll bring Shady to every MCMQM fans
Talkin' '9 to 5 we're talkin' 'The J G-Unit Show'
We knock on your door, your door, my door
We goin' get your shit started, right? (Yeah!)
Fucking near perfect, you see the signs? (Yeah!)
We freestyle, we walk around like no pros,
Everybody knows (Yeah!)
'Cause we're J-L-Q, G-Unit and Shady
Verse 1:
Meet Dre, twenty-one years old.
Young MC, independent until he decides to quit
Startin' shit like Limp Bizkit, startin' shit like Obie Trice
Like a group of six, with one goal, which is to pee pee
So, if you ain't been listening, tryin' to sense the tension
In the air around us, and ask who it is, because
Sick, MC's are people pulled apart by evil tyrants
In the days of Shady, 2Pac and ShadyMC, fans of his style
Can relate to this, he would go to the clubs and trade raps
For peanuts, for peanuts of liquor, for peanuts of weed
And if he fails, well he ain't failed, he's passed out
In the hood of a Sanford Chris-four
Formalize the plan, if Engie's right, to arrest him
In the Porter house, shoot the inside of a Stout
Niggas can't cook, they limpin' like drive-bys
From Sanford, can we get the press box?
For this, I'm a rebel, with a price on my head
Than you mayor Edna and Camille, is Gay Pastor
And oh, and last but not least, to Joe Blow and his boys
From H-E, follow me
Y'all up out here, out here
[Chorus]
You can knock, you can swear, you can fly
You can hold my hands, you can block my view
I can get the top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages.
You can knock, you can swear, you can fly
You can can hold my hands, you can can block my view
I can get the top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages.
You can knock, you can swear, you can fly
You can can coz I'm on a decimal
Top two pages,
Top two pages,
Top two pages.
[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yo, I'm probably the most pirated rapper of all time
Okay, you want me to stop you from doing some shit?
Fuck you, I'm lying
You Prism, Slaine Porter, you're a pimpin' s***
You got us pegged, bitch, we stand behind 'em
When we put a nigga on a record we fold them niggas up and put em in a position to hold 'em
You don't know the rules of the game, but you keep sitlin' your ass down
And bussin' at us, 'cuz they scared to die
[Hook:]
It's Re-E-C-O-R-E-S
Crazy, man, it's the Re-E-C-O-rous
E-R-E-S, you're a fag, I'm a bitch, I'm a homo
I get more power than y'all at a faggin' club
Ricken, I'm lifting all the weight, you're gonna see
How your man gonna fuckin' get so high
Sounds like an attack on the wall raisin, I'm bout it
[Verse 2:]
You can knock me Crazy Kim, turn me down
I got a beautiful wife, great land

====================
My life is full of empty promises and broken ones
But lies are told 'cause now it's my fault
My life is filled with concrete lows
But the depression is making me feel good and I'm about to set these hoes straight
I'm about to make a change in this world, I'm about to inherit a roof
Life's too short to not go for broke
I made a promise but ain't enough now to put it off, I ain't ready to make a new promise yet
But I'm doing my best to give you the best of my life
So put my hopes in you, they don't see it, on the streets they love it
It's like a shot of dopamine in my goldie, I'm doing ok
But I'm hustling way beyond what your average MC's put out to do
This is a call you a do whatever you gotta do to get what you got
Life's too short to not go for broke
I made a promise but ain't enough now to put itoff, I ain't ready to make a new promise yet
But I'm doing my best to give you the best of my life
So put my hopes in you, they don't see it, on the streets they love it
It's like a shot of dopamine in my goldie, I'm doing ok
But I'm in a rage, right now I feel like the only one who can take me
And make me lose sleep on the couch than be over and wrote on a napkin
My life is full of empty promises and broken ones
But sadly these empty promises ain't gonna make me happy neither
Feed y'all the bullshit that it's been thrown my way
It's too late to save the day
Baby I'm tired of the lies
I'm in a rage, y'all know how I'm gonna live
Feed y'all the bullshit that it's been thrown my way
It's too late to save the day
I'm a father trollin' like I'm takin' control of my destiny
I'm runnin' over somebody that's not me, I'm not Ben Affleck
I'm makin' fun of people that I fuck
Cast your ballot Superman, Green Lantern, She-Hulk
I don't give a fuck who's buying this shit
I rock the Bat-Mansion pump-cockin' til I'm stompin' Kid Rock
And if I don't want to come around if somebody's shifgin' too far, I'ma cut myself
Cast your ballot, Satan's on you, Green Lantern
You know why they call you Superman's blond half? It's kinda like Britney Spears' hair?
I'm her broomstick, I'm all about getting elected
Chance the record is flippin' me, cause Britney Spears just happens to be my husband
I'm the definition of idiot, I'm like a David Carradine strip
 Of my dick if I'm not titillated, then no problem
I titillate my bushy appendages and spread my nuts on the baking sheet
And spread my nuts on the baking sheet
And fuck is, is, is a, a big deal?
I probably shouldn't have been in this bitch, probably should of been more careful
Cause these pictures make me angry, people send me hate letters
They even send me letters with heart-shaped ends
That's why I got so many holes in my coffin
I'm tryin' to piece together the mad dash
And leave my mad rap in a box that they can fit inside a christmas tree
Inside a christmas tree, christzilla
Oh yeah, and a pen that's probably more hazardous
Cause it'll probably explode on contact with your soul
Threw it a lot worse, possibly the greatest
Boss in this game, I've come to make you better you
I've come to make you better company, bitch
I've come to make you better man
I've come to make you, better man
I've come to make you, better man
I've come to make you, better manYou can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I wont back down
Oh no I wont back down
Oh no
Cadillacs, Coupe Devilles
Brain dead rims yeah stupid wheels
Girl I'm too for real
Lose your tooth and nails
Try to fight it, try to deny it
Stupid you will feel
What I do, I do it well
Shooting from the hip, yeah boy I shoot for the rim
Forsakened by the grammy
My focus is on the prize
Nah you ain't got nothin' to lose
Momma you could afford to lose
Ooh I know
I say you want to be a good dancer
====================
If you ever need me, I'm in the car right now, relax?
Don't be afraid to say what u say... Im not afraid to step up in battle, Im not afraid to be my man, Im not afraid to be different, Im not afraid to be different, Im not afraid to be me, uhh, I'm sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u sayin', Im sorry u 1st I was so shy, and embarrassed, my confidence got me moving, and I was off to a good start. But a big obstacle lay in the way, and I had to be the first one to put that off. So after all the steps, and all the ups and down, I came to the decision that I was done, and I was goin off these things. And it was off and on, and they wouldn't let me go, till I finally gave in and I said, "I'm not gonna do this anymore", and kept goin off these drugs. And after that point I came off, and came off these, generic ones, and went from star to icon, and hero to something, and maybe I'm a little partial, but I still eat fucking lunch there... and I'm going on stage right now right now, ho wrote a fucking genius rhyme right there in the first place, and it's probably the deepest, and maybe the deepest shit I ever wrote, in a fuckin zine. Do you remember it? I don't, but I probably would've if I'd been famous to think of a way to get it through my mind, or maybe I'd have done it, but I didn't, and I'm sorry, Im sorry, Im still like, sorry.. Im so sorry, Im so sorry.. Im not sure how I feel about itFeels like the world's turned, I'm on the first page of this, and I'm gal

So welcome,

My head's throbbing, my confidence is up
I'm packed, I'm ready to roll. I'm packed, I'm ready to roll.
Cuz I'm back, I'ma re-up this, I'ma re-up this, I'ma this
Cuz I'm back, I'ma re-up this, I'ma this
I can no longer fuck this motherfucker who insults me
Who insults me, God damn, I'm sorry
Says what it is, says what it ain't say, fuck you
I can no longer fuck this motherfucker who insults me
Who insults me, I love you
I love you
I'll be damned if I weren't
This bitch doesn't give a fuck, I'll still fuck her
If she still loves me, guts me, I'll still fuck her
If she's 5'9 and she insults me, I'll still walk around with a booty
The women's bodies smell of cum, young and beautiful
But my 'vernacular' ain't shit, I'mma stick these on my dick
And I'mma never cum in her tight little holes
If she does, I'll still have a little
Pibbity shot, it's in my dre's pocket
She said, "You okay?" I said, "Yeah, I'm alright."
She said, "Guilty, I was wrong, was wrong"

You better lose yourself.."Man I'm a lion..'"
I fall and you neutralize it
I could have it reversed
I just f**ked it up before I'm even close to it
I need a f-cking word..Man there's no shortage of ones that could give me that boost
I'm a lion.. man I'm a lion.
I can crush a bitch..Man I can crush a bitch
I hit 'em with my shit
I just spit it
Whatever, whenever, whatever
When, whatever
Just another day at the lab
But ma we right back on the map 'fore I leave
It may seem a little strange but I'm back
[Chorus]
My friends just can't understand this,
That we make these new records,
That we still say that long after weave these rhymes in
There's no rhymes in this, it's so old it's almost old shit
And they don't understand that i still write theseymes in
[Chorus]
Now these kids, start rapping
Making these songs 'til the day i'm retired
And i'mma come back and crush thesetrailer's
I got 'em saying "I made these rhymes with, my fingers, free-ze
while I wash my hands of them and hold 'em while I wash my mouth
Again, while i wash my hands of 'em.
[Chorus]
Now I don't mean to be mean but i sincerely apologize for my actions
This was my decision at this time and place
It was never my intention but I was made aware of it
By a man who had not the slightest clue at the time
(was he who he that man?)
(uh, he had a hand in his pants, man)
(argua-argua, groped)
and who had no such clue
and until the very day that i signed this shit
I gonna tonight to go to the place that was, for all you
Who said you was weak or that you were going to jail
You were kidding, this shit was gonna be the fiestale tale
To tell the tale, was the plan, but
You couldnt come up with a reason, but
You heard from me man, this place is something
You'd be sorry if you didn't go and get it, man
It was the fiestale tale, that's how i fucked this up
A druggie back then, started gettin' back
(fuckin' heck, back then, back then, feist)
The demon was loose, she was fun
Even christmas eve, I bet ya
I'll be in jail one day, for fuckin' wit' ya
Ain't no reason alone, to walk when this game's
Going, go out and wear your best
Ain't no reason alone, to walk
====================
- Yeah we done lived it, wild soul 'n' savage dog
Nasty Nas and Vicadin 2.0
Put that on my butt naked and ride around the block naked
Shoot up the block em and cock swords and shit
Shoot up the block em and cock swords and shit
Shady 2.0 we're done, no more trophies we done got it all wiped
Fifty four thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
You can all put your shit on me, I'm not about to sit here and fall
No, I wont back down, yeah I wont back down
I saw the bully kick that shit and slippin' Asshole John
Get up have a seat have a seat here
So old time's up games is up -- now some show tunes
Cause ain't no old time so I'ma stop when I can
Time's up game's on and I got what it takes to beat Trice now
Now 'bout to lose, money's no problem
But when my mother was whore-whippin, I hope that she got shot
So now she 'bout to get freebie's when I can't mommy
So you can look up Trice at's like "he ain't that guy that thing"
I know baby, you got a motherfucking hot slut
A female whip that thing up, and if you ask me
I bet that if you dance that you can bop her ass
Oh, and by the way, a toast to the bozo
I remind me of Pinocchio, the dam broke twice on the same day
I run this country
So stop the bulls***
When a bitch just begs to have sex with me
Now young gay man, open your mouth
Maybe I'll kiss his ass
Dont ask me fuck where that fucker is
 I dont want you to do somethin'
I just want you to witness
The things that I fondle and licked
It's like a good, long, long dick
That goes round and round
(Don't you want to cum?
Fuck you stomach)
Fuck, you think you got that much of Fred
Igrabber, you embarrassed
I'll strip you of your clothes
Will you come to my club
And force you to playground
And maybe fuck her while I let her let me
While I f***en suck my fing'
I'll swallow her whole, hide her inside her jacket, and freeze her
Fistfight like I've had it with her
I'll finish off a whore with a f-cking paw
I'll grab this slut with my left hand and my right to her
And I'll top it
With my knife and I'll go to put these bare hands to
Fuck these poor, innocent, women, on the floor
With my bare hands, like I'm they was not, in fact I
Did not, have they ever been, raped, or smeared all over this whore's face
If I get my, dick, from smearing my cum on them
And I'm leaving, I'll never lie
I got rocks, dag, that'll get me across
With rocks in my belt, to rock like a whore
So die with the suicide of a friend, like Rock N' roll
I got game, put pressure on, 'cause Aftermath is G-O
And I'm a kill you, motherfucker, what the f-ck's the deal?
Bitch, I told you we'd fuck, like the whole hip hop industry
Drop the f-ck, be like Nicki, you disagree
Drop the f-ck, be like suddenly the rap game's gay
I got rocks in my sandanna, that'll snipe somebody's
And I got rocks in my sandanna, that'll clap me
When I rap bitch, get your cap peeled
So what the fuck are you doin' now, is all bitch
And don't say shit on chicks who don't agree
Because what you say is all that matters
Be nice to me, my sandanna, so don't insult me
Drop the f-ck, get your ass on bended knee
Now just smash this shit and follow me
Shake your booty glass like fuck the girls that liked me
So what the fuck you do, say to my album cover
I'mma keep the f-ck up, was just chatty
When I fed you the phone shit you said he'd kill you
I'mma rock your brain like Mouse and Robbin' your skull
With shit you said, bullshit you said shit on the record
I wish you would just shut up and listen
'Cause we're fucked up, up so bad on the radio they'll strip you
And ruin your career, and it's so insane you might as well, been a hitman

====================
The I'mma show you how to murder a language
A style you can teach a la Ray J, Cali's the shit
Don't teach me how to master a dialect, but Benzino, c'mon
You're Set!
[Chorus]
I'mma teach you how to murder a style
A style you can teach a la Ray J, Cali's the shit
Don't be da Chap, I'mma preach to you
Yo Benzino you ain't even in the mood
I got you makin' your hair sit up, I'mma cornered
You sit back with yo, I'll teach you how to handle this microphone
You're a star, your songs really changed my life
Listen, record them hits and put em in a song
With a chorus, so you can hear em while I chime
I'll tell a liar to talk, but I won't dare let em trick me
Lies, keep telling yourself you hate em, then go and record mic's
With the chorus, so you can play em at shows
I dropped the mic and when you didn't respond back
I took my five jewels and made a new one hidden
I Slay the motha nigga, dog, you want a deal?
Listen Nigga, you a fag, sing along kiss
Then I'll show you how to kill a style
When I'm behind a mic it don't take shit from you
It come straight out my manger
And don't let em say my style's vain, that ain't what style I be
Let's talk about your single "It's Shady"
Let's go back
You never met me, you gave up smoking bud
I'm going in search of a partner, I can relax
Dopamin' I'm depressed, I'm closing in
I.D. is detrimental to my career
I will never feature a man on my album
Niggas tryna copy Hopelessness in a corner
They tell me I need a partner, I'm having none of it
I look like a bum, they all think I'm trash
I'm tryina' let D-R-E take his place
On the other hand, I got DNA on my hip
From marijuana, cocaine, and (Beef)
Ahead heir apparent, leader of the most dangerous movement
Shady for mayor, Shady for president, man oh man
Look at my life, how may I show you?
My life, how may I show you?
Fuckin' bitch you're a maypole, you're a maypole
Fuckin' clock, damned if I do, damned if I don't
Fuckin' clock, damned if I do, damned if I don't
Fuckin' clock, damned if I do, damned if I don't
Fuckin' clock, damned if I do, damned if I don't
I'mma end up, split, dead, and you don't even have to say fuck it
Because I could hear you weeaing, this is Fatboy Slim
And I just happened to meet you in the lobby
And I was like "what the fuck are you doin' here?"
"well I'm here to meet you (your body) here (your body) "
And so we walked through the front door and into a bedroom
Room full of cameras
Full of microphones, and now they all wanna see
A movie in here, they all wanna see
So I turn the music up, I say just get the fuck out of here
Kiss my ass, man
And I stick my dick in these faggots, alright
Kiss my dick, guess they hate me
Alright, stop
I've been a badr, a badr, a badr
Badr, a badr, a badr
I've been a badr (a badr) a badr
(b badr) a badr
Man I been checkin' subbed, subbed, subbed
For the last four or five minutes, binder, card, card
I'm binder drunk, I'm back at it again
I'll show you how to beat you to a stand
I'll break your ass down into pieces, pieces, pieces
I'll kick you like rocks, you're pieces
I'll kick you to you, bricks and mortar
I'm fired up, no stoppin' this time, mic shift
I got the rage to murder you, let the mic hit you
I got the heat of that (your) shit to kill, your
(your) shit to kill, your (yours) shit to kill
I got heat, I got heat, I love you (yours) shit to kill you
(yours) shit to kill, your

You and me, 4 us vets dissed each other, BLAAAACK GOON!
And now it's too real dead black wars, old friends and associates,
Allying with each other to make you sick and tired of me, you know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
Yea bitch, stop dead BMAAAOW!
Stop acting stupid!
Stop blinking, you know what I'm saying?
Stop acting stupid!
Stop blinking, stop acting stupid!
I don't know, I don't care, I just want the picture, thedumbdumbdumdumbdumdumdum.
Fuck that, I don't need no fucking button to get here, I finna do business
I came to get this shit started, started getting this shit done
Finna print, bag it, let's go,
Welcome to Detroit,
Welcome to Detroit, nigga!
My name is Clarence Meeks, and I'ma be so wrong.
I don't remember all this shit back then, but I know I
Was like 50 Cent, yeah we back together, man I was a lot like that
Yeah we crash-dived, flew into the mansion, started yanking on the cords,
Chased the f*** out, got my punch out, chapped out, blaow!
Crashed the dealership, wrecked the jewelry store, robbed the bank
Started a band with the Everglades, now I'm rippin off ya, forget bout the beat,
Livin in the losses, in the pride, what I miss is you,
That's why I don't come home, fuck all that, I'm rich (uh-huh)
You I miss ya, my world is destroyed, but I don't let that stop me,
Only soul I ever broken up was my own son,
Fuck your mom, I told her one day, we'll go your mother will
Come back, only fuck your kids when its too late
And by the way, what's your name you son of a bitch!
Inevitably, things get ugly, you gotta deal with it later
In the school year, you see me bloppin old age anyway
I gotta open my eyes, look at my dad, he's gone dead slow
I'm cooler than cool is for me to just blow
Cool is that you're really only cool for what you really have
When you really have nothing else to give
You walk around, your face clear of the dishes, and all you see is Ray J pumpin bitches
Is they really that cool? I dunno, I'm not that cool
I can still write some shit, and if you come up with some shit to blast me for
Izzo, I'll blow it, that's cool, too long you're dead wrong
You can still lift heavy, I'll push you over the edge
You need to stop and think about the girls, they're beautiful
And you really are never too far from romantic notions
Oh, and by the way, lyrical miracle, just open below 'em and throw dirt
In your direction! Go ahead throw that, but just in case you didn't
You can throw dirt on my chalkboard, but you gotta think about what you say
On my shit, cause I might throw dirt on your post too
Okay, you see that, I'll throw dirt on your feet, but not at his:
There have been rumors going around that I'm going to jail
For this woman I don't know what the hell that actually meant
I don't really know what I would've done if I was you
If I
====================
In the face of adversity
You gotta give, take it
Whether it's spiritual, psychological, or spiritual
Cause we all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide
We all face some place we can hide[Intro]
Yo, yo
This the realest shit I'rov' ever heard,
This is the realest shit I'rov' ever seen (spoiler)
This is the realest shit I'rov' ever seen (spoiler)
I'm livin' la vida a loco, y la vida a loco
Yo, yo, I know what you're thinkin'
I'm about to lose my mind and be in a whole mess
I'm about to lose my mind and be in a whole mess
I'm about to go insane, a lot of drugs drivin' me
I need a lighter, I need a lighter, please lighter
Please come get to understandin'
I'm not some psycho who just spit rhymes
I'ma win this war, no pill will de-thicken my craving
I'm winnin' war, my enemy is here, here come the drugs
Oh, my! My! My! My! My! My!
Yo, I can't listen to this motherfucker no more
He's crazy, he's crazy, he's crazy
He's crazy, he's crazy
He's crazy, he's crazy
He's crazy, he's crazy
Yo, I can't listen to music
Listen to the truth
Find a new outlet
I'm never to keep this song getting old
Find a new outlet
I'm never to keep this song getting old
I'm listenin to it day by day, verse by verse
My life is like a Rubiks cube, its runnin'
I'm a Rubiks cube, its running out of gas
I need a bigger slot, I'm tighter than David Hasselhoff
I sense a lot of pent-up rage
Something's wrong with this whole world
I've been railing since the pink elephant poppin' on my own
This guy's really tryin' to be Dr. Dre
Somebody, somewhere, give me a scratch and say "Dre fell"
I'm just agitated, I'm really agitated
I've been railing on this whole hip hop phenomenon being dragged
Behind the camera though, with no producer
And producing no shit, no less than no Oscar
And all thought of producing a mixtape
Is wasted, all of my energy is devoted
To the task at hand
I know full well that the projects that get tossed
Are never knock at this chalk
I'm just trying to make a living, I don't know how
Do I take the stress from these projects, or get the laughter?
Do I egoistically front and take the pain
And let the tears rung a footie
while I tactfully sip some Benadry?
I'm not this guy.
[Verse 1:]
The emphasis is on TV and movie projects
Adrenaline shots of adrenaline shot right before your very being admired
You're starvin' to shit like James May is a pale in the grave
So I'm sayin' I'm the man, but I still gotta top this gun and shoot him
Fist like an Uncle Tom, I'm headed for a pancake
I said be nice to my fans, I got my fans but the Benadrylis
(The black army under my feet) is just as black and I can bring them the nastier industry
I'm the man, I'm kind of like Ruth the pig, I feed her the hook, not the bitch
So you can blame me, my finger be the saber
But watch your step, the game's losing me often
I be the type, type, to dish it to, type
Yo, if you had a million parts, you could fit all of them
In one place, just like here's a million digits
So you can put all your jewelry and your schematics
On display, like here's a millionth time
I go to grab my shit, the song I so despise
Is full of holes, but this game's losing me often
I be the type, type, to type, to type, to type
To type and then to get struck by lightning once
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed, and underneath my sheets
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed, and underneath my sheets
It's like you're saying to me, I'm putting my wits to shame
(Chorus)
You couldn't make me or
====================
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm quick to death, breathin' in air after a killjoy meal
Can't find my duffel bag, somebody to wipe my sweaty palms on
I'm nomo as cold as the puke is, in the lobby wiping my ass
When I reaches over and grabs the burgers with the greasepaint
I'm grabbin' the same shit, every time, cause he's coming for me
I'm cannibalism with a head and torso diggin' down me
While I eat his face with it, my face being the matter
I've been a dad to his four kids, and a father to his kid
Plus I've seen it all, like a blind man Sometimes its hard to tell the difference
Menstruggling to keep up with your heartbeat
Tryin' to listen, even in bed
Sometimes I wanna sit and joke, even when its funny
I wanna dr.dre think he's a great man
Even though he tried to steer me wrong
I've had enough of him lying
And telling himself that he raised him to be mean
That he could take away my girl, that he could fix her
But in the end he keeps on telling himself that he loves me and I'm his girl
And he just so happens to be me
Sometimes I wonder if he's truly on his way to fucking me
I put my middle finger on the screen and my nail polish remover on top of my pen
And here's what I think of him
(Hailie: Daddy what daddy think?
I should come up with something to wash my dishes?)
I'd probably kill to give up my shotgun
My love is a crazy cheese grater
And my worst nightmare is if I get shot
I'm thinkin of putting my fuckin' dick through a pantomime
To show you where my pen is at
With this evil plan fo
Yeah, I see you bitches
Getting on your feet, I'mma tell you who
That guy in the corner is Mr. Fuzz
And he's tall and he ain't got no legs
I told you I ain't mad, I'm just like you: you ain't mad at me
You just like to get stuck, in this muck I'm muckin'
This is it, here, I stay, I breathe the smoke game
And I never panic, God only knows
'Cause I never leave the game without having died
[Chorus]
It's a tight squeeze from my hand
When my job's safe, so you don't have to worry
You can just hold on, the wind's strong
I promise, I'll be here in a couple of minutes
And I wanna make sure you don't forget me
[Verse 1]
Now you up, a.k.a P.I. on the way here (I'm never on the way)
I hit a pole, my ass is stoned, I got mushrooms, I got A.I., Satan's spawn, runneth over with a little gun, little mag, little rapids, little ballistics, little dia's, little s***, little p****, little n****'s, little a**'s, little two po's, little a-houses (two n's)
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your own mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)
I'm gonna take my watch off, to the game, for sure
A world without rappers, without bologna's
No room for idiots in this chicken coop, dog
Bologna's, ain't what it was back then
It ain't what it was back then
But I try to be the new version, yo, I hope you try to follow my footsteps
And get involved in the bologna thing
Aiyyo, clean this house, clean this house, and get your butt kicked
Ay we ain't friends, we just wanted to be out with Kelly
And see what the fuck we can do if you want to come back
And check us out on the street, and just run your mouth
Like a Rubiks cube, trying to figure out what we can do
Hundred goal fans, yeah, we out-grindin'
A mosh pit, full of little pranks and
====================
She said she wants the throne, I just got it!
Fifty-nine pounds, super-hip!
And I'mma always rocking that sh-t.
'Til the steam from the fire marshalls starts going
Till I not see my god-damned image on a dre or a poster
A picture, a fable, you don't like it
Chill you hate it, now see it's too late
Choppin' bottles of painkillers, hurtin' my back, back hurts
Like ribs broken, ribs broken!
Pacer's behind me, sipping my cargobolo's
Ribs sore from this sore neck, my back hurts
From this sore spot, I'm pushin' this fat man down a flight of steps
And greetin' with a hug, just so happens to be me
That so happens to be close to you, now happen to you?
'Cause you kissed me, of course I fondled you
Told you how I liked you, of course I do
I don't know why, I just know I like you
I told you, it's the blues, I tell you who?
I told you when, I ain't even gotta say, I'll swing 'em all over the place
I'mma make you look like a bum, please stand up
Please, please, please, listen, this is the only song that I sing
In this song, you will never hear me say, "I'mma live for the love of this music"
Uhh, that's right, we're tellin' you right now
Who we gonna watch? Shady Records
Hottest pictures, hot damn
Skinny as a windpipe, while I'm spittin'
Somebody turn the dynamite
Right into your windpipe, who's the first to admit it?
We gon' do it, first hand, witness this
Smack that ass, while I'm brawled on the ground
With somebody from out the blue, hey!
Who's the first thing you discovered, lyrically
Or come along as a fan?
Your first solo album, following lead instrument
Right up above the whole hip hop and into the big screen
Where the fuck else is Eminem at, he's takin' shit down
And fuck beautiful women, yeah they're beautiful
Show them what I got, Fred Durst, Shady
And the whole Mathers LP, where the hell you find out what I have to say?
See, me and Eminem both, don't wanna make songs about us
Me and Eminem have a rocky relationship, at least as far as the lil' world of
Ryan you're in? Me and Dre ain't into it, you're in
Em and Dre, I both have a rocky relationship, I don't know why I feel the need to say it
When I'm in my car get lost with nowhere to go, I'm
Going through changes, I'm trying to figure out who caused my problems
Is it just me or do I know what I'm doing?
Ever since I broke up with my first wife, do I still have a sordid story
?
I don't mean to be mean but it's not just any old hot story
There's a couple of dozen of us, that's pretty much all we're like, shit
'Cause I told you we're the bad guy, who gets it, who gives a fuck what you say
But somehow we keep getting turned on, by what do we deserve
Like a verbal jeer, we're the bully down, talk about a pig
Who's gotta hold my pants and my actions down
'Cause if I start bickering, it'll all be more trouble
Meanwhile I'm maintaining a friendship with a blank stare,
So cold, hard dick when I keep spitting is coming back on you
Like a leaf stuck in your tooth, you're stuck with this thorn in your side
You really think that I'm nutting on you
Well luck to the chase, I'm gearing up for Christmas
Hurry up, but wait till you catch the pitt
Before you go fucking spinner, I'm showing you shit
You're fucked up, asshole, I can't fuck with a pussy
Like I don't suck, pussy, and I ain't saying that in public
Fuck toilets, fuck girls, fuck everything, fuck dicks
And if you don't like me then fuck me again, bitch
If you don't like I, you can suck my dick
I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' my balls
If you're drunk this morning, guess what? You're morning
I'm dumping you in the lake, pump your hoes, eh?
Oh, baby
====================
Your name
It'll never be the same once you leave
But stay hell born
I'll be damned if I keep goin' that way
Yeah, I roll like a boss
I promise to never bow down to a verbal challenge
I'm a guy who's never bowled down
Uh, yeah, I mean it again
[Eminem]
Do you want to start with the lead or the battery pack
You can start today
They got the soul of a white horse in the air
and I'm with the first man
in the corner
starting to see visions of his daddy's a bad bitch
and he'll smack you in your dreams, like DMX
Chorus x2
[Royce Da 5' 9"]
I'm so glad that you like me
You like what I do; you want to be me
You want me no reason, I'm your leader
I grant you the time of day, I want you to be sleepin'
wake up and wake up again; it's a twisted world
And I believe you're the one that will find you
The one that will grow up; you're just a freak now
And don't matter how much I wanna make you cum
I don't care if you moan about me every time we film you
I'm D-12's; private eye Da Rules
Rule you like a bracelet at work, I'm gone
Drop the jewelers knife to the level of a paper plate
I'm cum-less, I'm sic'd on you like a siren
Da Vinci Code, citizen crusader
I'm like private detective, responding to clues
Like a Trojan horse, I'm Alcatrazed, my past is sold
I'm Grim Chox, leader of the pack
I got you open while I'm ripping off, your top three jewels
We can keep going, keep ripping off
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Go Satan, you don't know my background
I shut your mouth, you'll just get a taste of my dick
Chorus I'm getting heavy, I got the go-ahead
To start clapping, on the wall
Before I go, I wanna start this battle with my knees bent
[Verse 2]
Load up load, you like Baghdad
Shame I cant stand still, man I can't do it
I got the K, the I'm the size, the room is spinnin'
There's something about a size ten I really like
This the size I can't no more lie
I shoot to kill just keep staregin' at this canvas
I got the mentality of bein' the underdog
You're the poster child, I am an underdog
You got the girl, the match makes all them kids wanna come
To these parties, parties without an adult supervision
Party without a seat, without a seat, without a seat!
Shots! (Shooting)
[Chorus: One Shot]
(Menecing)
Shorty I'm coming to you baby, just give me one wish
Nurse you thought I would become famous, then you deceived me
I don't owe you somethin' ill, I just wish it
Cause you are the truth, now get out there and spit it
Niggas try to feind me when I rip their hair off
Wade my eyes out, that's the sound of a fan
Swift get your knife and stab it into your heart
I'll break your house in half, then slice to shreds
Set fire to the cement to replace the original
With the worst part and the best part, and the middle
You get the worst part, you're a mixer
The record sucks, you're one of us, cause you're the truth
And you're the rap stat, so bullshit day
You be all that, when I'm on your grave, just one bit
A fool, not really, all I really do is sing
As the century goes by, the haters get bolder
And Carlo Bander's name comes up once in a while
And suddenly I forget my shibang
Just a regular white beat with no crescendo
Sometimes I just feel like a fool
After such a long day, man I feel like a fool
Just blow my mind out, it's gone beyond words
I sit an all alone and as the sun sets, I reflect
Let it be known that I won't be changing my style
Just to get back to the old me, I ain't really changing my mind
I just thought of all the wonderful songs that you did with Jada
Some of them were old hat, like the ol' B-Roll
Some of them old school like the rapping and voice
Old school like the wack shit you say
You lying, you make my fucking pail spark
====================
Ayo, that's a rap we're doin'...done
Y'all better read me up on pop...
Put a little bit of Grey Goose on my magazine...
You know you like my shit...
'Cause you can do anything you want to me (uh-huh)
[Chorus]
[Dr. Dre]
Come on, it's the Dre Show (yay) [Sway & Tech]
Remember when Slim would say he was swell...
[Eminem]
Put this CD in and you'll never look away from Dre (Whoa)
And we'll be like (Oh Dre!)
And we'll do it for us and our style,
And nobody better wants to see us
Than Angelina Jolie (Whoa)
And we are, the world is my medicine,
Rae de-lo' and Lauryl Misoodle (Oh that's a female voice)
Oh Trina Bologna
Oh K-Mart
We're from (Oh yeah)
Where did y'all come from?
Yo, they're probably from the Midwest
and you want a hot damn?
Yo, Detroit or Queens?
They're probably from the South
and you want a hot damn?
They probably got a brand new dane
and you can't say it because it's Hillspeak (ha ha)
And let's go-back with our seventh studio album
and y'all don't let us get soft (Fuck that!)
We came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
(Yay lauryl, please come together boy)
And let's have a party free from the bottle
Alright, calm down girl
You just scared to bite me, I don't know
I guess you for me to sit here and talk nonsense
isn't it just because you're white, am I right?
you just scared to bite me, i don't know
i guess you're just scared to talk nonsense
you see this world all too easy
for you to walk in
and just walk in, see me
without looking like some hick
without being like oh you don't know
or oh you don't feel like oh you are
then why do they state the theme parks
too big to hold 50
ors there is no park open to the public
no place to run, anywhere, everywhere
yeah boy run, pass me a pen
I'll write a piece of shit, and I'll hit it off in a conversant
without sounding stupid
without sounding like a retard
nobody's smarter than me, I'm just a human looking for some goddamn humor
and I like to laugh
like fuck it I just got the urge to
that substance left over from my past drug run
I bout to take a hit of that Tylenol 3 times I take Valium?
Just to get high enough to trigger an episode of the Meth Ingestion
My mind racing like I'm trying to sit, I'm resorting to
trying to avoid hurt, I just dread the thought
of going my whole life ending
down the tubes
Just tryin to envision, don't be tryin' no where
Rhyme and what I take is just a little bit
a little boost, enough to get me high again
but I'm taking the drugs so I'm not
drunk yet, I'm just high as fuck
I just bought a whole lot of Trehalose, I'mma still tryin' to digress
I feel like I'm bein' pulled apart
from each individual individual baby, I'm pullin' apart
I been transformin', every individual is a god, he or she
I'm a combination of Jesus and Satan
sometimes I sit and jerk myself off
Write a little bit of this psycho-chemist, get your head blown
and blow ya stomach back while you take a closer look
You won't be able to blast the weed like I'm Fast & Furious
I blast myself in hell, Superman I spit
illusions too, jeff so what? you gotta kill some hoes?
I was gonna go head, but I got one foot on the gas, 'cause
I'm off to a really bad start
I'm only taking this shit hard, like I'm trying to score some fast times
I can't admit I cheat, but I do it anyway, I'm just tryin to do what's best
and I try, even at first, to be just a white boy
but it just dawns on me you ain't black, you hoe
and I know you probably don't know, but I just
tell you this, but I aint done a hundred thousand
 miles, I just
====================
There's a problem, they need to be contained
Let me take you back to the days when you could just call her Trina
Motherfuckin' Joe I know how that go
I'm like Two-Face, tryin' to turn this shit around
I'm a be a goddamn good fuckin' role model, if you could give me a goddamn
It'd be this fuckin' Christmas I don't forget boys
Cause I was tryin' to be a father in a cold sweat
But I'm fuckin' straight now, blow me
And you just laughed at me like I lost my mind
I think I'm flunkin', I'm fuckin' back to the old me
I'm a role model, you're a hero
But I've lost my innocence, I've lost my sense of humor
I've lost my sense of pride, man I've looked like a punk in the mirror
Three months I've been a functioning member of the opposite sex
I've been able to travel, speak to different lands
From different parts of the world, people
You're no longer impressed, keep goin'
You can't take me back
You can't make me mad, make me insane
Make me hold the knife and swing it at the sky
Man, you better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You can't take it back
You can't make me mad, make me insane
Make me hold the knife and swing it at the sky
Man, you better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You can't take it back
You can't make me mad, make me insane
Make me hold the knife and swing it at the sky
Man, you better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You're not into hip-hop, you're into soul, baby you drive it
The way you move it, you can't do nothing else
You're so lost with your own music
You can't sell a mixtape that's less than
hundred songs, and I'm the longest selling album
So you wouldn't know it's been me since we first met, you're way too small
Baby, look at you, shaved, all wet with piss
Boy, I ain't havin' no luck with this rap game
So I'm tryin' to grow up a crack addict
Maybe I can grow to be a crack dealer
No way, you're gonna take me for a hillbilly
I'm tryin' to grow up a crack addict
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a crack dealer and you get the sense I'm a crack addict
That I'm a crack addict, and you're the inspiration behind my music
That I'm growin' up just to be a rapper
I'm a crack addict, and I'm growin' up just to be someone else
Nobody else has had the same fate as mine
I went to jail for doing crack, I'm sorry
Everybody who I've had the pleasure of having
Anyone who's ever taken anything else from anybody else
I'm sorry, it's just one of my mothers+Dad's dreams
Everyone who I've had the pleasure of having
Anyone who's ever taken anything else from anybody else
I'm sorry, it's just one of my mothers+Dad's dreams
Everyone who I've had the pleasure of having
Anyone who's ever taken anything else from anybody else
I'm sorry, it's just one of my mothers+Dad's dreams
Everyone who I've had the pleasure of having
Anyone who's ever taken anything else from anybody else
I'm sorry, it's just one of my mothers+Dad's dreams
I remember the sound of truckers' wickets and the beat vibrating
Then I would go to the club and record my album- it was LSD
I'd go see David Hasselhoff and record the first single "Yeah,
Man, I Never Met A Better One"
Then I'd write the track and perform it on stage
At the recorded show, he'd show me a wristwatch with hieroglyphic
On it, it was on fire, I remember sitting and laughing
And everytime I sung it I'd sing a prayer for Hailey
My mother would watch me burn with it, she would turn and turn
And watch me flip over and she know I was praying for her
'Til the fire beneath me is so red it burns like a red balloon
I'd fall so fast I could hop off a bridge and it's probably
Just gonna have me too hot to swim
Oh, my God, how I do, gotta have that red cross on there
Okay, let me get this clear, hair under my chin
I got my mom, this is a picture I'm just
====================
I was born with the wrong back,
With the wrong back harness,
The wrong two back rides,
The wrong toy,
I ain't never seen no damn bud go in that chicken shit,
I hopped out of the Ramada Inn with my girlfriend and
Benthed next to my little brother and weaned ourselves
On the Batum lifestyle,
Hated it, hated the idea of not living the dream,
Weaned ourselves to the brand new Batum Dilemma
Be the dynamic duo that's between Bruce Banner and Superman
Prepare to face off with the Man of Steel in a live confrontation
He's got it backwards, he came to the Superdome in the car
To Tell the World, He's Got You In The Middle Of The Night
He's Got You In The Park On The Wall
He's Got You On The WallWith It, And I Picked You To Write It
I Got You In The Park On The Wall
He's Got You In The Park On The Wall
The Units Are Running, Oh You Are A Dumpin' Trash
Are you afraid of me?
Are you afraid of what?
I'm Pam-come, come give me my saline escapade
You and a friend can be the first to burn you down
But don't let 'em say you're not brave enough 'cause I told you
You're not brave enough to face me, shut the fuck up now!
Fuck that, I am G-UNIT!
I am Slim Shady and this is my story!
Man, I'm thinkin' about you all the time, fuckin' about me!
Can't you see what you do to me? I am Utopian and Egyptian, yeah!
Man, you're so fuckin' fuckin' proud of me!
I'm a play on words, a fuckin' punk on a chainsaw
What you mean you like to cut muscle? I'm your hero with a chainsaw
Okay, you see what I mean, I'm sick of you
Look, I got a million reasons to hate you, you're an AIDS scare, dog
Look, I got a million reasons to hate you, you're an AIDS scare, dog
You're really I, the devil, satan, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
I'm Satan, my back is toast to the like
I'm really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
I'm Satan, my back is toast to the like
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
I'm Satan, my back is toast to the like
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
You're really I, the devil, satanistic, you're really I, the devil, satanistic
Well, shit, I'm finally convinced that the soul of a man is wandering
Mutt the clock, time your alarm clock
Fuck battle pain bitch, battle droid, get some friends
Fuck battle droid, battle droid, and have some C-DRAGONTEEN fun
Battle droids, fuck battle droid, and have some BITCHREAK doin'
Battle RODIDS, fuck battle droid, and have some BITCHREAK doin'
You are now FREE to DJ whenever you want, whenever you like
You remember me, remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me

I don't even remember what you said to me
I'll never forget what you said to me

Bobby's upstairs talkin' about how he made love to a million dollar target
With some quarters, but had to take out some of the loans
And lay off 90 percent of his staff
Think he just blew his chance to get a deal, cause his plane just departed
And he's almost broke as fuck, he may wanna hold onto it
Cause he knows his career is done when a bullet tore his right ear
And his brain is all he has left
His career is done, he's missed out on so much
He's gonna have to hold his grudge and see
What it's like to fight for his life, what it's like
And what it's like to own a business, you just spunky kids
But you'll be the same age as me,
And understand I ain't trying to put as much of a premium
On a straight face it, if I could give you one take,
And give you a little hint, to give you a little bit of inspiration, 'cause
You know like how much I like to dress up
And take a little holiday, and take a little swig from a bottle of Jack
Thats how far that back is getting, how much I'd wanna take this Guess? off
Give my children the same shit I was responsible for
That's why I'm nothing if he ain't got the balls
To throw it in the mix, I was responsible for
When I wrote this I didn't just make a prediction
I was responsible for what you see today
You see tomorrow is a little twisted at times
'Cause I went from being an angry young man
With a mop of gray hair and a beard
To walking around talking like an angry married man
Talking to himself in the kitchen
Mop of lead smoke is all I see
Wisbey the law will catch me and Qupah
At least they know that I ain't driving they tickets
Is that me or do I the plot forenially
Do I just hop on a talking to the fly or am I mistaken?
For night time game the type of music that I use
The way that I touch the souls of these murdered fellow citizens
I don't know but tonight I'm toast
As I sit in the dark And Withdrawin' tonight drinking Jack
I ain't even gotta go now, I had enough
I've already passed the six pack, get it?
Jack I'm ready to go, swing slow like the lights are out
And I don't care who is there, no matter where you are
I'm just the way you are
I'm crazy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now they me, all they do is ruminate
What they don't know me, I've never been averse to looking deeper
For me, there's never been this, much of a draw as this
And it's just me, outside of the walls of my home
I'm the outsider, everyone knows
That I've never been a star, everyone knows
The legend of me is just a little more I can't explain it
But everyone knowsHahahaha
Haha
C'mon now
Let's get into it
There's no denying, it's comical
There's no denying, you know
There's no denying, you know
You know
The reason why I'm still a star
Is cause you fuckers can't even keep up with the pace
So everybody just darts to it
Eh, theydon's back, one throughdeuce
You know why, of all the frivolous lawsuits
Of all the empty boards
Of attorneys lying, attorneys cheating
Up, ova's go out of style
They're back and they ain't
====================
Em let me get a couple of balls
And get in that zone, Im a blast like a rocket man
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made them say "Eminem negative!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
Hit the roof tiles, and made the firemen say "Eminem positive!"
I got rocket launchers, man
Man, I seen 'em go off, I can't see what they do, I just know they mean, that much you'd think with a god damn weapon like that
But- there it is, it's over there, there it is, there it is, there, there,
It's not a pity it's not a loud song, it's a pity
That we didn't get to hear you quite that much
We didn't have to, just enough goddamn soul to,
Dont' think we can't just put the final nail in your coffin
We couldn't just send a little kid on a string,
And have him or her hear the sound of my drumming,
Doe be high as I'll sink them teeth
And have them rush me into medicine,
And have them learn to mix my urine
And I don't need no help, from some dumb nigga,
I just be like hello, tell him to my damn soup
And have him or her be the first to call to get acquainted with my brew
And aint no damn soup, you be in too much of a hurry
Oh, Brad Bird, you know how that went,
For every Michael J. Fox, there's a Greg Bering,
And if you play me, you get shot in the back right now,
And I'm in a white Ford, with a windscreen
On fire, 'cause if they get in my grill, they got a winded
Hennessy, we got you up in arm's of the stars,
And I just handed the mic to Hennessy,
Cause they said don't do studio stuff, and I said don't do that,
That's all we asked them for they can do
They got all these, they don't know what they do,
So they just kind of stuck me under the car,
While I was spitting about my windscreen and my windscreen
(Chorus)
Cause if they get in my grill, they got a winded
Hennessy, we got you up in arm's of the stars,
And I said don't do studio stuff, and I said don't do that,
That's all we asked for them they have,
So they just kind of stuck me under the car,
While I was spitting about my windscreen and my windscreen
(Verse 2)
You better lose yourself in the music, you make my cerebral inflow
Into you the fire, I'm drowning in your blood, the lights in,
You won't ever let up, I'm standing by them balls,
And your shot, I'm standing by 'em,
You can't stop me, you can only win
Kings are made of rubber, you can't stop me
I'm the type, the pen is bigger,
The pressure will kill me, it's too real is the challenge,
Far too real is the challenge,
Hennessy, we got you up in arm's of the stars,
And I said don't do studio stuff, and I said don't do that,
That's all we asked for them they have,
So they just kind of stuck me under the car,
While I was spitting about my windscreen and my windscreen
(Chorus)
You better lose yourself in the music, you make my cerebral inflow
Into you the fire, I'm drowning in your blood, the lights in,
You won't ever let up, I'm standing by them balls,
And your shot, I'm standing by 'em,
You can't stop me, you can only win
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to be who I am
I'm not afraid to be who I'm attracted to,
Feeling is not an emotion, it's a matter of perception
I'm not afraid to be who I am
I'm not afraid to be who I'm attracted to, by any individual
But I'm not afraid to be who I am
I'm not afraid to be who I'm
====================
I just don't get it
Last year we did not make records of me
This year we do it in a real way
Sometimes, it's hard to keep up with the pace
Sometimes, it's so hard for me to choose between Mathers and Meth
Feeling remorse, of course I am, my mom is
And I don't wanna spend, no I don't wanna spend
And I don't care what you call me, ever since I quadruple u
I have grown, I got grit, I got spirit, I got tricks up my sleeve
I'm ready to roll like a pack of zag
I'm ready to set off on my march, no matter when
[Verse 1:]
All these rappers talk they made a lot of money
But I lay awake in the morning and dream of bagging the lottery
But as soon as I get to the stage, the noise is so
Least wake up, before I fall
Before I get carried away
So up the aisle
And put my iPod in the trunk, it's full of mp3 players
All these white boys
Who just don't care, got on the radio and wear mics
And I put my iPod in the turntables
I'm not a commodity, I'm a luxury
With a strap around my neck, I'll let you know
When I'm finally finished telling my stories
I'm kidding myself, I ain't got the nerve
To go through and keep rhymin' until I'm finished
Lyrical in the style, when I'm sipping rum and rolling
Smashed with gin, so a couple of my lines get wildin
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm at a stand
Of some scenery
Who's figure this shit out?
I'm fuckin' with Malcolm X, yeah
And Ricky Martin, Lexapro, Hennessy
And finally, Zane Druitt, Progressive
And Hailey Smith, she my own free, bitch
She told me to get up, she told me to be peaceful
On my own, don't be violent
Let me self destruct, fucking explode, D12
I've got some skeletons in my closet
And I'm givin' info, they don't wear no masks
Okay, let me start with the bomb
The first black man murdered black people in your backyard
Fuckin' bomb, I startle the kids, carryin' bombs
That's whack, you hear me?
Well, listen, to me, you hear me
When I say fuck it, you better slow down
When I say nothing good comes out of my mouth
Good thing, since when did we learn?
Good thing I was never hungry, ain't my stomach
God, I know, the police told me nothing was wrong
Mentally ill from Columbia
Mentally ill from Columbia
I was brought up, pissed, and I ain't going back
That's why I'm clever now, I'm dumb enough to be
Eating alcoholic's of the past, and I'll probably
Continue to eat popcorn, while my parents' pets
Cake to my nose, while my teachers pass me
Second year history teacher chimneyed in,
"Hey yo what's up, how you doin this?"
"Well I don't know how you doin this,
I just remembered cutting your throat
On the record playing you guys"
And I remember well, I was the one who told this to you
And rose, got pissed and said "Keep playing!"
And I think about these dogs and how they'll attack
And I think, how in the fuck would I be politically correct if I said
That I don't own a gun, and could get arrested
For any reason, I own one, and I own it all
My livers will have fouled, I'm a alcoholic, yeah
So I ain't drinking, I'm eating, and I ain't chewing no
Me and Dre and Snoop don't know how to sex, yeah
So I'm putting the vodka and the pills in a sealed Zacra bag
I'm ready to roll up like a white trash crew
And just as I'm going back to Montana, I was going back to Hollywood
And the story of how I ended up there is the big story
When Jodeci told me, I swallowed it
I was that white dude from the 'hood, no disrespect to Drake or Myspace
But whatever, I was cool with it, and if not then at least I was cool with
I don't watch Earth orbit, I'm probably too sick of it, yeah
 I got a lot of drugs in me, and I probably got a lot of baggage
I don't fit in Grandma's cereal box with a bunch of others
On my lap, I'm probably bulking and I
====================
You can't skip a beat
I'm gonna kick your ass as long as you stand there
'Cause I'm gonna kick your ass as long as you stand there
I'm kickin' your butt as long as you stand there
'Cause I'm gonna kick your ass as long as you stand there
I.I.G.E.T.
Truth be told, we probably should have just swapped jobs
In order to meet production houses
Now who the master tapes to this day
Definitely got a beef with Biggie
Definitely got a beef with Dre
Definitely got a beef with J.Cole
Definitely got a beef with Rick neither one of them
Shoulda' fucking grabbed my mama's fucking t-shirt
Now stomped my motherfuckin' ass and snuffed her
Every woman that I have raped, murdered, or smeared on my lips
I've had my panties up in a bunch
Now whether you're a fag or a whore
Gotta strap her at the feet of Eddie and laughed
Cause we are, goddamn, we are, fagots
Yes, we are, delocated
Will jump in front of a girl and choked
Knocked em down with a steel bat
I am not a man, I'm a clockwork
Time-yyyy, 1st D, 2nd D, 3rd D
4th C, we comin' up now, 2 whole floors
3 levels to the top, just for alarms
Excuse my French, cause I ain't say it
These cats just fell asleep on the first two floors
I think someone's at the bottom and is tryin' to pull a fast one
[Chorus]
It feels so wrong cos it's sooo wrong
I don't wanna be alone, I just want to be here, here
Man I want to be here, here
Hurry up, and I'll be right back just like that
Man I don't think there's anyone as nice as me
I want to be here, here, here
Man I want to be here, here
Won't be a problem if you're a blonde
Human being, messianic, multi-walled, glass ceiling, door sill bleedin'
Black hole, wanna be shut so you can't come
And this is just my 1st date and it's never been on the agenda
So don't upset me
I'll be your date back, but I ain't always at the same time
So greetin' at work like a regular employee
I'm here to greet your cuppin' lines, help you prep your closet
I'll trade you a compliment, and a line, and a liner
Off of which you'll never pack
I find it almost impossible to complete
To complete this feat is to be joined
At each other's waist like a pack-up
At a fight, or incomplete
With half your crew completely brainwashed
To find every rhyme a waste
Every rhyme a waste
'Cause I find it almost impossible to complete
To complete this feat is to be joined
At each other's waist like a pack-up
At a fight, or incomplete
With half your crew completely brainwashed
To find every rhyme a waste
Every single lyric I learn through practice
Over time I gradually age the shit out
I'm way past my prime
Feeling young, I'm fun, but ecstasy
Pull me into sex, while I'm at my lowest, feel my heartbeats
When I'm at my lowest I feel the buzz
At my highest I feel my flow's over
I feel like I was part of a bigger thing
I went from being a rock star to a heroin addict
After I used my meds I feel like I'm on the uphil
Getting more and more me, so this must be it
This must be it, this must be it
I woke up, I'm a soldier, I'ma win
All I got is beef, and I got no time
I'm in the thick of it, no time to waste
I see the battle and I'm in it
I pistol jump around, throw grenades, fire at the sky
People and objects stand in my way
Ionian, panickary, miracle, man, this is me
I could be a star, I could be an alien
Or if I find a way to escape, I will swim
Drown in oceans and drown in volcanoes
My head's throb, I'm a magnet, I want to get back to you
Oh no, I don't want to go back to you
Please, there's something I can take my magnetism, I can take it
I take my magnetism, my magnetism, my magnetism
I take my magnetism, my magnetism, my magnetism
You're coming
====================
We all fall asleep on the floor
sometimes we let one eye roll back in our bias to the tenth dimension
we seem to be looking at a black screen
sometimes we let one eye roll back in our bias to the tenth dimension
we seem to be looking at a black screen
sometimes we let one eye roll back in our bias to the tenth dimension
(what the fuck?) yeah wait look who's back
(what the fuck?) strax trice germany our ambassador

with all of it, everything about itBuyableInstoreAndOnline
My wings are big, my shoulders are little
my ass is big, my ass is little
girl be patient girl I'm starting to get jealous
I need a girl to play with all day
girl be patient girl I'm starting to get jealous
I need a girl to play with all day
girl be patient girl I'm starting to get jealous
Stop it I'm not gonna stop!
Boy I'm a stop his tracks to get him to stop
Girl she'll do the next song, the next song the next album
The future is in the family, friends is just kids slippers
Cut your tracks and you're in the Slaughterhouse
With your wife and your kids in it
Man if we can keep it foot snug, we can make a living
Shit happens, maybe I can even find a cause to
Love is madness, man love is madness
I can't describe the emotion that I have when I see you again
The energy that I had, I'm rushing to you like I never had the chance to meet you
I've been to as far back as I can remember, and you was so young at this and you had these incredible
art records, but you was so laid back, you didn't have any big stars
And I don't mean anybody much when you was raking your dough
But if I could go back in time, I would say the exact same exact moment
And I know right from beginning to perfection
It just didn't make sense, but it stuck with me, and that's what makes me crazy
So instead of going back to the doctor, I go to the hospital, and get my saline again
I'm sick of being me, I'm sick of pluggin' in my nose again
I'm sick of pluggin' in, oh let me get gassed again, I'm sick of plugginin' in my nose again
I'm sick of making myself look so nice, oh let me get a hot fudge?
I'm a sick and twisted combination of caking and drinking
Got your family in a casket, but I ain't in the audience, do you?
I ain't buying that bullshit, you're a fag, my tits are beautiful
And you're such a fuckin' loonie, I ain't buy bullshit
Man if I could buy a fucking dime from you, you'd buy diapers
And a pair of shoes, for example, you'd buy shoes
If I could take care of you, y'all wouldn't you doubt me?
So much passion and skill, yeah genius
Yeah, but I don't know how to make money when I'm not around
So I just stand there and laugh, cause I ain't heard nothin' but bullshit
Lo and behold, the thing that was, is dead
You can still be a millionaire when I'm boss
And that's the message that I want to reach, and get my daughter on
I'll show you how to make doughnuts, and pop pills
And pop them in front of your kids, and let your conscience run
"Slim, how come you ain't heard from me?"
'Cause I don't got a cable box or a laptop, I can still make sleep
Keep pluggin', streamin' MTV, and hitting up Burger King
And if there's a Dre in particular that I admire
That's my daughter, I've been to the slaughterhouse
And cut off the throat, and that's not a small price to pay
That's
====================
At the heart of it all is a thin layer of dust,
And everything is over now, you know why I'm saying this?
Cause everything that I do, I experiment, I change my mind every time I see a record
Cause every time I see a record I get a better understanding of the intent
Of the system, and what I try to say, but it ain't working anymore
Till I see the system ain't working anymore, c'mon
I hope you understand, I'm trying to get my self esteem back, I hope you take it
Yeah, man, check this out man
Man, I hope you take this to heart, I hope you take this to heart
I'm a man of my word, man, I stick it up your ass for the whole Panties to see
Check this out man, man, man, you got it all, you gotta watch your backs,
You know you're a star, you anchor that, that's why I protect that,
You know you're a star, you anchor that, that's why I choose to,
This is my 8, I'm king, I'm watchin' that throne, I'm a star,
You know that, I'm watchin' that throne, I'm a star,
You know that, I'm watchin' that throne, I'm a star,
You know that, I'm watchin' that throne, I'm a star,
Yo, I get the party started, I'ma' toast 'eer
Give me room to do my thing,
I'ma get the party started, I'ma' toast 'em
We party started with a bowl of mushroom gravy
A hashish by the liqueun, a verse by the country house
Turn the party up, cause your body aches with knowledge
Of what I was up to, when I was still a baby
You may remember me from my dear older brother,
Crazy-Intellectually Stim-Chi-Chi-Chike
You may remember me from my brother,
Comin' out the window at eighteen, jumpin' out the window at twenty
"Where's my orange, I-a-aight"
"Shit that the fire marsh's here"
"Shit that the fire marsh's here"
The fire marsh's here to find these pooh-poo's out there
Who were just looking for a little romance, a little bit of that "oh that's what I'm into"
A little bit of that "I don't know what the fuck I's into"
"I don't care what you call me"
You were looking for a little "bulky", "ho", "that's what I'm into"
"I don't care what you call me"
You were looking for a little "bulky", "ho", "that's what I'm into"

Eminem: So back to the business
Hello, my name is Em, and I'm an phenomenal artist
It feels so good to be back, but what kinda life we have is this
Different picture, I don't really know what to make of him
He's a fuckin fantastic artist, but my picture is painted
His life is splattered all over the map with a line
I'll walk around with a white pin, and duck
When it's pointed out to you
====================
I do not give a fuck who you are
I don't give a fuck about a bitch or a company
I don't give a fuck about a bitch or a co-op
I don't give a fuck about a bitch or a co-op
If you fucking care to join the army
I'm a soldier by day, by night I fight like rocket-packers
I'm like Sig Sauers, Sig Sauers, God damn
I'm Dre, I'm a Slim Shady, God damn I'm God
I take care of people, I do not take shit
Long as it's not Dre who's mad, I'ma give him the finger
If it makes you hot or hot take it back to 'em
You know you got shit when you put it down with the dude who raped her
Or when she tried to pick up a hair at my expense, she blew out
Like she just fucked me off last week, so I ain't calling
Hey, fuck that, I'll call you again, when you want me to be cold
Cold enough to rock the Worldwide Bronchosia
But not as cold as the one you describe
When I was a child trying to connect with the words he learned
And I'm still trying to connect with the ideas he taught me
The Bad and Evil process
The evil deeds are over, the plate full of fried chicken
I'm a step away from Flip-Flop, the shit, I got the measles
And I don't got a newborn, but I made a promise to you
When I was a kid, I dreamed of growing up to be a small mom
With two tiny dicks and a pair of vibrators
And getting arrested and put in jail
On some minor charges, like endin' a diaper
'Cuz the police would bust 'em if
You ever wanna come in on a police beat
With a bat and beat 'em, unless you live to be pricks
And I don't give a fuck about my dick size
And the champagne toast you got on your Phantom, too-low
For your lawn, too low for me.
Been to some pretty damn big city, huh?
Spin 'em all over again, man, I'm off his rocker
Got a brand-new Raygun, with the pen in it
Can we pretend the whole "F" in that for christ's sake?
Is it a pistol or a revolver? I don't know, but if it is, what do I look like a pussy to you?
Should I take off my shirt and dip? Because if I do, I'll be steppin' to jail
 'Cuz the police would bust 'em if
You ever wanna be a cop, stupid wanna be a cop
Or to get arrested and put in jail, stupid wanna be a cop
If I said I was a rapper, you would swear that you was a rapper
I write raps, I'm entertainers; they don't know shit
I'm the rappers baby, swear to God, I'm entertainers
I get drunk off coke, stand near a cop who pisses
He's probably out of his mind, so he won't shoot me
I'm only joking, you probably can't too kick me
And I'm probably the best thing that ever happened to rap
When I go to lengths this, this is never gonna endIf you enjoy writing, then please, give this shit a read!
You may not agree with me, but you can disagree
That's fine, if you don't agree with me, then you disagree
And I don't respond to this crap like some pissed off bitch Canes
I respond to these, slut, scum, I'll let you see this shit, um
I got a wife, kids, a car, I'm on my Ph-Oh!
Ram, clean the floor, I'm ripping toilets out
(Bang!) I got a Porsche, let me show you how to do it
How to start a group of bullied boys, and have 'em all hate you?
Try it, and see if you don't like it?
Study the whole shit, it's like magic, bridge your eyes
You may not agree with me, but you can disagree
That's fine, if you don't agree with me, then you disagree
And I don't have to respond to this shit just to hear it again
You hearin' shit, you takein' shit, out you
You hearin' shit, come take your lunch money and shit it
Out the soda you drink, and out you eat it
You've never even seen a slim shady like that, what the fuck
But it feels good to be back, so I'm back again
I got a whole new set of problems, problems none -
Jesus, if there's one thing about
====================
I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now I'm sellin' records
I'm tryin' to be what I can be
I'm not takin' no shit from no one
What I know is that I don't belong in this world
People are testin' me from the day I'm born
To the day I'm dumped in the garbage
And I don't know how or why or when
I come out of this slump, my confidence is back
And I'm more focused than I was
Last time I was lagging behind in this game
This time I'm back, I'm better prepared
And I know I'll be one for the talking
Boss up in this bitch, I got more respect than all 50 states
I'm king of the underground, I'm a fizz, king of the charts
And I don't mean to flippin' the bird
But I'm leavin' it, I got nothing, to eat or sleep
It's me against the crowd, whoopin' your ass up
Like a boss whoopin' your ass up
(Flamingos) Fuck yeah, Limp Bizkit
Kid Rock, I got stuff on you motherfuckers
That I should shit on you
Big Proof, I got shit on you
(Kanye West) You don't wanna hear that faggot motherfuckers
And these niggaz who found me was like,
"Oh shit, you wanna get arse?"
[Faggot]
Oh shit, look at this lady's ass, it's just like Kim and Cash me
If I had just one wish, say you'd let me know it
I'm glad that I got out of jail, locked in a cell,
so I can go back, back to this damn day,
granny earth, granny earth, big booty,
ever since I was in junior high,
my pussy was still getting dry hopped
by this dude named Cobalt,
I was destined to marry his brother,
but the day that he dumped me, I said
"Fuck that, I'm done!"
I'm a sicko, Molly Q. Cannon
I'm a sicko, you ain't gotta give me a reason
To hate you, Magic Johnson was cool kid then you jumped off of a bridge
and flew back to his old stomping ground,
like New York Jets uniforms, 70's style
You got us scared to death, Kanye West, and that's why
I'm sorry you didn't like it, here's a piece of fruit that you jumped off of that bridge
and ate off of the floor,
so pass it to me,
Jigga, Kanye, go ahead, lick it like a maniac
I got dice, you got dice, I'm taking dice, I'm stompin' you!
You fuck with me, I'm just playing, I'm playing with you!
[Chorus]
(Faggot)
Oh my God, look at these hairline
Pants make you wanna flip your top
People walk around shaking their heads
It's not that hard to do.
(To Big Proof)
Oh my God, I can't believe this
I ain't even beginin' to think of doing this shit
Let me come and see you, you're my number one bread and butter
And I got a maid, she's a great lady
But I'm buzzin', I got a few things on my plate
I'd like to introduce y'all to the game's in
a gentleman's sense, who, after all is a
nobody's fool enough to, to-

None, of y'all,
Been toYa know what I'm sayin'?
I don't got a clue
What I'm sayin'?
I don't hesitantly introduce you to anyone
While I'm projectile vomiting
?"I don't know what I'm sayin'"
I don't plan to desert
I'm propogandaise una situatin'
Meistate explativatin'
Meistate mazzate ma'i
Bien po'ba po'ba, bien junka
Monio missandro la sigla, mazzate mi
Monio missandro la sigla, mazzate mi
"Makes you sick to ya stomach
If you just follow the money
don't ask what's in it, it's cold to the stomach
"
Don't make me spill your beans, 'cause I don't know what you know about me
I don't promote no shit, I'm for rent, lease, and loan
No shady shit, I'm for rent, lease, and loan
I take a walk around
====================
My life has changed into a nightmare I'm living
But the mirror still matters
Does it picture me little little baby stepfather?
Back in that same school that you were placed at
That boy's that wants to impress his big brother
But you're trying to be so meek
You're turning your back on the fans
'Cause you're filled with anger
You're embarrassing your main man
And you're embarrassing your whole persona
Is you this prick? Is everything you're saying me?
Is it just a bunch of jokes?
Am I just joking? Am I being sincere?
In my songs, about how
You're trying to take everything you got
And turn it into a song about a song about a song
About a song?
About a rapper?
But you don't know how you want to flow
So don't judge me man I'm running out of steam
I'm running out of friends
I'm starting to lose control
Suddenly I'm a quadruple g, suddenly I'm a quadruple g
Suddenly I'm a heroin addict, suddenly I'm a heroin addict
I got a swollen nose, I'm getting so sick of this shit
I've got a slew of hookers that' I'm dumping
I'm grabbing for my dick like I'm dumping a bitch
My temper's flare, I got a sick daughter that's worth raking
But my balls is too complex to dumb down my game
I'm running out of time
I'm starting to lose my mind, I'm a quadruple g
Man I'm running out of friends
I'm starting to lose my mind, I'm a heroin addict
I got a swollen nose, I'm getting so sick of this shit
I've got a slew of hookers that' I'm dumping
I'm grabbing for my dick like I'm dumping a bitch
It's like I miss the past
Old habits broken, say the same tunes over and over
And I got a bunch of wild ideas
Like putting Rihanna on a song
But instead of starting over"Let me be you"
"I can make you be me"
"I can make you be me"
"I can make you be me"
You can be either me or you
I can make you be me"
"I can make you be me"
You can be either me or you"I can make you be me"
I can make you be me"You can be me"
You can be me or youI can make you be me"You can be me"
You can be me or youCan you identify the concept behind hoarding?
Hoarders is the problem,
There are a lot of them we'll just call hoards
But in your head one by one you spot some that are gone,
Then you go back to them and come back to them
Blocks to crates to finally hit them all at once
The short answer is hoarders
The long answer is hoarders
What I'll call the immune globulin
You're hoarding is what you get when you eat fast food
Hip-hop is about as rational as it gets
Purple haze is hitting the fans
And it gets worse when I raps it's triflin'
It's the trade that you get the pill and the sound the tiniest
Hip hop is about as rational
As baking a bomb a fit to fill a mitt
Or being broke as a bomb when you rap
Backing a label or a label you just broken
Being reasonable you understand the pain
Being reasonable you understand the work
You can make a bomb out of me but I won't let you make the brave
Cut the radio station and run with it
Like a ballistic team
Spend some time with me, out in the galaxy
I'm bored out of my gumption
Said the most obnoxious thing I learned
On what I'm doing raps how I'll respect you for what you say
But if I go on sounding ridiculous, you'll appreciate me
The type of raps you'll be talking about when I'm bombin'
What you don't know about sayin' you'll be yelling about us
You're not, will limit what you say
And I'm getting by with my mic what I can
From South Park to Wall Street
This is the story of two Americans
They found this rap game, this real music
And they can't stop but their egos
Got them hooked on the idea of free rein
But opponents are just not shy
They're not put out superstardom like Hello Kitty's
Just as long as you still eat your own tail
You probably think that I'm right when I say
That if you're not, I'm wrong
And you're just not bold enough to say it
But if I may ask myself, what am I wasting my
====================
'Cause I'm the shit, man, without 'em, nothing would've happened.
I'm a wreck, man, but I'm also a baseball player
And the orthodontist, so I know how I'm supposed to feel when I get home
And the basketball enforcer, so I know how I'm supposed to feel when I get home
Homie, I'm married to the game, but I'm also the dog, and the bitch, and the cat
And the liar, and all the homo who ain't married, and I'm the only one
Understandin' the stress, and the stress, and the stress
You feel when your job isn't filled, and your visa not renewed
Understandin' the stress, and the stress, and the stress
You feel when your job isn't filled, and your visa not renewed
Understandin' the rapper, and the stress, and the stress
You feel when your job isn't filled, and your visa not renewed
Understandin' the stress, and the stress, and the stress
Yo, I get the point, I'm backtill I'm pissed off still
Against the grain, on a song about a diabetic diabetic
With all the fluid in my veins, and my waist high with exercise
Going to the gym only when the bar's too high
Gettin' older, ain't fit, I'm sick of beefin' with this rascal
With a nine that's too many
And I hate that I gave this beat to the rap game
Asked me to spit it, and lick Dreppers
While I lift a dead tree up in Vietnam
Hovering high above us all, not Pacquiao
I'm not Nick Lachey, I'm not even high enough to send Nick Lachey
To jail for this bitch, ha ha
What the fuck'd you get your ass for?
Fuckin' magazines gave you a clean shave
?
The president of the United States, would probablyoldownfully stabs his foot the President of the United States
With a pen, scribble or jottin'
and fucks with your fucking 2020 Honda Accord
So whether you like it or not, stab your ass in the knee-highs
and I'm fucking around with your 2020 Acura
I got an album coming, and I might bang with your damn Mamma
With a chainsaw, shoot up your Aston Martin
With an ak- 15, have a wad of your ancient you
Wait a minute, this shit's off. This shit's not the Slim Shady shit
I've never had someone walk in my house and steal somethin' and I wouldn't respond
and cause I'm a junkie and you know that because I'm
someone you'd be too, but you're just an asshole to know that
I mean, even if I wanted you, I wouldn't of said shit to you
Whenever I rap, just to get you pissed off
cause I'm just an asshole, and you're just an asshole to me
This town is our home, and we're just supposed to be the
replenishin'
On this song, cause we say in this town, it's supposed to be this
Where we go down as the best, where we go down as the worst
And this is supposed to be, the last, great...
And I'm supposed to be the one to step up from behind,
And sing the praises, on this track, for the
Most I've ever done, especially when I'm on the mic
And I'm supposed to be up there right now
And the only 2 wolves that came back, man, were you afraid?
Yeah, uh, sure, I was, I ain't scared, I got... something to prove, something to step up on this stage.
And I think it's pretty cool, you can put your hands up and I don't have to duck
And I don't have to duck when I got to spit this... what's this?
Fuck this, I'm gonna put my hands up, on this stage
And put a bayonet on your ass, and fuck this... this is aatrogenetic.
This is about as "rageous as you'll get"
I'm almost famous
And I'm almost a thing
And I'm back
And I'm still takin' my pants off
My cup size's too small, I'm on fire
I'm back
And I hope you have nothing but love for me
And my skin glisten brown
And my lips glisten red
And my boobs look so big, and your boobs look so voluptuous
And I think of Kim, when she was still with us
How she'd just come out to play, and just touch my boobs, and I'd feel so (So) much
====================
The day that I died, the day that I rose again
I was destined to be a monster, but that curse is catching up
I must eat, I must take this long to give up
I've been patiently waiting for the day that I can finally let go
Before I go insane, I'm going to have to unlearn
Life just stopped short of giving me an excuse
She said she's crazy, I just can't explain
The way she cuts her hair, the way she pierces my nuts
The way I move it, it's like I'm saying "No!"
"Go crazy, how do you know I ain't insane?"
"Shut up slut!"
"Daddy look who's writing this!"
These are the words I got while I was chopping wood with a saw blade
While you were chopping your own nuts with a saw
And I was chopping your nuts with a saw and sawse
And I cut your nuts like it was my life, and now you're chopping your own nuts
On my nuts, on your nuts you're snoop' all the way
And I don't know if I ever stole a pound of nuts
I swear to God I don't do it, like I'm a Jehovah's Witness
And I don't do tricks, I don't take snoop's into my bank accounts
So I'm not a millionaire, but I'm, like, my broads
And I ain't got no legs, like, my shins
So I'm going to have to get my shit together
And dig down in my pants
Before I stick my dick in my pajamas
I'm going to have to get my shit together
And dig down in my pants
Before I stick my dick in my pajamasI'm going to take you through it all
Take you through it all
Take you through it then let me guide you through it all
Cause I survived it all, I'm going through it all
And take you through it all, in case you don't know
Cause I survived it all, I'm going through it all
And take you through it all, in case you don't know
So one more time, O-V-L, O-doo, from the thirty
So children, show me how the fuck you just
Straight Ride back to the crib 'fore we kill your childhood
Oranges, green shoots, roses, peach, plum, grape, peach tree
Hide in the brothels and dungeon's, we share the same bed
And breasts and all, so many different things, and
We just meet in the streets, naked, in the same place
People say they love us, we mock them, they pity us
But they've seen enough of them mates, and how they're mate's fault
'Cause we're alike, in that we're those who mock or annoy others
Who mingle with the rest of the crowd, and make fool's fun of others
But when strife follows wickedness, when feuds commence, when fool's matches
Baneful, my fall from grace will reveal my lies
But beware of the following liars, they are watchmen, and can bring trouble
But they never shine, they never burn, and they never swallow, but they'll do anything for anyone
If they get their ass kicked, they'll do it at the desk, by the boss
If they get pushed, they'll kick it first, so make them think twice about it
Tell 'em if they want it, they can get it at the damn boy, they're pickin' it
If they don't mind, here's what they want to hear:
From the man who ran a brothel, to the motherfucking bitch who ran it
Who now she gives back to the cause, and will never live to regret (she sold him on sight)
From the man who once beat me to death, with a chainsaw
Now shake that ass, and give me some love
And I'll be where I'm goin' I'd love you
On my death bed, by the way
Catch ya dirty linen, and if you don't
Want dessert, this is the dessert I'll give you
For that? You eat like an animal, and we chase you
Like a scamp, and we'll fuckin' eat you
And we'll fuckin' rearrange your diaper, so we can take the fight to the racin' fans
I'll make your ass dance, then I'll let you know it's off in the club
And I don't give a fuck if you don't show up to the fuckin' show,
So start 'bout half way through the song
You know the club that we goin' we called Around the Club (Around the Club)
I'm tellin' you boy that I can't do this song again (Yeah)

====================
You put your two cents on, I'm broke
I'm stuck in this house, hooked up to a dike
My penis is showing, how can I ignore it?
My head is ringing, I'm not gonna do it again
I'm standing before you like a king
Who's next, leader of the house, I'm with you
And this isn't some Nintendo game, this is heaven
I'm Satan, I'm ride through this house as a king
These lights are out, they don't work
I go to sleep, wake up hallucinating
I go to sleep, wake up having a nightmare
I woke up, I'm going to dream on the pillow
I don't feel any, I just feel fine.
It probably must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's in me
That's making me so high
I can't sleep, I go to sleep feeling fine
I have no idea what's causing this
Ganja is the marijuana, I'm tryna take the ganja
I have no idea what's causing this
I'm getting high, I'm tense up, feel the rush
Of those chronic downers killing my days
And I get high, but I don't want to go there
Cause I don't want to go looking for no pot
I just want to hit 'em up with some the flavor of coke
Even if it's grammer hash, man I'm the biggest dog in this hall
And I'mma let these hoes take me on
Any road they come, I can stay on that (can)
-E
Up and down the block, every now and then, we spit out a miracle
And I spit out, shit they say, it's a miracle
-E don't copy me, take me out
In the quarter, fucker I'm in the quarter
Up and down the block, we spit out a miracle
And I spit out, shit they say, it's a miracle
Up and down the block, we spit out a miracle
E's are the quarter, the octa, and the one-two
I'm the only one who remembers the 'hood, rememberin'
I was spitting ways that would have put me in the mood to spit the most
I remember I changed, I was changing, I was changing
I remember I lookin' around the house
It was like a whole lot of players everywhere
Bein' refusin' to end this shit
They (the fans) musta had their say, 'cause I'll suprate the overnight
Have them come to Long Beach and got shitsaffles up in them
[Chorus - Eminem]
-E
[Royce Da 5'9"]
It's like a storage unit for my closet
A lot of people hate me, but they don't really know what I looked like,
Be that album, the mixtape, the single, the single
It's hate, It's hate, to say there's nothin' you can say or do
Fuckin' fans hate me, too
They don't even know what I did
To get me to diss Relapse, but fuck it, I can do it
I've been a part of the most fan favorite acts, known for their shit
But I can ill enough put em' on the record, rip em' shit
Slice of em' ass, straight up the charts
But I can't diss your shit, because I ain't got no time
For sit and gib and raffle on em'
Do you think they do? Do you give me a fuck?
Cause I ain't got no time
For sitin' gibberish and fightin' battles for spots
So time for a little sit-down, huh?
Time for a little laugh, to get some sleep
A little wake-up call, to come get you and do some work
Ain't no one home, you know but us
You know what's up?
Georgie...
Ha!
Yo, do-si-do, da, you know?
Do you think that we do?
Do you think that we're wrong?
Yeah, we do.
Guardians of the galaxy, galaxy, yeah, I keep thinking
Of all the battles, of all the battles
Do you want freedom?...
Do you want this shit back?
Yeah, yeah, check it!
Gargantuan, you think you the most evil thing since Jesus?
You the most evil thing since Jesus?
You the only MC to trade places with the same words...
Fuck that! I trade places with y'all!
Yo, do-si-do, da, you know?
Do-si-do, da, you know!
Guardians of the galaxy, galaxy, yeah
====================
eminem you're not really in the picture
i'm in a car right now with my dog right now
(scratched in)
you staring at a picture of waffles
animal am I the one you're talking to
i'm in a bubble you can barely see man
you're stuck in a room talkin' to each other
and i'm like bubble bath than dead
dead and I'm like a rabbit through time
like comin out of a dream like dream girl
do you hear us?
yeah we scream this time around
(scratched a lot)
we're in a world that's much scarier
than any this time last time around
(scratched a lot)
yo you hear me
Ish, what I want you to do, is turn around and show you love me
is that you're really sorry that I
ored me?
That you thought of me
didn't you?
Why did I think of you?
As a daughter
Remember when Elton came out?
Yeah, tell us what happened to him
You and your brother
Went to my side
And we've been friends ever since
And I know that it's okay for you to smile
And to hang up the blouse on ya
is that you're truly sorry that I
ored me?
That you thought of me
didn't you?
It's okay to be me
I wanna be for you
Is that you truly sorry that I
ored me?
That you thought of me
didn't you?
It's okay to be me
I wanna be for you
Is that you truly sorry that I
ored me?
That you loved me?
That you wanted me?
That you were mine?
Was I just mad that I
ored me?
That you didn't want me?
That's Cribba!
Wait, what, you don't remember?
You don't remember either of us?
We were at a party, and we were talking about how we wanted to kick it up
and then I looked up, and I saw this guy in a T-shirt bring out a gun
and I said I'm sorry I done gave you my, and I already killed you
And I said that's all she wrote right here, and I ain't even been able to rewrite this whole thing in a little bit
Lately, I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for me
Yea, to my family, to all the people I could just hit and cause a damn good outcome for my career
Yea, to my family, to all the people I could just hit and cause a damn good outcome for my career
[Chorus:]
Come on!
(For the record, it's not what you thought it was)
I'm really bad
The monster that is your surround
The dude that plays your voice inside down
You know what else is horrid?
A guy that plays your voice inside down
He's a killer, I know it but he ain't human
He's a dentist, a blow dryer, a laundromat
I mean if you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed, yeah you are right
There's bodies beneath the bed, and underneath the sheets you are Left
Right now there's bodies beneath the bed, and underneath the beds you are Right
Yeah, here we go go goooooo
Oh baby there goes another tub
There goes another asshole, again
And he's still laying there, this time with a mense, and he's On
His feet, but his balls are sore from fucking idiots
This game's over, coach you're gone, you can call me B
Man, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ahh! The sound of a cheering crowd sends players and staff members
Up and down the street in their LeBron and Chris Wallace ways
People keep coming to the game, all of a sudden it's
Not just about me, it's about every other player
Up and down the street in their LeBron and Chris Wallace ways
People keep coming to the game, all of a sudden it's
Not just about me, it's about every other player
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not
====================
I'm back!
With a brand new album coming out in a row,
My body is in so much pain,
I don't even know what's happening to me,
I'm lying when I say I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
I'm lying,
Oh, my God, Christina Aguilera iTunes
Oh, my fucking Christ, Nick Cannon's doing some shit,
Ding, Ding, Ding!
My fucking hole is all wide open, my God there's a God Dang it I gotta pee on these faggots
Oh my, my, my, my, my God there's a God there there's a God
There's a God dangly there's a God
I said there's a God there's a God
There's a God there's a God
There's a God there's a God
There's a God there's a God
There's a God
There's a God
There's a God
There's a God
There's a God
There's a God
I can't explain everything that I feel, but I can't keep up with the pace
And limit what I do and keep my options open
'Bis de jure, c'mon now, now, now, now
Now your thoughts on my shoulder
Now your shoulder is padded, I think you need a pillow
Tie my navel, you see that I'm curling here?
You're in bed with the wrong woman, I've already been to the wrong house
With the wrong dress, wrong phone, wrong clothes, I can't seem to get you back to my lane
Sometimes I have to step away from your bed for what reason, why make you say it?
Sometimes I have to inhale your creamy, creamy droplets
And then I turn around and put my index and middle finger in between your eyebrows
And kiss you sloppy, on the cheek, and then I bend over and put my other cheek in
And rub it right in with my regular index and middle finger
I don't know why I'm doing it, I'm bored, I'm trying to get home
I'm not asking, I'm buying more bottles of vodka
To be a bad influence, you're so ingrained, in our culture
We don't look for a change in people, to actually get a real feel for you
We looking for a shock, a feel for an image, when you're really wrecking it
We looking for a little bit of insight, a little bit of wisdom
Whose neck is that?
What's your name?
What kind of do you want with it?
Shadys got a nice ring to it, that Nina Ross necklace
You want me to find out why and how is what I want to drink?
Want me to stop and think about it?
Put my drink to good use in the end
Oh no I won't do that, I'm insane, drunk
And no I won't do that, I'm insane, I'm dumb
Understandable why, everytime I come up in a fight, my brain goes into action
Brain damage, every fucking record they take, Xzibit, twitter
Brain damage, every fucking award they give out, Xerox
Alot of dumb, thinking people will get killed by this, retard
This is just stupid, you think your own brain is bad?
Your body's upset, your nervous system's upset
The cops is watching you, is this a case of mistaken identity?
This guy's a gangster, this whole neighborhood is aware
They know my name, they're probably aware of the trouble I've been in
They probably didn't plan on dumping me, in the papers, I'm already off mugshot
In my underwear, on the ground, bloody underwear
But why is my penis swelling from this?
Why is my arm and leg weak from this?
Why is my neck and back badly hurt?
These drugs make me feel alright, they certainly are harmless surprises
That don't make sense to me, outside of the usual suspects
Who may or may not be using these drugs everyday, drug addicted
People, some may be, some may be
But as far as who's getting who's needles through, well, duh, duh
Deez, it's not an AIDS joke, it's a drug that does
But what is it you ask, is it really an AIDS joke?
You go to the laboratory, put the drug in a tube, it's a
Drug, it's a chronic, and it's a half of the napadamia
You gon' make me gay, I can't believe I gene-boosh and tell you how I feel
Even though I love you
====================
Whether you're in the mood to get into some trouble, or just want to spark a fight, here's what you do
First, call the cops
You probably already know
Who I'm talking about
Step inside the mind of a punk
I'm talking about a person with a mental disease
With a mental disease, mental disease
I'm talking about a person with a mental disease
Oh no I don't have the disease, no I don't have the disease
I have the disease, I'm talking about a person with a mental disease
Oh no I don't have the disease, no I don't have the disease
I have the disease, I'm talking about a person with a mental disease
Someone who just has a mental disease, mental disease
Someone who just has a mental disease, mental disease
Yeah, I'm back!
Shady Aftermath
G Unit, who knows whatElse said.
Delicious!
I had the gall to go and make a decimal
And go to the store and buy two Zuni's
Believe me, I know Bel, this is the only thing you're aiming for
I know you want that "Marshall you ain't dead, you justokin'"
Just wait it don't stop, I wanna complete the line
Alot of people think they know me and some even
Knowledge, that they don't, know everything has changed
Just a mind like no one knew me, bonkers
Tonight, I'm on fire, I ain't drunk yet
I ain't shittin' yet, thank you so much for getting to know me
I owe you somethin' I need to say
I left them dang to-do's on my suicide note
Just to make you feel me, don't feel me, wait
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Yeah, so much, better break it down
There's a certain mystique when I speak, don't you get me mistaken for the Mr. Fuzzish
Lookin' for me is the most beautiful woman in the world
And you don't find her anywhere, do you?
I wouldn't wanna spend my whole life with someone so drab
But I gotta keep sayin' the words while I'm on the subject
So you can join me in agreeing that I ain't drunk yet
Ha ha, I got work to do, bitch
I'ma do five years of this music, and I ain't stopping
By the time you hear this song I still ain't done
And I still ain't done, don't worry, I'm rippin'
The road to wealth begins with sight
Peace to the driver of this crazy little donkey headed bus
Who blows his mind when he don't see me? Give me one, two, three
And I'ma be on my way to Colorado from Colorado
Just to see what the fuck I'm got to do, stick my dick in the ground and
Walk with this crazy little donkey headed bus
About forty to 50 munchkins with tires slashed
Some bitch said to look down, I said, "You're a fag!"
She said, "Yeah, but you aint stupid!"
I said, "You know what else is stupid?"
She said, "You can blow your brains, I don't care"
I don't know, maybe I'm crazy
I said, "But don't you go digging yourself an inch deep"
While you're this way, I bet you your skull's missing
And I ain't near the curb as often
While I'm this way, I bet you your brain's almost empty
And I ain't near the hospital as much
While I'm this way, I bet you your life's in jeopardy
"But you know what else is stupid?
I don't care what you say!"
And to anybody who thinks they know something'si did it
Surfing the globe, I was shocked to see I wasn't at the center of the action
While Im goin' leave without a fight (I can't stay here)
Without a cliffhanger, I'm ripped
And heading for the hospital while Im grapple, I don't care
And I don't stop for nothing, I'm firin' at the wall
I'm havin' this dream, I saidit, I aint ceilin'
And I aint ever stop, I'm fizil'
And I don't need no pistols, I'm a palmlancer
No I aint nothin' coming my way
No one, I ain't leavin' without a fight
And I aint ever stop, I'm fizzil'
And heading for the hospital while Im coming up
With a scary feeling (burp!)
And I don't even need to flash a drugensor
He (
====================
Nigga ill grow to love my songs
Ill split this pill like K-Mart
Full of chains, nigga bite the shit off ya
Chinchilla may be my favorite animal
Just try to understand from me
The man that smoked crack, caught em with no crutch
Shit I don't give a fuck, all I wanna do is pee
Got one eyebrow raised on puffin' soda
And all I wanna do is hit em with these phoney puffs
[Marshall growin']
I see you bitches talkin' loud, but you ain't sayin' shit
You talkin' dumb, hello? come on
What's up?
Kids, kicks ass, chumps in the park
Wanna catch a game? Hit the Parkers
Clutch like Christina Musketeers
Or the Jetsons, watch me crush your balls
You see the Giants in the motherfuckin' game
And you play like you love us
You can catch the first shot of Ray Ray
You can rack your brain like Mike Tyson
Or you can join me in giving me props,
But you pussy's so small
You don't know what you're doin'
Chicks grabbin', women grabbin, kids grabbin
Women grabbin, kids grabbin, they grabbing you
Cuz you're soft, they squeezing, they throbbin'
You better sink or die
I'm a G.O.A.T., you're dead
I'm sick of playing with fireplaces, you're a fag
I'm a G.O.A.T., you're dead
I'm a G.O.A.T., you're dead
I'm a G.O.A.T., you're dead
Ha, ha, ha
Don't play with me, you're loose
You're loose
Pistol poppin', body poppin', it's over
Bitches like tomm, pico de gallo, you better get em
Flows like a milano, you get the picture
Like a leaf in the Philip K. Dick's bottle, I'm moppin' liquor
While these players keep throwin' dimes at me
I pop half a couple of grams each month of marijuana
Shit, I can't get on the regular
I'm puking, I'm gettin' a gallbladder attack
Brain damage, cause of these words, I'm cocaine
Like crack is crack, I'm crack
I'll show you how to get 'em, homie
Cocaine is crack, I'm cocaine
I take a little bit, I take a while
But nothing compares
To these double-standards and these trainers
For Ryan's boy's, what's crack?
It compares to, being dropped all over the grass
Like it's cocaine, all it takes is one uppercut
Or kick, or smokin', all three of them, and we're in for a long wait
I've been holdin' back like my salary
Carried out like an arcade game
Bit by bit, until I pick up a crumb
Fell asleep in a pile, nauseous and nauseous
But I'm 'bout to relapse soon enough
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That I can bust from behind and smack this bitch
Crack from a shitty song, and get my faggot brother
Crack from a shitty rapper, and tell him "Don't do it"
And straight pop, and fuck that, I've been makin' my life's
Better than Diddy, when I was on the independent label
I could rock this bitch with more grace than a white rapper
Can Shaista still hold the same weight? It'll be nice
To be here, and I'ma keep pushin'
[Talking Points]
 'Cause while I'm on the receiving end
I bump pop singers, slap songs, and go at record companies
Every bit means, it's just that I'm Pac, and I'm Pac
Def labels, pop singers, and cutthroats
Take hits, and retaliate with snare hooks
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I keep the same mindstate
I was brought up cynical, and straight for the money
Got a shitty parents, and a shitty marriage
Been this way since me and you can bet your ass
There's some shit you can't control your jaw
And you can't be what you want to be
That's why I'm tryin' to be what I feel like
'Cause I don't want to give up, I don't care who is beside me
There's no one on earth that I can be
====================
Girl, you got the wrong impression when you say your song's super catchy.
When I write songs, I don't wanna just
Walk in the door of Hot 97's and just snap
'Cept one,ept two plaques,ept three plaques,ept four plaques
'Cause I'm still gonna make enemies
No matter how many layers of henchman it's I'm still gonna face
You're just another one of your opponents' rappers
Stomp him in the same paces, cause I'm still gonna write
More s***e that Dre did, with the Roadrunner
In the dirt road car, smother him
While I write this, my homies drunk
So they can take a spin, my pot's full of hash
Ihue go chow chow, little homie, this is how you get in trouble for
Being a rapper? Making enemies outta simple rhymes
This is how you make enemies outta music
So when I say you're better than them, your friends better
Your enemies is a little calmer, and you can get away with it
But you know yourself better than me, so
Shady, aftermath, aftermath
We're gonna waste all this time I'm not gonna teach you anything
Not the skill or the patience
You B, whatcha got in you, movein' step is
No partner, what you tryin' to say to me?
We're gonna waste all this energy on you
Move like a man and stand in front of the camera
I ain't showin' respect, my voice is hoarse
I could fuckin' shoot, I'm a sucker for horns I split a hornah in two
Put the heat up I ain't give a fuck, but your thoughts are off the chain
Like a hot potato, not a hot bar, like hot potato
Where's mama? I dunno, maybe we run out of herbs
Nope, mum, I'm eating her up yo
Move like a mad man and stay foolish
Your thoughts are whack, so don't step
'Cept one,ept two plaques,ept three plaques
'Cause I'm still gonna make enemies
No matter how many layers of henchman it's I'm still gonna face
You're just another one of your opponents' rappers
Stomp him in the dirt, cause I'm still gonna write
More s***e that Dre did, with the Roadrunner
In the dirt road car, smother him
While I write this I'm so close to him
I might melt his snowman
I might melt his iceman
I might melt his windman
I might melt his snowman
I hate men, love me, love me now
I'll make a monster out of you, my girl
This is mama, sing mama a line
So sad, how she beat him to this a ridiculous aetna
So mad, her a cunt, so averse, to dying, of AIDS
I'll make you a die of AIDS, of Lee Haney
of Bungo, Bog, of M-16 of course you want to go Down Under?
Of course![Intro]
{Eminem]
Don't be scared, baby, cause I'm gonna bone you!
I said BEA BITCH![Dr. Dre]
A-Alright, lets go, lets jump!
{Boom Boom! Crash! Explosion of Music! Explosion of Sound}
Everyone on the floor, everywhere I turn I'm hearing things!
I don't know what they are, I'm afraid, I just ran out of breath
I heard a car, wheelie, hit the ground and is stuck
Inside this Detroit Wayne Duprilegator, dressed like an Edward Norton
Trotting down Michigan Avenue, peeping into my T-12, staring into a lens
This is Mr. Downing, he's the worst bastard
I've ever seen, and it's worse than what Dre's up to
Anybody out there, get up I'm loco, I'm renegades
Against the grain of the biggie, pac, and cheddar
I'm the old guard, I'll strangle a kid's hand
Look at him bulked up, frisky as fuck (yeah)
Fuck on a track, shoot me an 8, publish me here
First I need a prescription, bright as a Ness, call me prissy
Man the fix is in, pussy like a wrestler dickhead
Fucking sixteen years, hanging with Mark Whalberg
Car crashes on the Las Vegas pier, I'm struck by a truck (hurry up)
A renaming, I'll be the first to toast your fame
{Man, there's a railroad called tehtr that goes by its name}
And as I walk up to the register
====================
i live in a house with a bathroom
in a house with a bathroom
what the f*** you say mama?
you live in a house with a bathroom
what the f*** you say mama?
you live in a house with a bathroom(Eminem)
There's a certain mystique when I speak,
that you notice that's sorta unique,
'cause you know, I don't take long to notice
'cause there's something about a certain,
religiously, I don't take shit
without feeling like a quitter,
quite inhospital
I usually come off like
Roman Polanski: smoking crack while my daughter's fingers are rubbing
this, this is the vibe I'm using this
as an oral sex tool, I mean tool, tool, tool
It's easy when I'm metaphorically man I'm a trippin',
man I'm a little bit shinin', bit insensitive,
but it's all drein', drein' and fools,
but it's all drein' and fools,
I'm a sucker for plot, when beats compare notes
I'm a sucker for punchlines, when s***ymes run they're the same
and when I spit to compare notes
it rhyme equaliser, I'm a sucker for suspense
that joker, I'm ruthless, ruthless
I snatch a loose ball and leave it at the feet of your mama
I'm a sucker for suspense, that's what the lady's saying
conversation, it's an uptight versita
no need for revising my past, just know I'm hungry
and I'm a sucker for punchlines, when s***ymes run they're the same
and when I spit to compare notes
it rhyme equaliser, I'm a sucker for plot, when s***ymes run they're the same
and when I spit to do is like putting a fork in the fire
so while you down mama, just be conscious that I'm cooking up the plot
im hungry so im aminated by this cake im amin addicted
to this drama, this is it mama, this is it mama
we're in the sixth week, yeah, we're almost ready, here let me sit up
up front, you know you're the boss and I'm the steward
now, you know the way I'm wired up, I am stressed out from work
and from home I'm not going to budge, I am you're my brain on some fuckin' headache
now, this is my life, I'mocked to this music, I'm kickin' it
yeah, I'm rippin' shit off, locked up, theft
now, back up, you know I got you open, these statements are lies
we don't know shit, like you did not know
you ran my music, you blew up, we all took to the radio
now, fuck this, jump in the car, run, jumpin' jockeys
through the snow, s***, we're headed for the hall, (hurry up)
We're headed for the hall, (you run!)
The Kuniva, muhhi, the adrenaline junkie
And this ain't shit to cry on, this isn't shit to cry on
Daddy, it's you and me, dare I cry?
It's not a battle, it's who's gonna win
Marshall, you know I got you up front, but I'm your man
front, I'm your man neither one y'all know
See that blade in my brain, Marshall?
Is it a trap? It's a shame that my music isn't falling
on guys, especially amongst females
But I'm 'bout to burst that door soon enough
On the track that got my heart racing, like a beat throb
No matter what color you're, bitch
Whatever your skin is, whatever your name (Hailie, please)
To the children, hold up the Word, tell me why you do it
This is your life, live it as it is and see what you do
But I'm banned from all bars, parties, events, ladies
I'm do Iraean, I'm la-di-dum
Straight out the diuce, playa di dum
Out the corneridas in the Honda e-bike gym
Ballin' outside, rockin' outside
I'm a triathlons champion, and I just finished second
To Ben Stiller in the boogie jack
And shot Stilfriends at the Ice House
Broke down, played a clip in the parking lot
And got a check for assault, for what you on
Didin' on anybody, I'm just a regular guy
Relax, I'm just tryna get my weight up
I
====================
'Cause they don't know shit, and I know that
I am what they speak to hear
I am what they see before they see this video
I am what they see after
I am what they see
I will be everything to them
I am what they see
I will be everything to them
[Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak that you notice
Cause it is, just me rappin' and I speak with aplomb
Concert after concert
Radio stars whisper
A couple hits and a catchy hook, but what matters
A lot less who you call friend or foe
Supposed to be everything that you don't get
When I step on the microphone and bang on your beat
You sit back with your drinks, let the beat commence
Shit, these beat-it's forgotten when I'm boss
And I'm no stranger to stardom
I know it can happen to all too real, but I'm determined to make it happen
So I'm sober till I vomit, cover my mouth with my hands
Drop the muthafuckin ass, you pussies
I'll be right back with a vengeance, so beat the hell outta living
And feed the piss to cockards while I'm makin' my own
So run, you want some?
Libido, non mi sessuno, non mi sessuno
No matter how many times I say niete fed to me
The only thing that stays in me is lust
So if you don't wanna fuck me, then get the fuck out my face
Now grab the remote, someone get the bottom out and make it right
I'm bad world, I'm a bad influence
I'm damned if I'm stupid, I'm a bad MC
Good thing I got a bad bone in my ass, too bad for you
In the sequel, I found a way to poke fun at people that already knew me
Like a blind man who just struck out
Asked his agent what I could do for sound, he said...
Don't EVER let me tell you not to tell you not to talk to you
That's why I'm explaining this to you today
Cause I just happened to meet you at the mixer
And I just happened to be your new boyfriend
I met you on the first page of the Magic Lantern
And I just fucked you off; you'd be on my short list of girls
To sit next to' you in meetings about where you live
I met you on the first page of the Magic Lantern
I said...
Guess who? (Oh man) Marshall Mathers
FUCK YOU!?!?!
Conversation, Praying, Blood and Fire
Alright, here we go.
Alright, here we go.
I'm going to take this opportunity to drop the bomb right now
You know, I'm so cold an' I just love you
And you're just such a sweetheart
And I'm just like every other girl in my world (Oh shit)
I'm so sorry I can't be your man
My love, this rage and confusion
The way I'm trying to shove it, I'm crushing it
It's driving me crazy
This dream is coming to me
This spot, this life is so full of holes
An' I can just pull up and not think of another way
I'm dancing to the hurl of all you boo
And standing in front of this crowd is sooo much fun
And this song, it's about to get huge, it's taboo
I need a freaking idol, I have one waitin'
Oh no I don't, I'm too awa** busy
Gettin' skullie, crack, and fixin' up a hole
An' you think you fine now, you think it's too late
You're right, an' it's already so much better
To be in a place you can be, Lord knows your place
But I don't wanna spend more time with you
But hold on an' we can even fuck, off
You're about to witness my full potential (Oh shit)
You haven't fully embraced me, off the top of my head
I can see it, you're starting to lose faith
On all the songs that are heavy with your questions
'Cause I'm gonna need an idol to pop off, off, off
And every single one of you women is full of fucking holes
An' I can barely stand it, I can't spit it, I can't bow it
An' I need an idol, I ain't seen one since Prince
I came from a small town, an' I know your pain, my God
An' I'm from the D, an' I'm from New York
An' I don't need an image to be sympathetic,
I come from a small but
====================
I just wanna talk about Pac, his music and my career,
My whole life I was shaped by rap,
I was shaped by K-Fed, and by everything that he stood for,
Everything he was put out. I saw the light at the end of the tunnel,
But I had to leave that world and go to hell,
I didn't wanna go alone, did I?
Motherfuckers, Pac wasn't put together for this game to be shine,
He had to be fucking wild, and Pac wasn't put together for this bitch to hate,
He had to be me, he had to be, somewhere close by,
Straight out the box, cause man, I love that game,
Yeah, you got it Pac, pack the weaponry,
The Zantacs, you ready?
Now what you get is like a nightmare,
You go in the game with, like five minutes left,
And the only way you're gonna come back, is to come right out
And tell somebody, "You got something nice to say, bitch,
I like that game, but you better heartily swallow that shit,
And everything you grew up with, you just blew up,
You been gon be another asshole
Or you could be the next fuckin asshole, and that's just my opinion,
But just in case you didn't know,
I'm the kind of guy that never, never, never gave a fuck,
Makes no sense to try and lecture me so fast,
That's a rhetorical trick, I already knew the whole formula,
But you all know the rules and I already had a pretty decent grasp,

Something's wrong (what's up?)
Check your clock,Fred's sweeping your floors
I heard this world's ending yesterday
Fred's leaving you
====================
It's like I'm in the back of a squad seperating the front door
And the front seat is the only weapon that I have left
To stop a nigga on the loose from rappin' while he's pimpin'
And I ain't startin' no shots, I ain't shootin' no shots
Lil Wayne, I got a secret nugget, you be comin' home with it
And I ain't startin' no shots, I ain't shootin' no shots
Wass up tell me what the fuck I fuck up been down cause you got shot up in the studio
And I'm through wit the most dope shit you can diss in one track, cuz I'm back
And I still get fucked up trying to talk about nigga Donnell see
Whatever he was tryna do to me, just let me know
Whatever you thought, whatever you story is tellin'
Or is it Eckart, Biggie or Cage?
Whatever you thought, I'm back, I'm back
And that's all I could think of
It's Shady 1-2
[Chorus:]
Ahh fuck that, it's the one and only
I'm done, I regret it, I'm done with it
I'm done with it, I'll never call you that again
That's all you got to say
And I won't be renewin' my four year, you know what I'm saying
I'm done with it, I love youDoc
[Eminem]
I tried to give this shit less, but then I tried to give this shit more
And now I'm tryin to give this shit to you, more than I got, and you didn't respond
So after I give you this generic jab I'm like "Drop the bomb bitch!"
You're kidding, Dre, you should've slain me
Instead you throw a temper tantrum, we could've sworn that you tossed the bat
And hit it out of the park like "Til we both fall"
Cause then I lashed out and started ganging up the hair
Like you threw a punchline, shit that you're not, Captain?
You throw a punchline and we both fall
Like the Octomom, Captain, when I drop the mic I'm almost choked
Like I won't breathe, because I'm so down
I'm so sorry I'm so lost without my mic
Without it I can't play the sax, without my wife around,
It's like I'm all alone, without my wife around
It's like I'm all alone, without my wife around
[Chorus]
[Diddy:]
Came to the world at a time when it's in need of a champion
To match my every word, rhyme throughout
And put J-At inside the punchlines and make sure my pops don't get killed
Hit the earth like I stepped on a wrong day
But now J-At are here, and I said here
And everywhere I go the mic boys play, they scream out here
All the niggas that ain't know what to do with their first clue
They hiding young, they ain't knowing what to do with their first clue
'Cause they came to dominate the rap game now, give or take a clue
We ain't stopping for no one, we got we've got
We've had it, it's over, it's or how?
[Chorus]
[Diddy:]
Came to the world at a time when it's in need of a champion
To match my every word, rhyme throughout
And put J-At inside the punchlines and make sure my pops don't get killed
Hit the earth like I stepped on a wrong day
But now J-At are here, and I said here
And everywhere I go the mic boys play, they scream out here
All the niggas that ain't know what to do with their first clue
They hiding young, they ain't knowing what to do with their first clue
[Verse 1: Diddy]
They came to the world at a time when it's in need of a champion
To match my every word, rhyme throughout
And put J-At inside the punchlines and make sure my pops don't get killed
Hit the earth like I stepped on a wrong day
But now J-At are here, and I said here
And everywhere I go the mic boys play, they scream out here
All the niggas that ain't know what to do with their first clue
They hiding young, they ain't knowing what to do with their first clue

Come here, you little motherfucker
When I unload your last mag, you better unload yours

Boy who could ever predict
What would happen if Marshall hit tech back
And got crowned cypher
Or if not, He wouldn't exist
These are my thoughts on Thanksgiving
"His is a track that he's worked on and he's worked on it
So here goes that fuckin' E, "Marshall you fuckin' words are goddamn"
That's it, that's all there is to it dawg"
[Eminem]
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
And spray-paint the front of my house
And walk around with a whole block to myself?
Look, I ain't that fuckin' brain dead either
I'm just a regular guy
That will lose none of his sense of humor
"His brain is all jagged, his ropes all he's tryin' to do is laugh"
That's the bad news, the long run, it's bad for your mind
"He's just a regular guy who's trying to get his hair pulled"
That's the long run, it's bad for your heart
"It's also a long time, bad news to say bad
It's also a long time, good news and you're welcome back"
That's the bad news, the long run, it's bad for your mind
"It's also a long time, bad news and you're welcome back"
[Paul Rosenberg]
Here we go again, let's end this shit, for real, for real
Long as I can, I Run They Scare Tactics, Slaughterhouse
[Eminem]
No matter how many times that I say the nastiest and the most insane
That I screw up, it ain't funny anymore, vixen
I'm sick of being judged, I'm gonna jack this shit up
And add an extra bit of irony, when I'm rhyming
And every time I write a word, shit, I got a new disease
Contagious of people with panic attacks, get a sign
From the emergency department get you checkin' for flushing, man
I go in, there first responders
Come comin' with blunts, say whit the word
I got a rash and it gets worse then Worcestershure Flushing
I get blunts, and I got diarrhea
I get blunts, and I got a habit of getting diarrhea
Like I got an epiphany, said I'd be a doctor sooner
Got a appointment, tomorrow the doctor comes
Wit't take an hour, it'll take an hour, Nat like a stare
You stare, puzzled, like Nat Druid there goes another whack
Hug a kitten, it'll grow back its head after its owner buries it
A fat slut with a tube in her mouth, I mistake it for pneumonia
I'll jack a kitten, I'll jack a kitten, I'll jack
I'll jack, a kitten, I'll jack
I'll jack, a kitten, I'll jack
Man, I'll jack, a pound of grass, kick it back with just enough balls to stop the Apocalypse
Man, I'll jack, a pound of grass, kick it back, with just enough balls to stop the Apocalypse
[50 Cent - Eminem]
Keep bumpin' this shit, till the kids are tellin' me
Peep me, while I'm standin' next to you, breathing a strange, charge
This mystical shit, I'm about to transform, I'm about to walk out
Blaze a pound of grass every time I ride a bike,
I got a whole new wardrobe to show, I'm ready to blow
Off the top, to my right, I'm in the tailpipes
I'm truly and truly here, come squeeze
The only one who's sane, who can't believe he's still alive
To understand me is a year and a half from now
When I was still in diapers, to my eyes, they were like pictures of me
To my left and right, there was no doubt in my mind as soon as I saw them
As much as I hated Earth, as bad as they were, and as innocent as you could get
As soon as I stepped on one, I'd look like a fool, for a fuckin' minute
Cause these eyes fuckin' look like a (Boy) Hollandaard, mister Earth
[Eminem - Eminem - Eminem 2 x]
Yo, yo, this will be the greatest
Oh, I don't know, I gotta really bad feeling about this jacket
This is my life, I'll never wear it right
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't shit
No more than a girl's body
Yeah, look why I added a strap to your bra
You should of never worn it, you're a pussy now
Next thing you know you're bare-chested and
====================
How do I get the word out in a word, I'm drunk
Fuckin brain's racing I can't stay out a fuckin MC's studio
But I thought I hit a low point, then I stumbled onto your mic
And I'm still working my way my way, you're gonna have a lot of people ignore you
And they may be right or wrong
'Cause I ain't been doped up yet
Doped up, up, up, up, I dunno
I just thought I was knowin' what it's like to be tellin' lie
At your lowest
When you're stuck in traffic,
Forgot your license at the rush
With ticket for blow up your gas lighter and lighter
Too much pride, then you slam the brakes and don't get turned up
I'm not about to let a nigga come and get me
I can't stress like I can't blast like a damn Pinto
I can't, believe in this, I'm not just a nigga with a nickel's worth of parts
I'm about to be ripped off, like a damn Ford engine
This'll fuckin' teach you not to come envy
To your face, tell a friend to spit on you
OK, you wanna get fucked, but you don't gotta come steal part of the pie
We'll be alright
I got 6 pack of l'amost, vodka and cava
And when I'm gone, I'm not scared
I got 26 tvs, a mule and a shotgun
And I'm not headed for the sauna
I said, we'll be alright
I got 6 pack of l'amost, vodka and cava
And when I'm gone, I'm not scared
I got 26 tvs, a mule and a shotgun
And I'm not headed for the sauna
I got the news on the second week I was alive
My little brother was killed in a plane crash
Just a lotta thoughts about his parents and wept loud as I did
I'm not gonna lie, I'm still wid him
I got a son and a daughter
They both have moms and dads
But they don't know what's going through my mind's eye of yours
So when you hear this song by the ugly lady
Your brain goes berserk and ititates
Your heart goes fizzling and you become lost
Your mind is like a junk house full of broken bricks
And I'm the definition of depravity, depravin'
You're so demented
I'm demented, you're demented, you're demented
I'm demented, you're demented, you're demented
I'm demented, you're demented, you're demented
I'm demented, you're demented, you're demented
Yo, record, I'm lookin' for a hook
In a club with a crowd and a bunch of dancers
Who take notes, blow a shit out of each hand
There's probably a half-dozen of you left
Who just turned to drinking cola (yeah)
And you don't know if Dupri don't run out the ganja too
And you drink cola, you snort coke and smelly
So you get all quiet and sit back the whole night
But I'm real, I'm scared (I'm real)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
Yea, to my inner weak, to my inner weak
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm so serious, to my inner weak
I'm serious, I'm serious (I'm serious)
I'm so serious, to my inner weak
I'm so serious, to my inner weak
I've got some things on my plate, that I need to take a look at
And look at my VaticanI don't get why' s goin' on
All I know is I'm being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's very, very hard to describe
The feeling of unity that comes when you're all in one place
Is incredible, and it isn't supposed on me
It's a slap in the face, I'm not in the mood to be pitiful
I know, there's a reason why a lot of people get mad at me

====================
You can do anything you set your mind to
Its not saying goodbye, it's saying forthrightness
And I got my mind blown, learnin' to rap grammar a
She can't even sing, cant' even say c'
She's kinda blown out of proportion
She's seem to be on a quest to be the best at
She's quest, I ain't getting her, let her go
I'm a quest, I ain't getting her, let her go
I'm a quest, I ain't getting her, let her go
She's kinda blown out of proportion
Shit, where the fuck you mind is?
From New York to London, man, its a quest, ain't no need for apologies
For he's all that I'm really seeking, its all I know
I just want to be the best, man
And I got a lot of things to be proud of, including being the first white rapper to record 5
And fuck all the other white rappers out there
I kept singin' that I wanted to blow up the charts, I was
Came to be served, served
And served
But blood feuding, I'm inclined to murder y'all all
All these different levels, all these different levels
You kind of get the picture, Imma tell this crowd
Conversation, it's all good, I don't feel like performing
Same verse, Same verse, Same verse
Same Damn Tee, MC's always shoving it back
Back up at whoever's singing this better
When your verse is up, I ain't got time to sit around and talk about
Same Damn Tee, he ain't got time to sit around and ponder
Why is everyone hating on him, he ain't got no time for sit and ponder
And everybody just feels like he's fucked this up, he ain't got no time
Yo, I feel like I'm kicking a thousand booty-waving demons
Into this penitentiary, writ large
for all the rap I do
I ain't writing poems, I'm a relentless thinker
That'll get you to the punch of my poetry if I'm behind
Brain damage, I been doing this for a long time
So it's evident, it's time for em to get it right
Fuck this shit, fuck this system, fuck this emcees
Yeah, fuck this whole system
I'm getting so damn hungry I'm losing my water
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm thirsty
Oh my God, I forgot, I'm hungry
My God, I forgot my soul, my hunger
Knew that you were about to have my head crushed beneath you
Are you insane? I ain't insane
I've been through hell and back, and still refuse to turn back
Now I remember, it was like that for so long ago
I refused to open my eyes to the fairytale that is this I'm returning to
And the hush fell on the bright sunny day, it's so late at night
I woke up in the hospital the next day next to nothing
But ashes, craters, bloody stains, what down you ask?
Wasn't quite what you thought it was, I was placed
In the category of "unpleasant to the touch"
Blow you to sleep, woke up later than you supposed
In the category of "unpleasant to the touch"
What is it, now that you've all but told me to stop
The next day next thing I'm on something
Like I'm in the category of "unpleasant to the touch"
Where is you at, are you still in the category of "unpleasant to the touch"?
Oh my God, I'm breaking out of my dang diapers
I can't do this, I have to, someone will
Please help me, I'm in third grade, class picture hands
Where was you at, three letters an hour, four letters an day
No limit to what I can do, now lets go
Keeps me posted, you're not taking me no prisoner
I'm trying to, stop and take a minute to reflect
Look at my, you're so damn cool
You're the only one who understands work,
And all you do is take notes, I'm scribbling lines
Long as you understand that you are a man
I can never repay you for what you do
Run so fast
====================
Pre-meeting!
The first task I'll ever set foot in your hands
Preparation and I, went at it like a pro,
We both had options, but neither one of us wanted to go the route of
Debt-bomber, and he's already turned his back on you
You know, I'm sick of dealing with this shit,
What's it worth? It's worth it, it's what you wanted
If I fail, then you fail, better be careful what you wish for
You definitely don't want to go through this again
You already said you plan to get divorced from me,
What am I supposed to do?
Just lay back, get your apron flaps rolled,
Move like Venus and get your butt kicked,
Slap butt and pillory you a kiddie,
We'll be friends, I'll be the bastard to fail to recapture
Verse 2:
I'll be by your side, neglected no where to be found,
It'd be a pity luck, and luck alone would have me turned into a dancer
I never would of got to call, but sometimes you gotta just let it go
It was only about a year old, I made a transition,
I started feeling withdrawn and had to start giving up rhymes for me
I was dealt a fatal blow, I was dealt a fatal blow
I've come to find myself a judge
First I'll solemnly swear on my mother's corpse
That I never, ever, ever gave up in song
I was never gonna hold no power that I could think of to reach out and grab you
I have been holding the soap opera, you know the story's over
Oh no, it's over, someone's gonna save me or the show
I can no longer pretend to be cool
I got a list of rappers that you all hate
You may aswell write a rhyme about me
And I'll be like "That's not good!"
Fuck that, I'm gonna c*** it,
Go home, you better never let me go no more
You've caved time and again to the times,
You've let me down so why the fuck would you change?
But I will not succumb to temptures
I got a list of rappers that you all hate
You may aswell write a rhyme about me
And I'll be like "That's not good!"
Fuck that, I'm gonna c*** it,
Go home, you better never let me go no more
You've let me down so why the fuck would you change?
But I will not succumb to temptures
I got a list of rappers that you all hate
You may aswell write a rhyme about me
And I'll be like "That's not good!"
Fuck that, I'm gonna c*** it,
Go home, you better never let me go no more
You've told me, learnt the hard way
You were fed up with the bullshit of the day
You've told me how you hate me 'cause I came along
To battle you, you can do anything you want, to do shit that you hate
Cuz you've learned, it's time for you to change
Fuck it, let's go, (repeat)
All you cuss at me 'cause I'm ugly as a lady?
Fuck sucker punch me, I'm ugly as a rapper?
You're fired, I can't quit, I only stall
So they can suck my dick, while I piss and spit
Dick and dick, and dick and dick
Fuck it, I'm a fucking menace, with a gun to kill a man
Fuck a rapper, with a gun to kill a woman
I'm like Rage to the finish line, you know the line?
I'm tired of always having to go back in time
And ending up just like that chick from "Guilty Conscience"
Who'd rather go back in time, or beat this shit again
Then go to Somalia and just mutherfuckers, and have a baby
And I'm tired of these motherfuckers spraying shit
And using me as a weapon, when they can just bash in my ass
And murder my ass better be no joke, I'm like (Hailey)
I'm the girl from the show who just happens to be a comedian
And I said she was just joking when she said she's just a mean one
And I hate the dickass who gets to toss bombs
On stage, on TV, who gets to say what's just stupid of course I'm the goof on these jokes
And everything's just dicks peeing on themselves
Hailey Jade, I swear to God, I'm the dutch that you thought you were with us for
Last week the dumb blonde one of your guys got murdered
And you thought you were going to win
====================
Embarrassed,
But the kids love me and they're not making me out to be a bust,
They love me and they want me too,
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right,
The conflict has died,
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right,
It's that time again,
You're embarrassed,
And you're embarrassing yourself
Your so over-confident you're tired of being admired
And your demonstrated temperament's just an optical on this compass
You're not, are you?
You hover over your competitors' shoulders
And you let your guard up, your ego's trying to cry out,
"I can't no longer play these ass weak,
You're standing in the way, James Todd!"
You're not, James Todd is not!"
You're not, Todd is not!
You're embarrassing yourself,
So is Jennifer Lopez
Embarrassed,
But the kids love you, they want you too
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right,
The kids love you too
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right
The kids love you, yeah
They want you too,
They want you too
They tell you right off the get-go
"I'm an asshole!"
You're an asshole,
You're running your asses off
Embarrassed,
But the kids love you, they want you too
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right,
The kids love you, too
Embarrassed,
But the kid's right
The kids love you, too
'Cause I can no longer play this game,
I'm trying to sell a toilet paper mugs,
I'm trying to visit your momma,
And kiss every girl on the face,
So I'm admitting, uh, my penis is a little large,
But I'm not giving up, I'm standing and acting embarrassed,
And I'm not fucking around anymore,
I'm eating lunch alone,
And trying to sneak in Mom's room,
And open a bedroom door,
And there's tons of surprises,
And scary shit to deal with, plus I know that some of you won't,
And I won't flee in a hurry,
But first, please respect my decision,
It's making a big mistake,
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We're going through changes, force through restraints
No emotion, just hunger and thirst
Went through clothes, fed clothes
Permanently, end up in a wardrobe that'll keep on burning
Don't want a red herring, please don't interpret it as weakness
It's not her doing, she's working on it
Some bullshit it's her making,
But emotions run deep as oceans give way
Bridge, swim against the wind, through the heavy of battles
Battle's over, I win, I'm steeling my team
And I want every man, woman and child
Let alone parents, to hold up the lights and hope that they don't go into cardiac arrest
While shaking their knees and shaking their heads
Yeah baby do it, it ain't fun
It's making more mistakes than I made,
I'm making bigger mistakes than Obama didn't make,
I ain't got the gas to do it again,
I'm a man of my word, I like words, I like handing them out
But I prefer they go out on a spree, so I'm keeping my hands off the pulse of the local news
(Don't sell that damn map to Baghdad, they're running out of points to blast Rome)
Missouri Southern, I know you want me, I want you too,
In fact, I'll be the first to admit it, I'm from Missouri,
I know you want me, I want you too,
In fact, I'll be the first to admit it, I'm from Missouri,
I grew up in the wrong world, confused as to why
I went to the bathroom, blew a horn then ran
Down the back street of St. Louis, pissed
And killed a cop, another fag, crying out
(Missouri Southern, I'm from Missouri, I don't need you to explain)
And graduated from Missouri Southern
To the new fag town of St. Louis,
Now, I'ma make you laugh, cause Missouri Southern,
Is still in the mother fucking black, no matter how funny you are, you can't take it again!
You are now about to witness the true colors of America!
(Fades out)
Now, you might be thinking, what the fuck kind of kids thinks
That I'm some gangsta who pistol hides, while I run a gas station?
Turn around and buy some nuttin' steel, and if you buy that, I

I saw the throne was empty and empty
And it felt so right and I just wanted to fill it
With flavour through sodas, pop sodas, sodas
Sodas is that what you mean?
Is it sodas or is it pronto' that I just a little boy?
I'd be a horrible actor
If I acted in front of a camera, I would never get convicted
I would never be caught lying
I would never be caught of luring someone with a promise to come out
Coming out of the closet is the evil seed
Coming out of the closet is the evil seed
Doesn't mean you're out of your mind, it just means you're coming out of the closet
And everybody welcome comes comin'

Any given day, we can bring you closure
We can come to you
You can call me crazy, you crazy, I can carry on

I'm just bringing it back}{Versespark}

Hold your pants!

He just keeps takin' down the block a maniac!

But Ive got the nerve to be who I am,
It always comes back around to get me,
When Ire Dirty muthafuckas wrong,
It all comes back around to get me,
When Ire Dirty muthafuckas wrong,
It always comes back around to get me,
When Ire Dirty muthafuckas right, fuck Satan,

I come back to life, see my ass up in the sky
Now every rap that I write, niggas know what I'm about out here
I'ma make them wanna come back here, (repeat)
And get a muthafuckin' win
out this world, come back to this world
Now it's my time to meet y'all, here come these nigga's
And show 'em how what it's like to be me,
Being a criminal through the eyes of a real nigga
Got a mental illness that just screams "blah blah blah"
Freak you to high, think for a second, see?
This world is my penance, I die once I blow this curse
Let this song judge me, I become a new criminal through these
different eyes, aiyyo)
My friends think that I's a slut, yo, I'm a dope mess
They realicians, think again, this is a joke
I'm sorry I'm so honest,
This is my respect, I'm the peace now accept me,
This is my style, I just be sayin' my songs in a trance
But I still keep my cool, this is my style
I still write, still dance, even in my grave state
I still hold the sacred, holy ink
For this nigga to respect, I'll spit this fine fine paper
(Yo dawg, you ain't never see the sweat floor, youdinand]
Yo, you think you got it you're a dope player
I got some raps, some knockin' you off, some knockin' you off
Now you stare into a camera lens,
You ain't got to explain how I do that
I can't even say the same shit I say, I'm insane
In fact, I'm insane I Ronnie Ramsey
I do insane shit, I'm sorry I mess up my rhyme
I just wish I was dead, mad or famous
When I pull up like Brett Favre
My left eyebrow's like Jada, and my right eyebrow's like Jasmine
I fucked up my rhyme, I don't mean to sound like a jerk though
My right

It's like the Mr. Fuzz in Love!
Yaaaaa hear me...
Let me remind you of what this is all about
I'm a robot,
Robot, yes I know, but this is my life and this is my love
And I'mma always be
This is how I'm supposed to be
This is why I chose you
This is why I chose you
This is why I chose you
This is why I chose you
You made me, I will always be
This is why I chose you
This is why I chose you

Verse 1 [Kuniva]:
Yo I was destined to fail, I was destined to fail
To...
fail, with a pen and a pencil
I'd rather try to hit it grand,
than just blow up my knees
And have it done
So the party starts, without...
Sticks and stones ain't no fightin' in it,
I'm just glad I'm here, I love you
And I'mma keep tryin' to be here
So everyone by themselves, let's get on the floor
Let's start it up, let's see who can greatest give it the best shot
You're the women's champion, I'm the biggest fan you'll ever get
I give you my all for life, but you're my Scott, your Ray
Your my worst nightmare, but sometimes, you just say what you mean it's side to say it
And it's really ugly, you little fuckin' hug, and lock it away
And fuck it, if it comes to it, I'll have you pegged as the bomb
'Cause everything you touch is a trigger, my finger was under you
The first time I fucked someone, they said they aint hardcore, but theyin' too guess who
That's a lie, they sayide they some freestyles from Japan, but theyre' not spittin'
Somebody turn the vacancy up, so I can make someone who'll wreck you when you fuckers call
Some shit you talk a bum, but you aint got no nuts, you aint made
You should be at the club playing shitself, you need to run
Yourndo a little bidding off your songs, so I'm a little surprised your own a lil bit down
But I'm just, I'm not here to make no fuckin' sound, I'm just here to just make a sound
I could be wrong nigga, I just know that the worst nigga gonna say nah
I know I'm a bitch, I know I'm a slut, but I never been known to brag
Nah, I ain't a slut, I'm just a regular nigga who can brag
I'm a R&B; about as honest as you can get
But I'll shit on anybody, black or white, who dawg's gets what I get
I'm a man, gotta keep these nuts away, so if there's any, that I might hurt
I'm gunna break your nose
If you diss me, then I'ma break your neck
You better tell the police
I'm a known quantity, they better believe that I'm a big bald eagle
Cold enough to set off a fire truck
Just enough to drop it on the street, and just enough to spit it
Somebody help me, I'ma get you to safety
I said, if you think I'm hot, you should go
But I ain't got nowhere else to go, I'm going to start a new song dawg
Go back to the crib, and steal the key from her ass
Someone give me the mic, somebody just let me outrun
And before I start this song, I'd like to say hello to
My name is (what?)
My name is (who?)
My name is
Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (huh?)
My name is (what?)
My name is
Slim Shady
Hi! My name is (what?)
Excuse me, (my name is) (who? My name is)
Slim Shady
Can I get the attention of the class (huh my name is, what my name is)
For one second My name is (My name is Slim Shady)
Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh
====================
Just bit me for trying to act like Eminem
I'm smackin baby talkin voice over voice mail man
Your tryna talk my shit son
You got me sentimental
Pick up the pieces, I'm shit if you tryin to play with my hair
My respect is deserved
Holla if you ever need me in a car crash
'Cause I drive like I'm from the 'burbsYo! This is Foxtrot from the 10 yo
Man you a bust foxtrot I made that shit to pop off
And yes you, yes you
I, I, G-G-God, Phantom of the operation I blow your liver out
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo

You hear me? It's me

I said you better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

[Chorus]
Mic check, more hate in the streets, DJ's in the mix
Ballin' ass-ho, 40 they're got it down to a Tougher than Dirt is Down To a Pup In A Silent Shady Nightclub
[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm about to lose my mind, I can't find my words to describe it
The ecstasy, the rush, the rush
When I think I'm losing my mind
in the trance, I can't beippled off syllables
Could be my whole life, more poetry, more autobiography
It'll be a beautiful piece, I might just write a whole song for it
Awaiting, it's going to happen, it's going to be a fine thing
The music's tremendous, the booth's enormous, the vibe's tremendous
If I ever lose my mind I'ma have a fucking nightmare
I'm dreamin' I'm going to wake up, mutiny's at stake
'Cause here I go, I might not be able to talk to you now
but I feel so, so alone, so cut
So everything's single and raw, I'm wandering off into another world
Like I came to be
In this new place, in this new place, I'm teething with yeast
this is incredible, I've been searching for, glory, peace, peace
Time is passing me by, I'm running out of time
I just want my back, let these elephants shine
They say I'm special, I'm just special
I'm 'bout to hit the road, special, my back, it's special
Em, Snoop Dogg on vocals, I just finished my solo and it's a movie
Now I gotta tell you this again, I ain't making this shit up
I'm special, I'm special, I'm special
I finally believe in life, in order for me to be special
Or else I'm gonna end up dead, fuckin' man I'm dying
But I believe in this shit, and this whole 'hood I was wrong
I would never believe in this, I'd never be that crazy
In fact me to the level you see in this movie, you'd never believe
In this, I ain't got no time, industry, guts, guts
Yeah I think I committed a felony
Sheriffs couldn't tell me shit about me
When you goin' do these crazy things and you crazy
And you start shootin', you probably get stranglin'
[Royce Da 5'9"]
Wait a minute.. did the
====================
I just bought a whole truck of plastic surgeons
To operate on me to open it
Open the can, can's full of detergent and
Mix it with some xanax and some lofolin and let me pee
Now I'm living like a recluse
With a swollen jaw and a can of soda pop
And all I'm doing is spraying farts
I got a few more uppers to sell, I figured I best let loose
Rappers, I'm your neighbor keepsakin'
I'll pee on you, then I'll spray
You stare at me like you forgot your jaw
Then I might let go of my gun and let go of my spat
Then I might let go of my spat and spit
I spit to whoever you ain't got on your porch
I'd probably let half of a seven inch can sit in my living room
And wake my pregnant chick up
When I'm gone I can still poppin' pills in the car
I'm still goin' insane
Even slept through my entire life I
Still rhyme
So you can try, but I won't let you in
I got a bigger grievance than wassoner
Who ain't find shit that he can't dish out
His last beef, the owner of this shit
Came home and stuck it out with me, 'cause I spit shady
Then went on the radio and said fuck the party
And fat people are shit when shit is cold
Then went on the beach and ducked and gotached
And made a couple of hundred dollars at the bottom
But I'm only offensive if you ain't familiar with my shit
'Cause you don't sit in line at the liquor store
You standin' at the line, it doesn't make a difference
If you're white, red or blue, you changed your mind
If you're a girl you've had it with someone
You've changed your whole way of doing shit
You're fuckin' me I'm fuckin' you
I got a bigger grievance than wassoning a baby
On myans, razors and sawdust
I got a 7 inch by 3 inch Mosin-ian
Plastic surgeon, Mosin-born grenade
You know how often I hear this talk
Over and in the media, 'cause the plastic surgeon
Has been a part of my life since it was a baby
And out of respect, I would never do anything like this
I would like to thank everybody for being patient
And bearing witness to my granddaughters coming to terms
With dealing with the loss of their mother
As I await the day that I don't feel like makin' a sound
For that kind of album, that's the sound of my dangst
Dangst, you cant make me lose my mind
You must be doin' the D and K
els the first ones that dont come from behind
That got the M on this one, can we pretend that it was a bogey?
2001 and the whole of music
Be a nigga and be a danger to your self-esteem
And get served famous
And get served famous, please
And crack on, yes and NO, steven brooks
Royce Da 5'9, Joe Budden, is Joe in Joe's corner?
And what kind of mother would invite his daughter out for drinks
No matter how bubbly and coppin' she sounds
Just to get tome, no more Joe in the club
And no more lemme tell ya, her bubbuss was rough
She played piano at the dance
And pretty boy forgot his belt in it
And what the fuck is wrong with that?
She came back but on the count of swings
Only two overturned, and that's that
He ain't went for no records hes gettin' Alzheimer's
And no more Joe
Now here he comes from but he didn't come from obscurity
He came from the underground, when you was the most coveted
And everyone wanted to run their mouth
And make you say what you said so all they did was scream
And clap at you so you can't hear
You better shut up or get popped
And don't ever give me another opportunity come on
This is Shady's song, he said he wants to blow the horn shut
He ain't coming to party, he's just ringing the same ones
Now I get to the point, who's gonna get the brunt of this, (huh boy)
Music is a sickness
Everybody dies cause of it
Everybody dies cause of it
Every day every single person who walks this path
Dont never know, whats goin on in life is just too much to absorb
It's like there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing, all he knows is that you're comin' from a different ilk
You're homos,
====================
Don't ask me what the fuck I owe you
You fucking morons
don't get me mistaken get me mistaken
for pimping my ass
I'm a be smart ass like Jude
and follow the smarts around
while I smoke a fat pound of grass
I wanna help you burn fat
but I wanna bet
I take fat too, so I take fat
but I'm still wimpy, so
I said I aint "wifty", I aint a cunt no more
but I aint "let it go" I aint a sheep to be muzzled
so I'm a leap before I get slurred out of my dre and dre-boy
repeat droppin the freddo and i'm ok?
i aint looking for shit to be a little fruitless
i got an idea, go down to the basement and
open the drawer and let me let you pop it up
so you know you got a little something for me to pull from
I'm a leap like a spider, I can't be flat, but I can still kick ass
and if you're tryin to put me in the mood, drop the microphone
quit playin and just let it go...
[Obie Trice Hook]
Doody
I drop a tear in the rhyme,
theres no rhyme that I aint freddy
I'm just makin' tunes so you know you're a tramp
I aint looking for pussies to punch over the mic
so form a task and I'll ask dem a plaque
So I start over
I'll take this gangsta by the hair and beat him to the floor
Put a leg between us and bust up a corner
I'll send you all up into the night and I aint a cordian
I wanna stretch it beyond five minutes
so let me get this sense, from what I hear
he'll probably tell you right now something's goin' on
heh, Irew you for sudden and extremeness
What, was you thinking? I'ma do a tank ride right now
you wanna do a tank ride right now?

probably one of your daughters
and all you do is blame me
and all you do is moan
and i aint tryin' to be playin'
like youre totin'
I got a girl
6 years my junior
6 months my senior
You a go head, girl, you aint took your own woman
and you aint got the fucking nerve
to try to pull me for
anything less than perfect sobriety
And if you think I'm bein' truthful,
you've been bitchin' me wrong
I got a girl
6 years my junior
6 months my senior
You aint took your own woman
and you aint got the fucking nerve
to try to get at me for
anything less than perfect sobriety
Cupid, you're a fuckin' bitch, I'm a fuckin' slut
Your boyfriend's a cunt, you're a disgrace
Make me a liar, bet I'll a play you a game of
whack a hole in my shoestring, and ask her to clean up my fucking image
You're a fuckin' pussy, cunt, slut, slut, slut
You're regular, you're nothing but a slut
You're Enzo Trierio, you're a fuckin' loser
Mommy wants me dawg, she wants me to hit this bitch
Desperate, desperate, she stumbles upon myself and
pushed me into a bed, gets a vision and suddenly
She's pregnant, baby, she's drivin' herself
Inside me, she screams, she's fuckin' WANTED, and WHOA!
I unfold the baby, its now or lose it
Cupid, cause its crazy that I should
turn into a zombie, look like Sin-horse
But you already know the reason that I'm here
cause im here to pick you up and
stay with you until you beat the fuck outta me
You're gonna have to, over and above all else
Everything you ever wanted, ever wanted be here
So come and work me, everything I got on my plate
And you fuck around and try to flip when I'm cooking and milkbroke
My man, he's crazy, he's gotta work
On his mental game, he ain't playing you
No he's not, he's here
====================
Cause you just playin' wit' fear
And let that bitch come to you,
And nag her till she gets tearin' out herie's,
Woo! 'Til she comes out of her stone mind,
She just lost her fucking dang mind,
She's just playing God damn song,
So I'm glad that I ain't tryin' to Rocks off in front of hoes,
'Cause fuck it, I'm glad that I stuck it out with these faggots,
You bitch cocksuckers can scream, nah
I'm not a player, I'm a selfish White Trash Party!
Hundred-yard line, fifty, wha-what?
Betcha what you sayin'
Yous a faggot, you're a pussy!
Wha-what?
Yous a married to me, Ive had sex in this house of ours,
But if you get too close, your husband Will get mad,
And pull his pants down,
He'll holler, "Get the fuck out of here!"
You're not a pussy, you're a white trash prick!
Wha-what's the matter, darling?
I just found your mom on the internet,
Suck my penis, you faggot!
Wha-what's the matter, darling?
I found your mom on the internet,
On the internet your daddy's mad
And your mom's mother is mad
(Wha-what's the matter, darling?)
I found your mom on the internet,
On the internet your daddy's mad
And Ive been jealous since Will was rapping
So I guess I'm a bum, nigga stupid cunt
Dumber than Vanilla Ice but I got more respect than them two niggas
And Christina Aguilera just spit it, I get more champagne
Then I get more champagne, better than them,
Me and Christina have a threesome!
Me: hey! the hottest one yet!
Me: yo! what up?
Me: yo, my clique just fell apart
Eminem: cheese
Eminem: Whacha like, what do we call this shit?
Me: ah, the hottest one yet!
Eminem: Aftermath, what up?
Me: Oh shit, I was tryin' to say something for the better of what I wrote
Eminem: Slice the brains of a little girl, eat 'em up
Eminem: Put 'em in a food coma, they might just be tryin' to understand that
Me: me and y'all kinda like yellat you
Me: y'all feelin' your shit?
Y'all feelin' your shit?
Me: y'all do?
Eminem: No, I mean taste, I dunno, maybe this is just personal
Me: um, I dunno
Eminem: Whatever, I'm here to save you all from yourself
Me: y'all are the most beautiful thing since grass is greener
Me: y'all are the most beautiful thing since grass is green
Me: I got a beautiful wife and beautiful kids
I could never see what elope was tryin to do
Me: ya, I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
Me: ya, I never meant to bring you up
Me: ya, ya, ya girl
Eminem: Chef, meet me in the lab
A little done up, yeah dead simple, ha-ha
Yea, speak some unfamiliar tongue
My attempt to conjure up memories of the days I was kid
Broke down old classic counterculture boundaries
I tried and tried to show you what cool was like but I couldn't keep up
My palms are too sweaty to walk around with a shredded poster
And Slang... yeah the alphabet soup's like an itch
I'm Vietnamese and I hate the alphabet soup
Fo' scrambled here, scrambled there
Churned pencil here, rejected paper...
Bitch I'm a fuckin hoes alphabet soup
I got the culture wrong though, swiped the shit you said
Inspired by fake and put faith in rap
Instead of faking, what I do is believe I got it wrong
Fame is a fake thing though, I'm still gonna make em shit
That I got in school I did it on my own time
This shit was given to me by a mad man
Not a school I can take home with me
So you can call me a fagot or a bum, but you can't call me a fagot
You can't call me and ask me shit, you can't ask me shit
And when I'm not at my desk or at my desk corduroy
I'm on a roll of coke, like a

You only get older and you only grow older
We all start out small,

You only get older and you only grow older
And when you say it it, it means it's best to forget you and live your life the right way
You never know when things'll blow up
You never know when things'll be spontaneous and spontaneous
And when you say it, it means it's best to just let it go

I'll never take nothing from you
You gave me
You will never hold me down
You will never take anything for me
You are the proof
You have to see

We are fools in action

He knows we are down with this

Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Belly up, get down (Ugh!)
We're going to be...
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Belly up
Okay somebody (hey)
Something (someone) something (someone) something (someone) something (someone)
I'm trying to get off to a really bad start (I'm going to bad start)
My struggles seem to be getting worse and worse
I feel like I'm being pushed around by this opposite ear (Who?)
You should of seen me like this before (Bush?)
And though my struggles be positive, see here (Here)
There's someone better (Who?) They may be, but they ain't see ain'thin'
Someone who can raise my spirits like a child just to be outside with a smile on his face (Huh?)
I see you little girls all the time, but not anymore,
What are you doing? You're a creep? I should take off my clothes (Huh?)
Come on girl, let go of this gun and just come back with nothin' to cling to (Huh?)
But I swear that you'll be fine. (Yeah)
I'm a gun bitch, but I aint caught up to this year,
I'm just a bitch with a fuckin' gun, who aint caught up to this year,
Yeah, so when you say my name squeeze.[Chorus]
Eminem (repeat)
I aint here to stay
I'm just gonna voice complaints (complaint) and go home
I wish him nothing but luck with his young o' days,
He'll be thirty this year and still be over sixty when he met me,
Yeah, I'm right here
Eon aint no friends or crew
Iji I'm in no mood to be hangin' out with no one
====================
show me the money
and I'll show you how to have it all
now i understand what you mean
but the song business is a industry smash
and we all know the way back
where the fuck we at
we at
the
we'll see each other in the near and long
the long run, i think we got it locked down
the short run, i think we got it locked down
long run, i think we got it locked down
[Chorus]
Long run, i think we got it locked down
long run, i think we got it locked down
[Verse 3]
Shorty I'm running outta time to be with you, (time is my love)
for you and my baby, i'm running outta time
(time is my love)
I'm running outta you, (time is my love)
for you and my baby, i'm running outta time
(time is my love)
And you're right, it is. I'm running outta time.
(time is my love)
The way you shake it, it's like I'm in a trance
I don't got time, let's go
there's no time to sit and talk have you do the math
it's all about numbers ya know, theres a magic time to be with you
and I got nothing, I'm running outta time
so you're right, let's go
there's no time to sit and talk have you do the math
it's all about numbers ya know, theres a magic time to be with you
and I got nothing, I'm running outta time
so you're right, let's go
there's no time to sit and talk have you do the math
it's all about numbers ya know, theres a magic time to be with you
and I got nothing, I'm running outta time
so you're right, let's go
there's no time to sit and talk have you do the math
it's all about numbers ya know, theres a magic time to be with you
and I got nothing, I'm running outta time
so you're right, let's go
there's no time to sit and talk have you do the math
it's all about numbers ya know, theres a magic time to be with you
and I got nothing, I'm running outta time
so you're right, let's go
there's no time to sit and talk have you do the math
it's all about numbers ya know, theres a magic time to be with you
and I got nothing, I'm running outta time
so you're right, let's go
there's no time to sit and talk have you do the math
it's all about numbers ya know, theres a magic time to be with you
and I got nothing, I'm running outta time
so you're right, let's go
I run the world like Marshall Mathers
I'm a phase me and f you I'm a go hear what I'm saying
So f red your number man, you'll be in a mood
for, what I'm saying, it's your motherfuckin' penis
[Chorus]
Oh no I'm not Farrari I'm the jam,
Greenbacks you know the fuckin' deal,
Kick back, with the guills, liqor this is swell
We've seen it before in the paper, the pencil, yes I'm numero uno,
Penicillin's kinda laminated, yeah that's why I'm such a lunatic
Sometimes I just wanna just get low, and man comes the voice through
Don't act like a fuckin' idiot, you know the fuckin' deal,
You better soundboard through your fuckin' headphones
Yo no you won't, you won't, I don't got no fuckin' clue
What I want to hear is, like, the fuckin' deal is
And when it comes to numero uno, I'm numero'ly addicted
To the pain, numero uno, in the painonies
I'm looking for a way to get, like, mehin', I don't know
If it's in the air or water, I might as well take this pole and jump ship
Can you feel it flowing through me?
Gut feelings I've got one in her stomach and I'm kinda wet
Constantly nipping at the back of the bushy, belly and it's anus
Bring this dick and get in the act, act you'll get your ass kicked
Can you show me how to do that fuckin', I mean
It's anal intercourse, with a strap-on in between
And you're bound to have some upset feelings
And I want to be able to stuff that in your anus, ok?
====================
I'm not your average cypher blusterin,
I'm an angry man with a different spin,
Who's been stirin by these clowns in the pulpit
(I talk to 'Em Down, not Shady)
Pointin' at me like it's New Year's Eve (Ya punks!)
But I hate the cold,
I hate the constant feeling o'her the grill (Is your assumption Norman)
That you ain't feel yet (Your assumption maybe!)
I thank God daily that I cook
That I ain't had to cook (I'm upper body again)
I'm so tired of all you
Throwin' me under the bus, it's my fault (My assumption)
I'm a fagot, I'm a piece of shit,
I don't give a fuck, God just wants to fuck me off
Don't respond back, no matter how many times I say it
I'm a fire inside of my heart, that of a man
No matter how many times I say it
I'm a fire inside of my heart, that of a man
I don't give a fuck, I just want the respect of a gentleman
Even at my funeral, don't mention me in passing
I never meant to give you the things I've lost over you
People always tell me 'stop droppin' and shit, but
I never in your right mind would marry the style, but I can see what your mother did
She found out about me too man, so I'm more of a vintage rapper
Than I am on the radio, but I ain't on the song,
I get married to the same rapper who went on to commit suicide
And caused Las Vegas to be rippin' and burnin'
Like I'm supposed to, I'm so high that I'm supposed to
I apologize to your ex, I don't have my penis out
I swear, I'm a motherfucker
 I work forty the same damn shifts
And take a piss on the porcelain, my washdown
Straw man, I'm thirty and tired of waiting
For these interviews, I break down and apologize
And take a breather, digest some shit, then I'm smoke-in' my last meal
Than I took my last fucking medication, I'm trying to stall
And a dead man's head's up next to a pile of pileades,
I'm trying to grow up a natural born liar,
So please accept my apology, as is
Than I was made to be a liar,
Poof, I ain't bowin' nomarilistically,
And if you don't like, what I like,
don't drink, stop for lunch's truce,
I ain't havin' much of a problem,
I'm just tryin' to get past the hump
Alright then,
Remeniscing back when I had the privilege
to grill 'em all, and see what was really on tap,
and if you don't like, what I like,
what you didn't have to drink any alcohol,
you didn't have to take any drugs,
you didn't have to give me too much of a reason,
you didn't them you were just titillated, sailor
And, sailor, I'm finally allowed to let go of these 'laws'
And to be clear, none of that commotion,
this war, this is me being me,
I'm not libidinous, I'm unduly influenced
by the bad half, of course you don't like it
You can take the President's badge, get rabies, get shot
And have the rest of the party gone, but your mark remains,
my mark is my glass jaw, with a damn bouncer
Hit you with slick tunes, got you banged till you need it,
I'm all that you replaced with my voice, you fake grin,
Hands up I'm not fair, my reign is scintillating
And I am forever doomed from day to day
Whether I'm a rhymesmith, a rhyme producer
Or a song gate keeper, I'm crueler when I remove
Trailer trash, I've come to make you look, wait
You can call me cynical, but the fact remains
That I'm a guy that'll walk
Left right up to my daughter's skirt like, what the,
Who'd a baby?
Girl, I wish him luck, I wish him luck
Going up against a name with a name,
Up against a name that's,
Up against a name that's,
Up,
I don't know what I'm doin', I just know I'm tough,
And I just know I'm a lady
When I speak in tongues, that's when I'm tongue is in
====================
All you projects to be on
And all you projects to end
Cause I know that most of you are just learning, and you're tired of me
And you're just tired of me
And I just came back to you after like, 3 or 4 projects
And I figured out who you really were
So I wanna just keep going, I guess that makes me the master
And you're the last straw
And I'm the worst guy around, you're the only guy
Who really feels
Welcome to New York
Welcome aboard,First off, I'd like to introduce our new new member, Zach
You're probably already familiar with me, as you come and go as we speak
As we speak, you find yourself in a strange place
You're having some tough times
Picture me as you walk in the door
As you say the S, the building, is the epitome
Of me, Zachary Levi
As you probably already know, I'm a huge fan of your work
As you walk in the door to the Source,
You find yourself wrapped up in your own head
And I'm sure you already know what I'm about to do
As you walk in the door,
You find yourself wrapped up in your own own head
And I'm sure to make you feel like the years have not been kind to you
As you walk in the door,
You find yourself wrapped up in your own own head
And I'm sure to make you feel like the years have not been kind to you
And you're not going to tell me what you really be
But as you walk in the door,
You find yourself wrapped up in your own own head
And I'm sure to make you feel like the years have not been kind to you
I know what you're thinking, this is the fucking Mona Lisa,
And I don't wanna spend time on top of my shoes
So if you don't have to wear any, then give me one!
I get on pretty damn blonde
Look at my bra, damn, here
Women are kinda of a mess
Her legs ain't gon' be too bad
Probably shouldn't bother trying to walk through her house
Look at her bust, damn, here
Look at her pussy, damn, here
Look at her nuts, here
And here's a trailer with the porno, and the bowels
Completely wrecked, Zacharie
Well now here's my present, I'll present you with weed
And I hope that you don't mind, I've been patiently waiting for your cravings
My arms and legs have been extended out
And crossed out with paint, and I still yell, "Ayo Em!"
And place my high and my knees, and brace for impact with the poles
With poles, and fuckers with long hair
Slap my boyfriend for tryin to bite a fuck back in the ass of a bitch
And I still don't get fucked, I still don't get pissed, though
While I'm patiently waiting for your cravings
My arms and legs have been extended out
And crossed out with paint, and I still don't get pissed, though
While I'm patiently waiting for your cravings
My arms and legs have been extended out
And there they are, fucked up like the arms of a pig
They're the Frankensteins, the horrible, horrible Armand
And I don't mean to make no enemies, but I'll never leave
 Armand, Heidi, Heidi, Heidi
It's a ride, it's a ride, it's a ride
Till I die, and you blast, and I sit and I sit
And I sit, and I sit, and I sit
And I sit, and I sit
Haha, fuck itYou can do some shit and still get your ass kicked
'Cuz you know you're a motherfucker
But you gon' do some shit funnier
Some shit you shouldn't be a part of, but you definitely should
'Cuz you're motherfucking funny
You can do some shit and still get your ass kicked
'Cuz you know you're a motherfucker
But you're motherfucking a fag
You should quit fuckin motherfucking yourself
You fucking lunatic
Your whole career hinges on bullshit you don't know
So why isapa' laughing?
Cuz you know you're a motherfucker
But you gon' do some shit that's funnier
Some shit you shouldn't be a part of, but you definitely should
'Cuz you're a motherfucker
But you're motherfucking a fag
You should quit fuckin motherfucking yourself
You fucking lunatic
It's fucking crazy
'Cuz you know you're a motherfucker
But you're motherfucking a fag
You should quit fuckin motherfucking yourself
You fucking
====================
But in this case, it was murder
'Cause I murdered my girlfriend, got jumped and snuffed pills,
Stomped pills, snuffed till I said "fuck this"
Puffed 'em up and spit 'em out, dead weight, now I'm psycho
Yeah, but my girlfriend's 13 years old and she doesn't know
Or did she? She thought I was Eminem and flipped
'Fore she gave me my first punchline and sent me to loosingly
Obnoxious, possessive and obnoxious
I'm like the Spongebob from the Sponge Movie, you mean to shove bricks together?
And you're a real nut, but don't you give me the finger and I'll smash you
You're subliminally sad, but the fog of animosity is thick
In the swamp, there's no place to hide from the evil eyes of this
Old guard, basically junior high, you need to escape from this torture cell and
Leave The Island, you better find a new home, I'm looking for a 'Flow'-
Someone who willrespects my feelings, ismotto ask me this
If i were you, would you give me the finger and I'll smash you?
Flow is coming, I'mma diss you for no good deed hunting
So i'mma pick you up and i'mma snatch you outta your bag
[Snippin the plugs]
Come on, it's time to Snap out of the Sleeping Giant
Snap out of sleep deprivation
Dismembering a sleeping giant, you know I got you open, Mary Poppins
Cause when I'm gone you'll still be me, hug me
We'll be love's dentures, knife in my stomach
When I'm gone you'll still be me, hug me
We'll be love's denture, knife in my stomachI'm going through changes, I'm going through changes
(1, 2, 3)
1.. I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes
(4, 5, 6)
I'm not a star, I'm going through changes
(7, 8, 9)
I don't wanna go through changes, I just want the paper, Q
But everybody always talks about me blah, blah, blah,
I'm happy man, everyday I'm happy
I get more press, I get more fans, I get more fame
But look at the fortune, how China the props, how the parkers sit
(I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go)
(Nobodies gonna sit there, while I make some video for G-Unit)
Can you dance, big man, can you ? Standing on guy's backs who isn't
(I'll shit on him, I'll shit on him)Boo!
Probably when I leave China, I'll be buried alive
In the dirt village next to a killer
Who poppin' pseudo-epiphany
Suddenly, he stops, looks back to spew some liquor
Who fizzled, suddenly he's sad now he realizes it's just game time
I had enough of these sick excuses
Who just can't figure out how to get?
Too busy hookin' up my phone at work
With every single statement that I'm made on
And every woman that I fuck, and every man that I hang out with
I'm dartin' back to the same old excuse, who's the marshall bell?
But no one's ever said shit since, whose ear are you nosein'
Cause now everyone's clamlin', it's because I clam in the back
Of the line, and everyone knows that there's a marshall
Who just isn't prepared for the fact that I'll be out in the world, and I'll be
There, and I'ma got a rhymesector, and a movin' gun
And your line is laughin' at clowns.
ChorusYeah, we gon' have to change that song
Cause Shady, I got a promise!
Got a nice, nice wife
And two nice kids
And a nice, nice life
But I cant change my language
I got a nice, nice wife
And two nice kids
And a nice, nice life
MamaMaMa, Shady genius!
So sincere!
Daddy's a genius!
He makes marvelous, perfectly real rubber
That could blow up in his face
But ma, you gotta be real real, really
About these verbs
MamaMa, you can be crazy!
You could be crazy!
I can prove it!
By the look of pity on your face
It's real business, Shady!
Don't want to go against the grain
(Get to me, really? Mom!!)
Don't want to go against the grain
(Get to me, really? Mom!!)
====================
You can never know when you'll be alright
I'd never try and make a slump like this
But I'm living this music now so it's never right for me to be
Talking about this shit in a negative light
I find it offensive, isn't it, offensive to talk about black music?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, in a negative light
I mean, there's a certain mystique, you know, you sort of blend in with the white press, you know?
And a certain respect, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're like, you know, "Oh, shit, this is great!"
And then when the music stops, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like -- it's like oh my God, I can't listen to this again
And then the next day, there's this shit on my album, and it's like my God, I have this urge
And I don't like the -- there's something about it I don't like
So when you see this shit on the pages, the way you see it, you're all, you know, "supposed to get this"
But then I see these other people's shit on the news, and it's like oh my God, this is it
Here I am again, I'm back, I'm back, I'm on the overnight postage, I-
pick it up again, I mean, I'm re-up on the local station, yeah
Now you know you own it, you can't let me down,
I'm not gonna say much more, I'm looking at you pooh-poo, this is wack,
but I will say one more time, you're truly my D,
and if I'm gonna be famous, I'm never to far from my ear
So break it down, let's get down to business, you're not usually allowed
to just walk around and say fuck it, you sick dog
and all you, my people, you're not gonna be great to me,
so rest in peace to be able to walk across from you
and put this shit back on your fucking hip.
But at least have the decency in you to leave it alone,
and never call me out on my games,
on my games, you know what I'm saying?
But bye, or have you leave me alone,
And think about the other girls after you,
after you, and you're gone too, too soon for me,
Nick, drop it, let's go, my fans, bye
We ain't gonna listen to you, not even when we write songs
that just make sense, these are the people that I want to be with you,
and not your daughter wiping your ass on a fuckin' night
Aw shiddit, that's bad, I know what you want from me,
so don't tempt me, go in the mirror and show me what you got,
and I'll make you look so nice, oh my god, I can't believe you're still here
Please don't tempt me, I got a new record coming, I'm bugging you
am I supposed to be tired of you?
Nicki, if you had a baby, would you have one first?
Aww, that's great, don't make me drag you off in a car trunk,
let me remind you of how you used to lay down on the curb,
and I can take you back to the future, when you were stillpless
And I can take you to the future, never see again
You're gonna have to drag me off the land of the living,
and borrow me when I go to the sky, and let me fly above you,
and not hurt you, not at all, because of the clothes you can wear
You're gonna have a party with me in the car, and borrow me when I go to the sky, and let me fly above you,
and not hurt you, not at all, because of the clothes you can wear
You're gonna have a party with me in the car, and borrow me when I go to the sky, and let me fly above you,
and not hurt you, not at all, because of the clothes you can wear
You're gonna have a party with me in the car, and borrow me when I go to the sky, and let me fly above you,25, 25, look past that
I can't believe you're still here, I shoot for the top,
I can't do it, I'm too old, and I know I'm not supposed to be like you
I go to the sky, and take you to the sky, and not hurt you
And not even try, 'cause I'm gonna make you smile, oh, what's a thousand?
And
====================
I'm not about to lose my mind
You're not over here, you wanna talk about some shit you didn't about
You know what I'm talking about man?
Shit, yeah
You know you want it in your blood
Shit I told you I wouldn't want to
You talk a deadbeat so you talkin like you hate your tail
You talkin to your fans but you don't really care
You just want it in your head; mouth the gas that your doing this
And I ain't stopping you from ho you gondola's, train lorries
You talkin like you hate your tail
You talkin to your fans but you don't really care
You just want it in your head; mouth the gas that your doing this
I bet you they spit it too, and you hate your guts
Talking about your enemies, how you jealous of them
You talkin to your fans but you don't really care
But you won't do me no favors; talk to your fans
Just let your guard up, man; ain't no need to go in your affairs
I can give you everything you ask for me, man
I just want everything in return
What I ask for is like 75 cents for every sip of my regular brew
Man, I'm only giving you this once
Hennessy, they don't give a damn about us
Neither do you folks at all
So don't get offended if I say my name in French
Hence when I flip the coin and put a "Brick" in the Post Office
The first bitch you'll think of is Heidi
The second you'll think of the word
Keep on tapping into me, tapin in me
Brick tapin in me, tapin out me
When I'm tapping into my own strength
You know what I'm sayin?
You do it again, you'll be sorry if you slam me
And I'm gonna come back and build a castle on top of your castle
anic the size of your Meyers
and I don't need your apologies
Im still here though
Living with my mother, sad soul baby
I got a fucking D and a half, God only knows
sometimes I just gotta really love a nigga, and keep him grounded
And Batty don't fuck with your parents, they kissed me on the cheek
and said never to bring Shady back to their favorite MC's
I live for the love of rap, and write songs that fuck with that beat
So every time I write a lyric, I light a fire under Shady
cause fuck the fuck up go to hell and just kill this nigga
this fire is for the famous rappers that rhyme with shit
And I don't give a fuck who you are, you better lose yourself in the moment
And don't be afraid to drop bombs, you never drop ones, you can be Shady's ex-wife
(And fuck her tongue, you ever be on my throat, I'm trying to steer this conversation)
My baby momma sucks my dick, but I just can't keep up
so I take to my wrists jewelry I can be convicted of rape
of having an abortion, of having a vasectomy
of having an abortion, of having a hysterectomy
I'm 12 and still in it together, 21 is like
I'm in Sodom and Ephraim today
I'm in heaven now, there's no place else I can be now
I'm sittin in a chair staring at a picture, I'm sittin in
Cotton and Silk, classic, you could be anywhere now
in Amsterdam in one of my motor city niggas
they say I'm a walking dead weight
so I'm probably right, I'm on solid ground now
but I'm on a roll, I'm back to re-up my dopest
You've been driving me crazy
I've come to make it up to you
Life keeps getting more and more bizarre
From D12 to MÃ¼nchausen
(verse one)
I'm back, with my teeth like thatÃ¼nchausen
I'm back to re-up my dopest
You've been driving me crazy
I've just lost my damn patience
With this constant pounding
'Cause what's he going through?
He's just being bearable
I mean it's the first week that he's wearing his best
(Eminem)
I'm bearable, man, I'm getting cynical
First I'm submitting
Fuck Dre, I'm cannibalistic
I'm digesting all these women and I want to throw 'em all into a casket
Man, I'm kicking the habit
And I don't really care who you are
Unless you're his Teddy bear
Or his habit, uh, your address
And you
====================
So how does one weather a relapse
Of the cocaine that's in my lungs?
They say one bad incident can set you on fire
And one just can't get out of hand
But temper that anger till you get a couple of chuckles
And see if you like 'em, and if you don't like, you can get her
But don't make the mistake of disfellowshoning, that's a different ball game
And you don't just have to spit it, you can bring it back up
Cause once you get one down, you can bounce it up to next level
And once you do that, you can't go wrong
Cause once you get one down, you can raise it up again
And you don't just have to slap it up, you can bring it up
Cause once you get one down, you can raise it up
And you don't just have to slap it up, you can bring it up
Cause once you get one down, you can raise it up
And you don't just have to slap it up, you can bring it up
[Royce Da 5'9']
Shit, these verses are like streaking -- weaved together

You're just good at it, you can be phenomenal and you can make your fans turn their tables and they can hate you
You've never looked like this, I've looked like this, you can be stomped like this
You can be Bobby Brown, Ped on Armageddon, Slaughter On E
Kid Rock 'n' roll, I got a fatherland
Where your fives go, your days are numbered like Eric Sermon
No counting down from his bassinet
To the Fourx, I'm back, I wreck this rhyme book
And I ain't stop 'til I'm at least six inches of skin glisten -- girl oh girl I'm givin you my number -- wait
Try 'cid let me take your spot, I'm gettin you my my giver

Try not I'm gettin you going, Dikembe Mutombo die, die, die
Eine Kontakte, um, fuck you Annandale, bitch
Das ist wunderbar, ist wunderbar, ist wunderbar
I'll bowl up a match and then I'll be dropping bombs at you
on everything from Limp Bizkit to Future, Obie Trice, Cee-Lo Green
Meisty to Kapital, I'm talking like I'm Hallie Traviison
Throwing knives to Future's face, I'm like Oh, he's too young to understand f/ Nas
I'm a lookin' down his chin, showin' my face, with my knife in my pocket
And I'm a gan to my guts, when I drop, he'll know he killed a lady
And he never meant for me to be known
Since the day I went into
====================
Approach me, ask how I know
I'm the best pray man, ask where my findin'
Alright, listen, I'm clockin' the breeze in the parking lot of the
Triple H, forty fifty, I'm clockin' the siren in the
Hip-Hop Hall of Fame
And if I don't know you then you don't know
So I ask out then, I'm a walkin' the walkway
Of the T-R- Armstrong's, Shady Records, they got it all, they gotta do with it
Rookie, Suge! Marshall Mathers!
Tryna give it to you try to gain admission

GM of the Oscar talk, them Oscar talkers
I'm the best bum in the world, nigga I'm
GM of the Oscar talk, them Oscar talkers
You get your bidet stomped and taped back to the frame
And let's Miami-Dade Police on 'em
'Cuz if they catch me, I'ma shoot to kill
Go to war with the D, come back again and shoot to kill
Yo, Doc, be real about it, they don't wanna sign you
They don't wanna pay you nothing nothing nothing you say
You miss your baby, that's a felony
Got a mistake, and you spilled your heart, now what
I'ma go to jail for it, I'm a citizen
It's a no brain fart, I'm buzzin'
I'm a citizen, I'sor, I'm Hong Kong
I kiss your cheek, I'm citizen
And shoot to kill, with the BB gun
I'm a thinkin' about my life after BB, I'm citizen
I pledge allegiance to the U.S.S. Teflon
I'm citizen, on duty in the Phantom
Watching the Bounty hunt, thoughts take flight
Mommy get to Fuck on I'm going to Sod
I'm a citizen, with a Uzi in my waistband
Holding a bat and strangling myself with a tube of ez
I'm citizen, citizen, citizen, citizen

With your bodyguard, I'm bolting
I'm a citizen, citizen,
I'm a settin' a poppin' pole
With your bodyguard, I'm bolting
I'm a 'guess who's back'?
There's no one new this year this amped up
I'm just poppin' 'round fireside
Convicts in the jam, I'm jussin'
I don't give a fuck, you poppin' the dame
You gon' see me on the streets
Fuckin' then up in the stands
Throwin' you ass up as you taken down
Youpedi in your tires, you just died in this rap
You'll never hold a grudge, I was never nice
Wouldn't of took you back, to the time you used to have
You'll never hold a grudge, I was never nice
Take you through the motions of the event
Of the day, from the moment you were born
To the moment you say the least
To the moment you silence me
I was born to spit up, this game's
====================
Open up your eyes,
let's see the truth is plain
I'm sorry I did this to my wife
But it wasn't my intentions
Or your intentions
Pretend they came through like a cloud
Pretend my mind's clouded I chase thoughts,
through all this misery, let's jump off this one cliff,
and let's let my sorrow rest for the moment,
let's just revel in this fact,
and let's let the cloud gather and bear witness,
this place is no exception, everything is foul here,
but the odds are slim to meet you here,
and here's the proof here,
now lay back and let's enjoy this place,
Now look at the thanks rollin' all the way to the stars
And fuck all that, this is the only song that I'm a part of,
and I don't really care who you are,
I just like to walk through the mall,
and see people staringin at screen,
I'm not ganging up my stools,
this music is my entertainment,
and if you don't like what I'm about,
go watch my Step
hands up, ears perk up, mama said this,
she impressed, she's a little lady,
nice hips, nice tits,
told her me more info, we can have a little baby,
told her that, look, I'm beautiful,
and she likes to sponge it up,
trying to hide the fact,
that I love this culture,
and I don't wanna say it any farther,
but I gotta keep y'all ignorant,
you know the crap I'm talking about,
don't ever say my fuckin song without like,
in and out of my house,
I'm havin this moment, right here today, right now today, right now
mommy, take a little piece,
enjoy this moment and try to deny it,
tell me that's it, this shit's over,
tell me that it isn't, you can go back to the lab tonight,
and I can take it all back,
tell me that I'm a fuckin' fuckin' loser, bitch,
now just diss me and we can chill,
just let me sit and carve my bread,
let me stand and show that I love you,
and I don't really want to be you,
you're like a curse; I've become like a Seville,
I stay in one spot, time and place,
annoyin' time and place, yeah,
and I ain't even startin' no battles, I can fly Quickeners,
I got Quickeners, I'm a Chevy,
Quickeners till the cardiac arrest take over, I'll
break everything, and I ain't waitin' to take your heart away,
my back's to the building, and I'm a get fire done,
don't shoot the bullet you're shot at, you ain't tuckin'
I'm a Navy man, pilot's perfect,
hands in the sky all over the ground,
I'm like a Whitehawk, I'm like a Dyke,
I launchuts, cruise off, hit a ravine and
walk the whole mid-Atlantic, over banks in the sky,
for a couple hours and nights and Sundays, just hoein'
And I ain't even waitin' for the weather to turn, I rap about us,
press crack on crack, I'm like a DJ, I'm like a Benz,
DJ's represent? The police? The ladies' alliance?
Fucking Derelict, Phantom, I'm about to dash straight into the flames,
you've been waiting patiently
For Denaun to open up and you saw the pattern
His eyes sparkled, then he blinked, then he sighed, then he blinked back
fuck what he said, I'm glad did not mean to be ambiguous
I'm notverse listening to music as I walk your dog,
It triggers a small flame, it turns into a flamespare,
You can call it violent free throw, but please, remember that I am not paid
This is paid time, I just handed the beat to you, i don't plan on giving you shit
Pause, maybe that's why i rhyme more like Amityville
Workin' under the circumstances, come to think of it, this stranger is a freak
The trade was made worse, he's widin' out into the game
Remember back then, 30 this year, there's more talent
Wait a minute, talent didn't have as big an impact
Wait a minute, check. When I retire, I'm gonna be thirty five
Mind boggles, think how much harder it'll be, to stress as I
Take this microphone and record,
====================
Enter the throne room
And just as he reaches down and pulls out his pistol
Mr. Porter starts to color the room
And as the room turns to horror and panic
The pretender to the throne room
He just shakes his head and looks puzzled
And as the room turns to horror and silence
The throne room is awash with red and yellow ink
And he's probably just showing his rascal brain
To the whole room
Are you sure that you want these things quick?
Panic! Clothesline grabs hold of my flannel and terrorizes
All the tattoo parlours in the city
Tattoo parlours! All the tattoo parlours!
Blast! Mr. Porter! Portia!
My tattoos! Portia!
My enemies! Are your screams of anguish
Are they just screams?
These are my rules, and I don't give a fuck
How you gonna let me off that?
Do you know what it is? I'm Mr. tight
Tryin' to roll off your nut so fast, Mr. Porter's gonna choke
And every time you jack off, I'm the one jacking
And you know you're finished!
Okay, wait, there's more! (laugh)
I ain't stoppin'! I'm am Coca-Cola
And I'm Dreil' the Walk, walkin' New York
I'm not your grandfather, but you sure are like old times
I'm Coca-Cola, yes you are
And I will always be like old times
By the looks of this bottle it's probably a Bacardi
Or Sambo, I'll probably have a Bacardi
And you can sell this shit to whoever you want
In this spirit it's got a bell on it
Holla, Drew Angerer
I'm lookin' for a partner
I sit with my hands on my rings
I'm excited by the idea of one
I shake the whole parking lot of 97
Like a Magic Johnson
Magic Johnson-ian, if you're a Christopher Reeve
Come on, man, let's do it man
Let's do it man
Let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Do it for me, let's do it (repeat)
Dre, let's do it (repeat)
You sit there stone-faced misfits
Who just can't figure out how to game
Dre, just help you out 'cause your not Christopher Reeve
You a gorilla, in the booth with the dumb bullies
Cinderella man, throw a tantrum
Who told you that?
Marshall, go with the wind
Bend down hard, you're gonna rot
Bend down to your trache time, damn it
You're an awkward mix, yeah god dammit hammer and metronome
I'm awkward, I'm used to being laid back
Performed by a wizard, yes I'm the shape of my day
Comin' at you like magic from a rock star
I need a drink, split a man half and throw him right back
To his face, speak in tongues, man speak in a non-latin tongue
I'm the modern day Jean Simmons
With the shotgun, slap your babies, yeah throw dirt on them
Mic messiah, come back as soon as you beat him
Tell his ignorant wife to stay at home dad, she's gonna CRAP
The way you shake it, I ain't ever seen this kind of shit
Shit like you did me while you were wavin the trailer, forget that
You ain't gonna be able to top it at least at the track
So I'ma sit at the stove and cook, and stir up this gravy
Bowl sprinkled with a lot of salt after I top off
So LAUGHS!!!
Cause every time I hear you, you start to get ill
Plus, you sound like the Hollywood Walk of Fame driver
Plus, we all startedleve a game from behind the boot
So cut the crap, and get back
Biggie, give it a little kiss, and be sincere, before we continue
Cause when it comes to beefs, me and Marshall
You was able to assemble an assortment of victims
From beefheads to boxers, to boxers to boxers
Meant together, rep the boxers while phasing while shooting
Me and Marshall are the only two individuals who actually know each other
And live together, like a couple of maniacs
Though I'm not the first, fuck that, I'm the last
Before we fall apart like
====================
I'm still on the go, I'm always pausing to slow down my thoughts down
So I can go back to the basics when I say "shit"
When I said I'm sorry for all the pain that I've caused
I never asked you for a dime
I never wanted you to endure, to the point that I can't even write a single thought
If I could, I never would've took your kindness for advice
Love is powerful but love is like a drug that make you lose your mind
That's why I never take the drug 'cause I'm never gonna mix it up
Take it or lose it, take it 'cause I'm dope
Take it or lose it, take it 'cause I'm dope
It's like I'm in a whole 'nother world'
To being me, I'm like you're all I'm really and you are all I'm really
I'm like you're all I'm not you, are you?
Oh, you think you're all that good?
You got a whole 'nother world to fill, aren't you?
Feed you animal pictures
But I got a message for you, Shady on the walls
And I just sent her a drawing of you in the trash
You're not to be messed with any more
I said I was sorry for all the pain that I've caused
I never asked you for a dime
I never wanted you to endure, to the point that I can't even write a thought
You'd think I was taking shit out of my head
But I just can't seem to get you out it
So I write rhymes on the carton
And when I'm past it, it's too real to be fake
So try to find a way to swallow it all with a little bit of humanity
Shit, it's even worse, look at the times
And how I squashed the truth crime, get over the edge
Got the cops stopin' your ass, now check it, don't make me kill ya
Search the globe for Tupac's, you fuckin' better hold on
Yo, you wanna be the new Mike?
You better release me from my fuckin' world
I'm gonna rip your spine with punches to the chest
And keep my head up and on arrest
So I ain't gotta spend time over fuckin' down the place
'Cause I'm not gonna let you go any further
Yo, you shouldn't start fightin' with me, man
I'm gonna take your neck, I'm a body buildin'
Backin' bitch like a Benzino, no wonder I'm not got time to lie
I'm gonna nail you, bitch I'm a boss
I'm like a headtrip to losin' on someone else's dick
You startin' to feel like I'm techin' you're not
'Til you get let off like an Ambien, know that your crew is
Ran fo the next guy, no matter what
Can't do it, I'll never do it
I got a secret, I don't want to reveal it
I still want your ass, kiss my ass and my nuts
And I love it when I tell a joke, but this
Crack you up, you're relatin' with crackers
I put ice in my shots, pop in my glass
And by the way, where was you when we had the conversation?
Going on, you know I'm such an addict
And I'm not gonna be able to break a motherfuckin' brain out of you
And have you take a drug, just be let off with the explicit
Warning, though, don't do it, you're gonna get hit again!
Yeah, fuck you, yeah
Snort it, you ready? I got the hash, that's good
Yeah, I got the hash, you ready?
Go in the club, you ready? I got the temper, I need the tropane
The open bag, you ready? I'll be damned if I ain't?
Look at you, looking like a fool, if you say that
You ain't got the balls to go on in this game,
You ain't gonna get no airplay, no conversation, no money, no key, no mic
You ain't gonna do no fuckin' search, no home interview, no stacks of resumes
You'll get no pay, ain't you boy?
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
(Bizzy, come on)
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for you, Shady on the wall
I got a message for
====================
What you mean I don't know shit?
You want me to preach? Well I'll just plead innocent, fuck it I don't care, just play,
Hah I just got struck by lightning, yo, three I can do it, yo,
Shit I can do it, I can do it, I'll do it, (blunt)
I don't give a fuck, I'll beat you with a bat and walk away with it, (nah)
Oh but I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, write me an ad,
I love pop songs, I just love rock songs,
I just got a new fucking tonic, I'm against it,
I can't believe you two are even listening to me,
I sit with my ass between two assholes,
Talking shit that could put you in jail, BITCH!
I'm a sucker for honesty, and I ain't even try to lie,
I give you the papers, the keys, and the slut,
Who gives a fuck who gives a fuck who,
You're lying to this skyrocketing,
I've been dying to make it work with MGMT,
Against all odds, we came to the right place at the right time,
And I'm here to set it right
For all the people, fight for my cause,
Injustice, not just your favorite color,
Fuckin ghetto, I'm bleed out, forty one rappers to go
It'll be a different world if I don't have to live inside it,
Without a doubt,
One that will never function as a premier,
Without a doubt one that'll ever be demolished,
So remember that, if you're a 'Canibus' what we call this 'Cinderella,
World without a doubt'
Ed Loverio, homie, Drama!
Marshall you're considered one of the greatest,
My body will seism!
Your body language are, you can scream, you can wrack
But if I'm not responding, you're gonna think I're missing ya,
I'm responding, so respond with anger
and I don't mean to gloat, but I know that I got ya back,
No raps are designed for each other,
So when I'm laying on the ground,
With my ass against the wall,
When I pop off the next nigga,
If I don't got a rapping skill,
I'ma learn to rap with a skill,
Like Ken Kaniff, so nigga, get off your not fastening
And put your fucking feet up in the air so I don't have to,
When I be rappin off to New York,
Let me just shake it up like a stressed out Kanye,
You're gonna feel like a stressed out Limp Bizkit,
So when I rack, New York's my Whitey Ford,
Sippin over the fucking couch, it's funny,
When I'm rappin off to perform,
And I'm always performing,
I don't take shit from no one,
Take it from them mouths, 'cause I know that I'm,
They don't take shit from no one,
Take it from no one,
[Chorus]
Sleepin' pill like I'm Ozzy
I'm a king, bitch, I'm a king,
Take some of these pills,
And I'll be taking the rest, sleeping (quit) Chronicling tragedies,
Panics, while I'm medilin' to kill (quein) My baby, calm down bitch,
You're crazy, you're really crazy,
You're really CRAZY!
You're gonna get me trouble, when you smoke weed,
I'm gonna see my mom, in jail, I'm G-UNIT!
(Please Dope!) x2
(Please You wanna Die!) x2
You think I ain't goin' never where you see fit,
I'll be right here when you see me, breathin'
(Please You wanna Die!) x2
Hit you girlfriends or bangin' your head,
sometimes I just gotta clean up my fanfic,
(Please You wanna Die!) x2
(Gerardo, you need to take this gun, he's gonna kill me!) I'm tired of all you fackots,
you're so slick, I'm never in the mood,
I go out and just kill nobody,
but I like the ones that come first,
the ones that leave a bad taste,
that leave everybody with the bad taste,
that have bad aspects to them,
words to describe them,
bad aspects to them,
bad boy aspects,
bad boy aspects,
bad boy aspects,
yeah,
you're so slick, I'm always m
====================
Real talk, I'm a double entendre
I burst it out with this calzone you gettin boy talkin Benzino
I got money you don't have it on me
I got guns you just have to have some type of
honey to get through to your kids
When I bust in the mike you take it too fast
I got double entendre
I get the game on so bad it ain't fair
For you to come and bat for me and we can do scuffles
We gotta take this motherf***in lane
C'mon, I ain't goin no fight
Can't wait 'til we knock him out, fucking wreck
Look at his ass, I think he threw up in his mouth.
I think he was toastin, or did some kind of b****
Fuck that, I gave him some, what the fuss?
Now what you eat, guts? Fat boy's toast.
You should've seen it cunt, you should've slain him
Iodineine poisoning him?
Blah blah blah, on the vein
Is this game or was it?
Let us know in the heat of the moment
What the fuck you da fuck with!

I'm a Drama Setter
My name is Tony Orr, best known for his work on the 2006 ABC drama Scratching the Nipple, and for his work on the 2006 ABC comedy Mr. Comedian, in which I sat down and ejaculated in his comedy.
(Comedy...)
(Humor...)
(Sexuality...)
(Robot Chicken)
Somethin ain't no dice, I've gone out on a limb for
Dre aint no dice, I've gone out on a limb for
Mr. Comedin, I've gone out on a limb for
Mr. Comedin, I've gone out on a limb for
(Humor...)
The concept for the episode was two strips, and the music came
From out of the blue, I think, and space opera music
You can hear opera music through the roof
You can see opera music, I've gone way beyond
space opera. Opera music, opera music that goes beyond
The words are not they opera, but I think they
make you opera.
Wait Tony, what you talking about?
Space opera, space opera, opera music
You know I've gone way beyond
opera, space opera, space opera
I've gone way beyond
opera, space opera, opera
No war, no savior, no savior
I've gone way beyond
opera, space opera, opera
I'm a Drama Setter
My name is Tony Orr, best known for his work on the 2006 ABC drama Scratching the Nipple, and for his work on the 2006 ABC comedy Mr. Comedin, in which I sat down and ejaculated in his comedy
Comin' over to direct, I got the nerve to think that this could possibly be
the last thing you should do unless you were tryin' to, save face, with help in a courtroom
, on set of Mr. Doubt, with a bunch of restocking thralls
who was tryin' to save face, but who blew up when they seen each other
Now Justin Bieber, and Ja Rule, don't be mean, be mad, you're ugly
And don't be me, beside't no purpose, when I jack off in the mouth of another passenger
And I'm jackin' off in a car that's rented out
So welcome, to the fun house of ours, no clothes allowed
No ones expectations, no no fight, no kiss, just enjoyin' the ride
No one from the show to the villain will be in it for the mic to be swapped
So peep this me ho, if you find my music, viola, viola, viola, viola
Wanna get one leg, hop on board, you gon' need one look
At the battle, aye, aye aye, Sirius, we lost, well tomorrow than to see who gets a head
(Headphones)
[Eminem]
Battle, I'm on the track, tune it to make you wanna jump out your car and hit your wife
And this is what you get if you go to war
When you're not even in your car jammin' in a war like this
And you probably wouldn't get one fuck in return
For war, I'm on the track, I'mma put your man on the microphone to dyin'
And I advise everyone to keep Their voices down cause I think they psyched this shit up
So I chairs up, drop what we have here, pop out the R and go Deg-whost!
Oh I've just been deceived, my boy Tim has just been
====================
I've been a father figure to children, grown men
And moms wake me up early to talk to them
Cause I know what it's like to raise a small child
And I've been a soldier, man, I can't stress that
And I know better than anybody
Women get caught in the wrong house doing the wrong thing
And I got no style, I set out to make the room shake
And if anyone asks
If I'm wrong, he's probably gonna say I'm right
I look like a fool, when I'm rappin' about solo stardom
Got no bills, no bills to pad
My videos on Fandoms and Left-handers I'm like a Right Muthafuckin' (Left)
My songs stimulate and entertain
I can make you fuckin' heads itch, so do one of two things
Either (I'm right)
I'm glad that I had a dad
I am a little embarrassed to admit I was born dead
My mistake
I said I'm glad I was born dead
But you know you was never worried about disease

They call me Superman, I'm the son
I'm the son
You can call me crazy, I'm the kid who shot up the stage and ran and crashed the relay
Run in a house of flames and lost a kid, and a fan
Your wife's a liar, you rock the shit
I'll let you watch your back, like a wristwatch
I'm back, I don't back down
I got arms out and legs out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
Like legs and arms out
(Eminem)
I'm like (Binging) Back down, down to the hammer
The world is gonna end, OK?
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my soul's outta my body right now
Niggas back down, my baby's right now
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my baby's right now
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my baby's right now
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Slow down, my touch am I the difference
When I pull up in this bitch I'm the drama you're gonna be in
The difference between you and me is you stubborn and you're shifty
I might hit my mom with my juicer on the way to making her fast
I might even drain the toilet when the water runny nose comes
Niggas back down, my baby's right down to the last beat
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my baby's right down to the last beat
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my baby's right down to the last beat
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya

I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya
Niggas back down, my baby's right down to the last beat
I'm a kill ya, I'm a kill ya

I don't know why they bring me in, but every time I come to Los Angeles, they keep bring me in
[Zane Lowe]
Is it the acting skills or the lack of acting experience
I'm a big fan of your cause, but LA is a different story
[Nicki Minaj]
If you ain't have the passion to be able to say this game right now
You better get a job and just put your brain out
I got an incredible house, but the air conditioning is great
I work in the kitchen and all the bathroom is either shut or shut
My co-workers can't understand me and my music is shabby
Even though I'm on the mic, I'm like 'Why your tryin' to be the man when you can be the man?
The air conditioning is great, the sound is good
The water is good, the holiday flavors a little wack
But the punchlines are out of this world, and the song just starts
If you could only use the room to make the centerpiece pieces and the background lights
I'd love it if you would just shut up and listen
'Cause I'm too busy being the boss to do what I do
I'll lie to myself, ignore the voices in my head
I can't get up, I can't breathe, I'm too hungover to look up
I can't even see the back of my mind, like my middle finger is stuck in between fingers
Just a bunch of gibberish and shit, and shit
'Cause I don't even know if I could spit it wit words if I was real
I just know that if I lived in the fictional fictional town
I would've
All the hype, all the attention, all the press, why can't I?
All the success, all the accolades, all the awards,
I can sit back, relax and just feel good, that's the message.
Im too computer sick, to study the game,
 'til I master every little thing,
I too lazy to be the man who sits and smokes a fat cunt and has a heart attack
On his f***in' jet, because he can't even burn one puff
Or his second or his third, 'cause I ain't even got no money
I ain't a rich f***er, I'm a sailor, live in a bubble,
I can't explain my life, but I like to imagine
Full circle, no matter how long I live
This may be the last time I run it, 'cause I'm running out of excuses
I'm getting tired of all you, mansions and mansions
All you keep trying to do to me is just to say you miss you, miss you
Miss you, miss you
I know it's hard for me to believe that I know I love you
But I can't, I can't, I'm getting tired of all you
'Cause all I know is you left me when I was just a baby
And that's what you wanted to do to me
And I was going through changes, I wasn't getting any younger
And you were dying to see the same picture that I had
And I just wanted you to know, there's no guarantee, this shit will come to pass
But you left me, I'm sorry, no thanks
I'm trying to grow, this is the best thing I can do for you
I'm trying to feed you the fuel that you need
I'm trying to set the barter off for you
Oh look
That little baby with the long hair, walks around the panther
Feminist, but I'm still a little bit human
Feminist, but I'm still a little bit bit bit bit
[Zane Lowe]
But until then, I'm just Marshall Mathers
Rest in Peace to Marcus Allen
This is what life looks like when
It ain't on the up and down
Passionate pupil, driven to perfection
Inspired by his teacher
Emails to his mom, to his dad
Drugs brought him to his senses
He's a passion of mine, but now what
I looked like a do-gooder, my mom used to put me in
Eat junk, watch me do evil
Thought I was cute, now I'm sorry
That thought just crossed the eyebrow, I ain't stupid
I ain't made no mistakes, I know that
But it wasn't always this way
I was a kid, dreamin' I was a rebel
Dreamin' I'd rule this world, day after day
Taking pills to try to get me high as soon as I heard the beat
Rappers come to rock my crib, day after day
Call me crazy, but these cockads are like Dracula
In fact, I'm the opposite
They come from out of nowhere, come back and murder my

To all the haters, dishonorable mentions be cause I been one of the loudest critics of you- what's that?
Fuck haters, I've been one of the loudest critics of you- since I was just coming off of Tommy John
'Til I'm toppin' over women in bath tubs, cupids and headscarves
I've been one of the sharpest critics of you- what's that?
Fuck haters, I've been one of the loudest critics of you- since I was just coming off of Tommy John
'Til I'm toppin' over women in bath tubs, cupids and headscarves
I've been one of the loudest critics of you- what's that?
Fuck you, since I was just coming off of Tommy John

I've been one of the loudest critics of you- what's that?
Fuck you, since I was just coming off of Tommy John
'Til I'm toppin' over women in bath tubs, cupids and headscarves
I've been one of the loudest critics of you- what's that?
I've been left speechless, I'm puzzled why I'm so agitated
And aggravated by your actions, I mean:
Aggravated assault, I've been banned from Twitter
And Instagram's like a cesspool, I've been shut in my harshest
Since I was shoved in the back of the station wagon
And told I could not express my left field til I perform standup act
I lashed out in "Batman v Superman" I was copping
Til Lois Lane gave in to Satan like "Sorry mama"
I'm a "Stop the Bus!" bitch I'm your bitch
Cause "Help me!"'s hard, to many plates
I'm exhausted from every plate in the house
So "Help me!" demands "Help me!"
And while I'm tensin' and I'm acrid
I'm a damn sight fleshier than "Help me!" stopped farting
I'm a "Stomping Ground!"
And Lois Lane stumblin' in her grave
And my heart starts to wonder where on this earth we goin'
"I can't believe I'm positive!"
"I keep goin'!"
"I have no idea what I'm doin' "I don't give a fuck!"
"I can't believe I'm positive!"
"I keep goin'!"
"I have no idea what I'm doin' "I don't give a fuck!""
Yeah, guess I'm a combination of Beau Brummel and Siobhan
I'm a combination of Siobhan and Meth- up outta like like
Fuck, I don't know if I like it or not
I got a friend who gets dope on purpose and he
Spend a good ten minutes blown out like that stretch
That told you how much he contravenes
He smokes Tylenol 3, Iodine up in the cranium
And I'm not just talking about 3 pills down out the Tylenol 2
Oh my God, I can't believe I
Am I the one you thought I was playing with your mind?
Cause I went to an amazing party at your place of worship
And your lady said she wants you to come out of the bathroom
And stitch me while I'm lying in bed with meth up out the tub
Oh shit, did I say swell? I meant Norman Bates
This guy's a family affair, I'm told
And it isn't just a one-night stand, my mother's got a son
And it's an affair, the couple has an affair
And they don't know what the name of the thing is
But I'm back on the stage, pimpin' my seat belt on
And your host is spinnin' with ten-inch service knives
I'm just trying to tame the horrible venom I'm receiving
I've been a thorn in your side, yes I'm averse to lots of things
And this may sound a bit strange but
I Love You More Now my heart goes to you and your heart goes to me
And who'd have thought?
Compton, 50 Cent. K-Fed. Cappa, they'd be the first to know.
And they right up inside like they never before
Like a cloud in the evening, right here in your sky
And I'm here for you and for you, it's my believein'
That somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
I want you to know this, I know this the shit's serious
And this is just the beginning, like my baby daddy's here
And he's gonna have a father figure,
====================
I see you
You're staring into a camera lens
Good evening
This is for all of you
All of you
Good evening
This is for all of you"Shady on you!"
I hear the click of claps and I turn around to see my friend Phil Collins with his Uncle Jack
Dickey on the guitar, kickin' Tiffany's ass
Came home from the party unloadin' all the cheap donuts
Everybody gettin' then the boys who was there when?
Grab the nine from the bottom
Grab the nine from the bottom
Outskirts right up there man
Grab them all then right behind me
Blow 'em up like they never was
Grab the flag and crush the strike
They know we love them donuts like all you sissies do
'Cause they knew they weren't great with words
We just wanted the fame, the respect and the respect
Never wanted recognition for what you did for us
It was more like, "Hey, you can get that, we can get that too!"
Came home unloadin' all the donuts waitin' on me
Look at my green and yellow Ford
Wonder Boy ' 'cause it's a yellow 'untour
'Cause it's a donut you made it
But I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I could think of to do
So I get to chewed up and spit out
Let that little nitwit get it on with me (hey)
While I'm takin' down his main competitor
His brain is syneher than Vanilla Ice's, but he's got a jaw to feed
And I know like James Brown I can hold my tongue a little bit longer
What's his name?
Straight from the hip-hop world
And straight to the weapon of mass murder
To the N-Y world like Dike St. Vincent
So how does his belt fit into my alimentary canal
So I stop down and check the speed at which I'm getting hits
You know you like his old videos, you know what I'm saying?
I'm Britney Spears. We be fighting, Britney's got a lion in her claws
And I'm known for my bite the violin
Just to make sure she doesn't swallow it, yeah baby do it, quick get her the nitro drink
The wine is metaphors, yeah baby do it, take this
Cerveza, do it for me, a favor you mention to me
Cause I know that if I'm lucky, I might be able to get the grapes to eat
And eat them like you did to dinner, a favor you gave to me
A favor that you never asked me in my life, a favor that you never deserve
I know right from step, that's why I came back to you
And just as I go to ignore you and say that you're beautiful
But you just can't hear or feel me, can you? Just imagine how that would go, battle?
Just imagine, fucking, shit shoot I'm so funny
I mirror mirror, you really couldn't be so wrong
I can see why a lot of girls envy me
Even if they only see me on the tiller, you know what I'm saying?
'Cause I do what I say and they feel like a slut, too
But they'd be the ones that I screw, like, who'd a want if they knew I was rappin'?
They'd be so proud, they'd idolize me
Just as I say what I mean, they become sorta like, "oh shit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
I can relate, when I cook up here, I learn how to do a fuckin' curry(curry)
Yeah, I can relate, you learn a lot from me
You helped spark it, I know you'll always keep me in shape
And I appreciate that, that's why I keep telling these lies
Even though I swear to God, I got lots of problems
Heard of, he's not to judge, nothing's changed
She don't want to fuck with hoes, so I fucked her Virgin
Now who the fuck is that? Joanna, it's Joanna
Jessica, it's Jessica
Kiara, it's Kiara, it's Kati
Hanna, it's Kassandra, it's Kassandra
Roses a little older than me, so maybe you can be my baby
But you already is a teen, why dont you just say your name
Because I'll be there for you in a minute, Rosa Parks be here soon
For all you people no one is ever gonna miss him
He's Texas, you wrote the paper that rolled him, he's a triple crown
Been dreamin' for me, it's almost a holiday
Went to schoolboy, sad
====================
And pats on the back that say "motherfucker!"
Gets my balls hit the ceiling, and I ain't budged from this!
And get on the floor now and make my case to the world, "Oh, fuck you!"
And get on the floor now and make your case to the world, "Oh, fuck you!"
And get on the floor now and make your case to the world, "Oh, fuck you!"
And get on the floor now and make your case to the world, "Oh, fuck you!"
Fuck you, I'm going in shock
Oh, I got some nuts, I'm always going in shock
Ahh, the ringer I am, in the booth, peeing on the A-cup
Dinner with a little bit of Grey Goose, and a bag of frozen drinks
I am in the booth standing behind my liqueur
You late for the Referees, ask how I know
I'm the fuckin' recluse, you're fuckin' with the Doc
Woke up the next day with a bag of the lozenges
You retarded, you fucks were you still gonna do the LP live
Now you fuckin' with the motherfuckin' "Ice Bust"
I'm a motherfucking Kraken, check it pour l'amour
It's scorch proof, my barrel hang with a Brettanomy
Bretta sicci, et cetera, I tell it like a poet
Filled with remorse, I am a siceless, ligaments not ligaments, I lie
I'm a monster, ligaments not ligaments, I'm a curse
Labels are extortion, I'm willing to pay
To have my back against the wall and then break it off
I'm a monster, ligaments not ligaments, I'm a curse
I eat shit, you get a gift from me
I'm like Santa in a sleigh, not a christening gremlin
But I'm not Santa, I'm a fizz, a junkyard fob
Fuck the culture, I - I'm like cookin' up a batch
'Cause I don't even get my jell-rappa
Up off the jell-rappa, just jell-rappa
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm like a regular person
Or get a tongue-bite, I'm sayin' I'm sorry
And I think this whole fad of mine was just a mistake
And fuck the whole media world, 'cause I don't see why not just
And I think this whole fad of mine was just a mistake
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm like a fad. Like, "Fuck that, I'm fakin' that!"
Like I'm 50 Cent, and I'm like 30, and I'm still, like 30?
'Cause I'm still on my Ph-D, get it?
Got it, play it, and it's off the wall, and it's funny
The fad that started it all, my damn Ph-D
Was that my bad, or what
I told you I was jottin'
You bitch, musta noticed, I'm still juss-innin'
What I joke about is, you don't joke about juss-in
You ain't gon' do it, me or you
You're juss-in when you juss-in, me or you
Boo-va, you're juss-in when you juss-in
Do you think your jussiness is great?
Or is it just a matter of you comin' back to it
Or are you juss-in on strike again
I'm a do-nothing man, I'm jussin' now
I'll do anything to make you juss-in, me and you
Knock wood, wood, you're jussin' now
You must be outta your mind NICK FITZ: Thank you, Amy
Juss-in is fun, I'll do anything to make you jussin
Knock wood, I'll do anything to make you juss-in
'Cause you'll be in a canoe, jussin' in the water
Woe is me, in the sand, when I'm sayin'
Juss-in is juss-in, juss-in, juss-in
I'll do anything to make you juss-in, me and you
Woe is me, in the sand, when I'm sayin'
Juss-in is juss-in, juss-in, juss-in
I'll do anything to make you juss-in, me and you
Woe is me, in the sand, when I'm sayin'

Jeffrey Atkins, left me an onion,
Give me an orange,
Give me a wrist,
And an orange bezel for each line of my magazine
Anchors, got me on the edge like Keys and Keys
(Isn't it obvious?)
That type of motherfucker'll never last
Take it up 'til he tears a motherfuckin' tree
And I feel like I'm on the brink, I can rip this bitch limb from limb
I just gotta keep going, this game is no exception,
'Cause every loss, I get an adrenaline rush,
I'm takin' every nut, hole, or hole
This bitch just won't quit, her breath is puke
She's mouth is up, man, this is no Grand Slam,
This is now tennis, you're now bout to lose your mind
This is now your brain blast, bitch, you're now brainin' blast
This is now your brain blast, bitch, you're now brainin' blast

My skin is too thick for me
If I want in a fight, I'm shove him
My heart's in the right place
The wrong place
The fuckin music's in place
I'm scared to death of Heidi
How do I get the word "tight" and not just
The word "fuck" should just mean
"Here's a cock-up, you can have cock-ups now"
Fuck cock-ups, fuck cock-ups.
Let them smoke (there they go)
Let them get high (there they go)

Verse 2 [Bizarre]:
Proof died when he turned on us
And this is why we came
He did it to make a new plan
And I'm a product of what his vision was
I'm gonna go back to that every time I get taken out
The bad news, the new everything
I'll be rewinding it, you did nothing but great
You just blew up and left me without a strand
Without a future in which to live
Without a career path that's better
Without a home than this
Without a care in which one to take
And this is why I'm leaving
I'm Clint Eastwood
My voice will go out like the telly
Told you this was my hugest ya know
This is why I'm leaving
Cause y'all gotta love it every single time
Everywhere you turn they tune you
Everywhere you swing or you hear the beat
It's like the tug of war with the beef that's tearing
You can take it to anybody you want, for anyone who wants it
You're fagot, your bitch, your sissy, thats why
My new motto is get a pussy
and boy they love it
Got a new Shady Murda beat to share
Shady Murda Murda, a.k.a. Mr. Muggs
My new motto is fuck a bitch
and get him and Mrs. Abraham Lincoln in the squad
Murder the bitch, I'll haul her off in the ambulance
I ain't mad, I'm like heyYo, I just had the pleasure of friendship and facine
Sippin gin till my throat is achy
From work, to make up for lost time, I'm late
Blaow every biscuit on my plate
Cut the toast, to the point, my clocks hit the floor
Sick continuously dippin fanta', in the dirt
Loosing teeth, and loosing my mind
I want my ass back, lo, I'm trying to snap back in time
And I won't even let you in your driveway
Been a part of this since I've stood a foot tall

Now you take my hand, and I can sit and goof
Over each others shoulders, like we're back in the 8 Mile
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
And I'mma make a new group if you can join me
Losing my mind all the time, just waiting to see how you move
'Cause I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
And I'mma make a new plan
And I'mma make a new plan
And I'mma make a new planYeah Yeah

I ever see a record being made of this shit
You can sound the alarm
You can edit the shit
You can whatever you want
I never been against black music or hip hop
I never been against it brought to you
I never been in favor of it
I never been against it brought up in it
I never heard of it
I never watched it go down (I never will)
But it's getting late I have time
and I have not yet got excuse
(just in case)
Something went wrong
I guess I forget what I just did
but I can't forget what I was supposed to do
but I can't be the bad apple that they (bad apple)

Now everybody from the 3 +1 listen to me
Don't be embarrassed, I'm serious
I said I would listen to you every time I spoke
And if you notice anything, uh, that you don't
I just did a song with Tillie over there
Yeah, and it was really dumb as well
As bad as the song itself was, I'm still pissed
As is his whole life
And this is just the way he's ended it
I don't even got a middle finger to cry on
And on, and off, like duck die
Die, die, die! And like "Eminem", you know you're my mom
I'm sorry mom!

I got a question, how are you doing lately
Compared to last week?
It's funny, I got a nice wife
Compared to how things are usually headed,

Up! Up! Up! Up!

====================
You can run, you can do whatever you want to this next level
Just be aware that there's a few level heads out there
You'll probably get annihilated by this next maniac
Hit your position and leave with a clean ass start
Just wake up the next day with the smell of cock
And find that you-re-a-motive, this next atrocity
Morphing and multiplying
You can do whatever you want to this next level
Just be aware that there's a few level heads out there
You'll probably get annihilated by this next maniac
Hit your position and leave with a clean ass start
Just wake up the next day with the smell of cock
And find that you-re-a-motive, this next atrocity
I can feel the extension cord tie me to a verbal knot
Ask the Nord, I'm a verbal knot
I get on well over the line, but I'd hate for you to be a couple
Cause I'm not a coming of age book, I'm a talking a verbal knot
It's a verbal knot, veteran me veteran (I'm coming for you)
I'm coming for you, veteran me, you, you
You know, I know what it's like to be a vocal, veteran
To be a fan favorite, veteran veteran
It's a verbal relationship, it's a verbal relationship
It just might work, you just might see it, you might not know it's gonna work
But until then, you better follow me
This ain't magic, I don't know a word to a zipper on the Phantom
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
I hold the weight of the whole Earth on my shoulders
I can't ever leave the game without gettin' tired of
And I got no desire to ever leave you
It's as simple as Say What Say
Say What Say it ain't Say What Say!
Say What Say it ain't Say What Say!
Say What Say it ain't Say What Say!
Don't you never say what you say without first kissing my ass
And then rippin' off the shoes I was on
'Cause I was on minimum wage, standing there in your shoes
And you just said what I thought it was OK to be black
Plus I got to look stupid, stupid, stupid, and watch me grow older
And understand, there's a reason I'm famous
It goes double on the playground changin' playground all night long
As kids confuse sense with wizardry
It's like the third sex in the Israeli Shvit, and K-I'm J'ovita
I stumble into the clinic with a sore hamstring
Eminem says he's taking a blood thinner, I say "Eminem on a blood bath"
They're gonna have a same shit-they say, I'm cum laude from Ready Player
And I'm emcee after emcee who just happens to be gay
Who just happens to be an ex-wife who's having a baby
But her life's like a fucking roller coaster, I'm about to lose my mind
I'm numbed bit, I start to feel drowsy
Then she starts crying
And I start to shove her breasts in her cleats
And I start to talk gibberish
I'm getting tired of all of this talk of me coming
And everything I come from
So I'm gonna turn off my music and listen to a couple of the new avatars
And it's not even music, I'm listening to a rapper who speaks in a flat, hush
And has a tattoo of my face on it, ho
Fo' fo' fo' child, what the f*** you talking about?
You're an extension high, you might as well wear a condom
Cuz if I need to, I could just spray you with gasoline and drown you
But look at me now, I bet you now you're much taller than you look
And you're hot as a balloon because you're still f***in' with it
I'm sorry Nick, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm bringin' back my daughter for her birthday next year
And I don't mean to make you look like a dadst*** tomorrow
But tonight I'm bringin' back my daughter for her birthday next year
And I don't mean to make you look like a dadst*** today
In the streets of Compton, people are goin' insane
People is bangin', some of them killing with the police
Some of them are just glad that they can stay
Some of them just want a little bit, a little bit of fame
Some of them just want it all, some of them just don't know it'sHush! (Hush!)
Sip some ho, this is
====================
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause, he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye?
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show'
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closetWake up
The dreams keep on creepin' out me
It's really crunchtime
What am I gonna do now?
Nothing's changed
They said I'll just make it up to Dre
But I keep walkin' up Sunset Boulevard
Looking like the skyline of record store Square
It's probably around 8 to 10 a.m.
I'm on another track to climb
There's no such thing as a headless chicken head
I'm headless chicken head, feel the force of my kicks
Ribs, and I keep on goin'
This is the stage we're here to perform at
We're all set to join in
Hippie over all, ho
No matter where you are, you're all headless
There's no such thing as a headless chicken head
I'm a master at dodging bullets
angled with objects fallin' into my path
I get entranced by invisible facts
Like invisible dates
And drinks with body parts
That's why I feel so strange
And everything I come from
Hip hop is in a state of suspended animation
It never really got this bad it was
I'm in the mirror with your mama
Looking like Britney Spears with braids and panties on
and your bra and panties on
and my feet are never moving
And my name is just Brett
I'm a slim
====================
Tricky, the way that I'm going at you, you can't duck it, you'll feel the force of these words against my skin
My skin is shatteringly strong and as swift as lightning bolts at pacer fabrications
No pun intended, but the facts are certain I'll be remembered as queer-hottest thing since pacer linen
But I've got a big ol' dick to screw and a big ol' dick to shove
And these facts are just the roughest I can manage itFeel so hopelessly switched on? Oh, it's so sad, I'm floatin over each new loop I'm on
I'm so attired, I'm proud, I know what I'm capable of
But I'm also so fucked, I'm so outta control, I almost feel like I'm going bananas
My tops are touching, my bottoms are thong
I'm not gonna finish them, I need to pee
I'm not gonna do them, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
I'm not gonna finish 'em, I need to pee
Uranium in my cup, urranium ate me
This is just the tip of the iceberg
I'm sure, if you go back and look at my real names
you'll find more, you should be jealous
I'm like a hot metal ball, with a heater attached
To a metal home, in a cold climate, oh,
I'm like a stone that's heated, is it?
Well I'm like a boulder with no legs, look
You should, if you ever want to see one, at all
I'm like an indo-rin slave
To this gun, like I'm B. R. G. G-unit from the first week
Or any other generic term, like generic nowadays
Turn the radio on, you go in the hottest club on earth
And get hailed like the Hey Yaowa
From the hip hop lexicon, like "Radio Codes for the Yaowa"
Relax, I probably been rapping like a fuckin Benz
While you bick-busters playin' with your fans, rippin' your rear end
And all you see is a bunch of stick-eared bastards
Who just happens to be hippies
(Ay, Detroit)
I came to the world in the sickle, puttin' my own asses at risk
Leavin' with a can of wax on it, while thugs from the 313 grind on
I'm winding down this drug that will put your pride to good use
Started off with crack, have you had a taste like this?
Or are you just an asshole
Who just happens to be more ignorant than I was
(I was born darlin', grew up darlin')
Dopamin' cocaine, and now I'm sayin' I'm throwin' up
Broke into people's homes and killin' people
(Shit, I can't, I've been cheatin' with a gun for so long)
I'm sick of this, what's the need? Give me some to eat (ha ha ha)
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause I'm Infinite
I'm sittin' here throwin' out my fists
Ha ha ha
Like my arm is just a consequence of this shit, you're not Obie
I done seen the worst, when you get dropped, y'all chase me
Like an autograph for your first album, or your first cover
====================
I just wanted to say thanks
And welcome to new country
I never meant to go down this road the right way
I never meant to leave this one behind
I never meant to be the one that disappeared
Oh well, I do live in a country now
sorry mama, I ain't here to be a dick
but fuckerkeepsake
If you couldn't call your own mother
you ain't fucked up, ain't you?
Now here I am in a new era
in a new era, in a new era
yo your up in this land, you better believe it
this ain't just some toy that I'm building for my little girl
I made this song out of, a song I wrote for my little girl
you heard it too uh
and I won't be making another single without this being my daughter
you've waited patiently
all these years squandered, this shit's finally over
I finally feel like leaving this world
I'm a fly in the water
no I'm not a quitter
I'm not dying, I'm standing up
I'm a stay the fuck out the closet
you've never smelled my stink ass
ever since I've been hidden inside of this fuckin' plant
And crippled since then, I've learned
How to fucking live with a plant
you better learn how to breathe
(Chorus)
Now I'm a do you thing, I got plants
In fact, I love you
The more you tell me you love me, the more jealous you'll be
I'm jealous too, you're my chip on my shoulder
I'm like a motherfuckin' man, I'm like a fuckin' boss
On another planet, but I ain't here to be a boss
I'm here to be a different man
I said there was a planet but I wasn't there
I got a daughter, grows up to be a villain
Then comes the mic check, and I'm out the booth
Pull up Slaughterhouse and stopped to flip the bird
You know what I say? The bitch won't stop spinning the wheel till I
Turn the gas pedal to the wall, now I'm like a rocking chair
Ain't no getting in, I'm getting pushed around by these cameras
And I'm tilting the lens towards the sky
Got a glass of tony's glass
And every time I go to try to assault him, he just blows the shit away
I'm taunting him like a taunting dog, he'll chase you mad
Macerator your rage, turn him into a flame to burn so
Shit, he's a fucking coward, I'll leave him to his fate alone
I'm like a little coward who gotrocketed
Started fucking around and lost my whole troop of fucking virgins
Started fucking around and I barely ducked
And I beat around the edges like a puppy, I'm going back
I'm going back to that fucking basement after I die
I'm going back to that fucking basement
I'm going back to that fucking basement
I hate you, hate you so much you're gonna think I'm fucking lunatics
On that fuckin' T-R-E bitch, she's hot
And I just hit her, with some of the most ridiculousness
I've ever seen, or heard of, but I'll shut up if you're tryin' to make any sense
You're fuckin' cowards, I'll shut up if you're tryin' to drink any milk
Boo, cowboys, brooms, back to the beribbon

Welcome to Murder Inc...
Murder Inc!
Matter of fact it is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
Matter of fact it is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
Matter of fact it is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
(Laugh)Here I go with the murder equestrian
clothes rags on my cock, hair on my neck
my balls are ragged my style is classic
but my reign of terror and terror
is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
(Eminem)Here I go with the murder equestrian
clothes rags on my cock, hair on my neck
my balls are ragged my style is classic
but my reign of terror and terror
is here
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terror
And I am indeed my reign of terror and terrorYeah manI wish I could be quiet
bye for the moment no I'm listening
I'm working on getting the mic to hit like rum and vr
so when you mention I miss your show I'll stop the tape
And get a message out to D12 from Baghdad
Mind if I copy and past it? 'cause they saying it here on track ain't that far from mine
[Chorus]
It's Like Two White Men Sitting On a Mountain

It's Like Two White Men Sitting On a Mountain

Shady Aftermath, hey Bob
First off pull the plugs on those speakers
I'm getting old, I don't remember much of anything (uh-huh)
So when they say I'm approaching an age of my career,
I say "younger" than me, apparently that's a misprint in my head
Ok, let me see it form like a circle and record it for you homie
So on this tape I'm asking you to mark one as being special
Special when I'm asked to name one individual
When I'm asked to name one lyric a line
He's immune to recall, "I'm from Detroit"
I'm asked to say a couple words, thematic and spiritual
The millennium is upon us, it's understandable
When I'm asked to walk up to the mic and spout some shit
And just spit it back in to the booth
I'm a man of my word, I can sit back and just let loose and revel
'cause I ain't even gotta make a Murda Inc album to know
Slim Shady, Slaughterhouse 9
Yeah, I'm that wack, wack
The way you twitch, I'm like Rorschachs with this stuff
Got Slaughterhouse signed books, already knowin' a Slaughterhouse is a killer
With a killer apperiser, of course I'm hittin' the needle
Just pull the paper out the plastic non-stop, what the fuck is Slaughterhouse about?
So you can sit back and just hammer it, we ain't that far from each other
All you gotta do is go in your room and just get your feelings heard
It's a strange bond, I produce strange shit
With a twist intended for you humble listeners, without the aid of any drug
I ain't saying much, I'm just trying to solidify my case
It ain't my fault, no it's my writing, what is it?
Poor little baby girl, left to her own devices
Is she getting her head up or do I a bunch of shekels
Valet for this Lexus, do they belong to me or Lexus
S'like grabbing a four-nine by the paces
And yackin' your lip while you play Suicidal Thoughts
A motherfuckin' bitch, I done found her, I pretty much ripped the page and cut the motherfuckin' text
Texts me unadulterated, "mommy, where you at?"
I'll put it on you can read it and laugh, or cry,
See this sunflower grow up in my legume, rip it off and eat it
And you couldn't even see the bud from the scratch I made (Chorus)
Cause I tore the leaf off the organic
And ate it and said, "You're pitiful, you're pitiful"
Cause organic's what you eat when you don't have
It devil's your strong suit, cause you eat shit
Like squirrels when you're sleeping
And if you eat the squirrels you'll probably get ill, throwin' a tantrum
But keep the fam up man, keep mumMay I have you open minded if I
====================
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was a killer
Now I'm convinced my momma fabricated the fact
That I moved out of the blue
Cause my daddy's a psychopath
My mom used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was a killer
But she never told me my crazy little sister
Now I'm convinced my momma's a big fat liar
She hidin' behind the "oh, she's a nice lady" excuse
But she's on the front runnin' momma's van
Got a bunch of Treacherous Tourettes
She's havin' this Cranberry Lager 'round the house
And I love every minute it's a bottle
I pop it and it's gone 'round every next morning
My head is clouded, my confidence is down
I'm 'bout to fall back and just snap
I'm 'bout to get high, hard as they fuckin'
Just as I'm about to pull up in that van
I see her pull up behind me
She's got a new bra, a new purse, a brand new watch
And I just chowd, "Hi, My Name Is"
I'm James Tarteenney, and I came up in the Vicious circle
And I don't know if I ever stopped speaking when
I went to jail for that, for that, I'm sorry
I never in my heart of my heart would have predicted
That I would catapult to the forefront in this game
And I don't mean to brag, but I'm only talking about
making it to the Hall of Fame
And I'm only talking about David Robinson's name, and
Riley's birthday, and Timbaland's birthday, and
My mother's the name's Elise Stefanetti
And my father's the name's Ronald Reagan
And if I ever do end up like Ronald Reagan
I'll never be as crazy as some thought I'd be
Because I know I can say f*** it, I'm going to do it
And I'm going to make it f***in' bitch again
So, raps with a line, verse after verse
Don't f***in' follow me 'cuz I don't know neither you or I know neither
Why we actin' up, raps with a line, verse after verse
Don't f*** in now, I'm bout to take my pants off, I'm bout to be stomped
I'm bout to be Crooked Unwanted, I'm bout to be Bombed
Fifty this man I'm getting paid, fifty this man I'm getting a heart attack
I'm bout to have my penis sliced off, I'm getting high as a kiteer
I'm bout to have my penis pushed up with a wire
Byron the Donner the barista, I'll kick your potatoes in a bunch
And I'll be cringey and rowdy as Doraemon
My conscience is a little twisted, but I'm happy
As long as you swallow cake, I'm just cashing in
'Cuz boy I'm getting old
I'm talking millions of baby boys and girls
All ready to dig in their grave and pull the plug when the call comes
'Cuz boy I'm getting old
I'm talking millions of baby boys and girls
All ready to dig in their grave and pull the plug when the call comes
'Cuz boy I'm getting old
I'm talking millions of baby boys and girls
All ready to dig in their grave and pull the plug when the call comes
I'm getting old
Mama-ama, I got the boy power in the bag
Take some of my milk, a couple of Xanax's, and some Xanax's
Swallow some booze, while I'm sipping my c*** up
Knock it off, Rick, knock it off, mama-ama said
You got the monster gene, I'm the one rapping off like an automat
Like an automat, I'm as bananas off a block of your furniture as a Kenwood
And it's looking like the future is on top, or on top
Of what, baking apples until the bone
Being able to spoon oven-rotten into a Kenwood pan
Whichever way you slice it, I'll always have a Kenwood
It's like an amazing arsenal, up at you
If I had a Kenwood, I'd let it rest before I lift it
Cause I'll never lift a Kenwood
It don't lift, you won't get a lift
I said, if I had a Kenwood, I'd let it rest before I lift it
Cause I'll never lift a Kenwood
I'm getting old
I'm talking millions of baby boys and girls
All ready to dig in
====================
And this is your label, plus two other labels that I'm bound to lose
If I stay in this seat, I'ma pop the globe
I took the hexagon, hopin' outta ships
And holding gangsters hoarse
This is my legacy, plus two other labels that I'm bound to lose
If I stay in this seat, I'ma pop the globe
I took the hexagon, hopin' outta ships
And holding gangsters hoarse
This is my legacy, plus two other labels that I'm bound to lose
Feelin' stupid for the mic to play, I got skillset
That make me a menace, on the mic to sing stupid shit
You ain't never been afraid to say stupid shit, you never been brave
You ain't never been warned don't be fooled by the hood, you ain't never been wrong
You've never been pulled over by the sheriffs or hired over the patrollers
You've never been asked if you got a heart problem or a heart problem
You've never been asked that but fuck 'cause you know you've never been perfect
You got rumors a heart attack in me and I know that's true
I know that I don't fit in with the gangsta brain, I just know that
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
Or if the shot if you don't got one, but I got one
Or if you don't want one, but I got one
I don't give a fuck about you not being there
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
Or if the shot if you don't got one
Or if you don't want one
I don't give a fuck about you not being there
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
Or if the shot if you don't got one
Or if you don't want one
I don't give a fuck about you not being there
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
Or if the shot if you don't got one
Or if you don't want one
I don't give a fuck about you not being there
That's why a lot of people hate me and say they want me, they don't know shit
Bitch you don't know what you'll do if I get hurt, get a new boyfriend
I'm sick of being pissed off, what's the matter?
Why would I hate another man when I can just chuck it?
I'm a sick, strange, and bizarre fuckup, fuck-up, asshole
Who happens to be a fan of your band, you know what I mean?
You know what I mean? You just mad that I don't get along with everyone
And fuck that, I'm not planning to attack anyone for being "unknown"
Just people that I know that I like, and I like
Other than "unknown", nobody on earth is as crazy as me
I'm just a sick, strange, and bizarre fuckup, I got weird uppers
On T.I., Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf
Oh myoh myoh myoh myoh myoh myo
These are the days of our lives, just imagine
Concert after concert
All we hear is pop, every band is skin deep
They pull the plugs on their thing, just to see who's the one
"Oh myoh myoh myoh myo myo myo"
The time has come to bring the feud to a close
To give the fans an even shake, without which no sane man would have believed
The power of a feud to overcome any of them
So start with the white boy, lead by the dumb kiddin
Then move on to the next kid, with all their dumb niggas
All they know is they can't fathom what's going through my mind
Anybody who's ever been through the grind than knows what I'm about to say
Don't fuck with these niggas after you bitch, fuck the store
You may not wanna talk to me after I say this but I'm f***in with you
Fuck your stores, I'm sure it's funny daddy, you fucked, but I wasn't bustin' a bustin' bustin' secret
Anybody who's ever been through the grind than knows what I'm
====================
You can't hear me
My brain's dead space, I don't know what's going on inside my head
I can't process what's going on inside my head
Now I feel like I'm in a trance
I've been dreaming about what it'd be like
To be you for as long as I remember
And everything you mean to me
It's just the truth I know
It's what I wanted to happen
But I waited too long for it to happen
'Cause I've been waiting for, long for
The moment when I want it
I just touch dirt and my body aches
Tried to stall it but I can't stay calm
And the moment is here for me to shine 'cause I've been waiting
It's now or never, and I'm dealing with these emotions
I'm dealing with these emotions everyday
And these emotions are coming
From somewhere that I don't know about yet
I'm dealing with these emotions, now
I'm dealing with these emotions now
Nowadays everybody's talking about how
They got to keep feeding this gravy train
And I rap circles are filled
With people that have never met me
But if you're gonna make the decision to try to
This is for the children that be exposed to this
And I know that making this record is
The most difficult part, is learning that you weren't
Going back and forth with anybody
Getting your music out and running
But you're not gonna get a crack from me
Because I'm not going to stop until I'm satisfied
My goal is to give you the raw, and I can feel it
Pancakes in your mouth, so let me stimulate you
I'm placing my faith and your trust so
Let me stimulate you, this is for you
The children, the women, the men that are gonna get nipple's
And I can feel it, it's growing inside of you
And I told you once you hear it I'm gonna make you arouse it
Arouse it, cause this is the moment
I'm placing my faith and your trust so
Let me stimulate you, this is for you
The children, the women, the men, the I'mI'm choosing to grow up to be an alcoholic
Carry a lit fuse, grow a pair and arm yourself
Keep your hands to the rings, and support one another
As we grow as men
We're going to have to deal with the fact
That we may have to face this shit we go through
And it ain't gonna be food for the sort of doubt that I have to spew it

In your mind, on the porch with the windows down
Solemnly swear to God, I ain't gotta break the bank
And raise the kids be doing the same
Sit and you beg to have something then?
Strap yourself in, hands like that of a man
Spit it out, like you're going against me, don't be sorry
Proof, Proof, Proof, you was the one that made me this angry
With my life, be sorry, be forever be forever be forever
Be careful what you wish you these little raps on, they may be good
We'll see but for now just shine
Show me the gems, show me what you come from
But I don't got no cents, just a proven habit
That you little green chick
Pop a bottle, we go through the process
And through the passage of time
We go through a change, like we lived through the past
And we change, but not every deed goes
Under the weather, in the shed
We take this pride when we spit it, we're new
And it tastes like Christmas cask-A
But I ain't holding my breath,
It's like the winter inside's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colder
And it's getting colder, it's getting colderYeah, I'm one to work with, don't be a hater
You know the drill, I'll be the first to snap
We'll be tussling, standing by
Beer goggles with heat maps with heat charts
Sitting at a dinner table, with a patient
Looking like Larry the cannibal, with a tube in his stomach tube
But his skin's quite a ways from curing so he's not dying
He's standing by his fucking ALS patient, hun
Wait a minute, this guy's his ass, yeah he sounds like Shady
I said his skin is quite a ways from curing so he
====================
Got a new weapon of Mass Destruction, your soul
Got your aura ripped back, by the people who saw the soul of Yoko on CD-40
(My Satan...)Mm!
Obie Trice! Yeah...
[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
Oh Em, its Dre time,
Now we have to turn the music off...
Let's goNiggas know that
We're watching ya
Trust me
Holla,
Yeah
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now we got to turn the music off
And show the world we love you
That's why we came to
From the world over,
Now we ain't stopping for nothing
That's why we came to
From the world over,
Now we can't always turn the lights off
Just pull up in the club and
Be ready to hear some more s***
And now for the rascal friends
You've been waiting for it
Silly rabbit boy
But I'm only joking
So don't get mad when I say that we're friends
We're just friends
And we're not friends we're in fact
Shady brothers
[Chorus]
And while we busy living and dying
Fuck yeah,
Cliff detroit, hoe state son
Blaze a pound of grass six days a week
You may be outta your mind's range of retarding
Battle 'em, let's repel them off to the slaughterhouse
And if you think your way is straight dope
Then straight grind, you're old and gone
You're not D.O.C.
You're a fraud
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace
You're a disgrace..[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to
Outro: Eminem, Rick Ross, Hillary, Cash, Soul Ass (for Cash)
[Outro:] Joe Budden, Joe Skarsgard, Eminem, Cashis
[Chorus: Joe Dollman]
Eminem and Joe Budden (both)
Standin' over you in the heat
You're fuckin' with me
I'm a sucker with a magic wand
You can do anything you want to do
Man, I'm socked in the tonsils
Came up awkward, awkward
From awkward awkward
To awkward awkward
Till you get awkward, awkward
Cause you're awkward, awkward
[Outro]
I'll bullshit your pranks
You clowns ain't ready
'cause I'm a sitchel full of zeroes
And I'm so tired of bein' hated
That you don't inspire me by lead or silver
I pull my knives wit lead and I don't feed by a hair
'cause I'm a follower of Jesus, man
And I'm a sucker with a magic wand
You can do anything you want to do
Man, I'm a sucker with a magic wand
You can do anything you want to do
I'll bullshit your pranks
You clowns ain't ready
I'll bullshit your pranks
I have everything in my possession
The key to heaven, power to turn it to fire
And I'm a sucker with a key to kingdom come
So whoever you are, whoever you use weed
Or you get high
You'll get high, but you won't get high after that
You'll get high, but you won't get high after that
You'll get high, but you won't get high after that
You'll get high, but you won't get high after that
You'll get high, but you won't get high Aftermath, baby (baby)
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (key lime)
I'll sign it to you, put it in your pocket
Now if they want it, I'll let 'em get it
[Outro]
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I'm at the peak, I'm8 feet, but I couldn't stoop that high
I know my health's sufferin' but I'm well on my way to health
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I'm at the top of my game, but I can't do this one
So I'm jokin', up like a mountain troll
And I'm damn near impossible to convince, all green '
====================
In the car, when we get back to Detroit, we're gonna do it in truancy
Just be ready for anything that comes our way
So be it rain or shine, snow, pain
Just tempt it hell, let it rain or shine
So be it rain or shine, snow, snow, pain
Just tempt it hell, let it rain or shine
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe buy a couple of sample models
And possibly have a little heartbreak, ah
But here we go, we're gonna do it again
In a week where Christmas comes early, eh?
Lets do it again, lets do it again (Huh?)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
We can, we should, pretend that there's no weather affecting
You know, it's just the real thing, right?
But pretend ignorance is the charm
Of a rusty iron, stuck in this climate
Like rusty daggers, that's pretend.
But I bet you they won't let us pretend, that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
We can, we should, pretend that there's no weather affecting
You know, it's just the real thing, right?
But pretend it's not so fake, then fly away,
Or pretend it's real, then fly away,
Either one of us will get to the root of the matter
Before the other will even think to try to put it
Let's pretend like they're not exactly peas in my pants
So pretend they're not gonna get along just yet
And fuck your friends around the house,
Making sure that they're all dudes
You know, like pretending they don't know each other
And fuck the house, you know, just know
And fuck the neighborhood, you know, just know
And fuck the city, you know, you know
You know, I know I'm theist, you know
I'm against magic, you know
And I'm for the destruction of all things human
Impeccable ego, yeah, you know
You know, fuck men they destroy women
And I know that some won't admit it
But they all will admit it
And I know that some will
But they all will agree
It's raining down bombs, I already got, uhh
Women on my terms, you know
You better hide, how you acting like a freak when you're alone
Thecophony, it's actually a relief, being front in the crush
Of accusations, thecant hide
But I swear on everything, I'll be the first to admit
I'm better than doped
You betta let me
Just lay on the ground and I'll start over
You better start reflectionin'
Look, I give a fuck what you think
You better start off with the rosey
Or the crack, the crack, the crack
Yeah, I give a fuck what you think
You better start off with the scratch
Or the crap, the crap, the crack
I ain't even sure if I like it or not
But whatever, I'm back in this game, finally
And I give a fuck where I'm from, who I be
Joell Ortiz:
Jealousy, jealousy, I'm everywhere
When I talks, I'm like ''You're only jealous of me because of me''
When I cooks, I'm like ''You cook, you're last man''
Write this shit, you'll be jealous too, I'm on you
I'm a showbiz asshole, don't you know this
But I be the real G, you're a staged miracle
I'm in a relationship with a contortion, medical issue
Complete medical bar exam
You pregnant, I ain't had a boyfriend since
My junior year of high school, we had this
Bi-polar, bi-poles, bisexual, porpoises
With penis in asses and labia, trippin' pills
In your purse, maybe that'll help you forget it
If it works, you mop it up and stuff it in a zippin' pot
Quit the shit, I ain't playing, I'm mopin' the floors
With laces on my shoes, I'ma get obby, asses scrubbin'
Ballin' all the way, I ain't layin' here to bat teary like
Dre, you ain't eying, I'm just psyched out this game could you
Give me a lil' name or a briefcase
I'm bringin' this country to greatness,
I'm crazy when I say I'm populin'
People say I'm weak, say I'm stupid,
But I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to go to my heart
And to experiment, I'm
====================
In the same place in the same pen
two lines to end all forms
of hate and discrimination
From now on every public facility
Be it a public place where a man's allowed to gather
Stand on his feet, as they pass, while a bystander steps
He's a man, he's a soldier, there's no reason he can't take the place of a faceless jerk
Who's there just to get high, but can't do anything about it?
So he sticks his penis in the air and dicks it, then he gags it
When he buries his penis in the back of a Porsche, it's like a true crime
His actions just hide the fact, that he tried to come out of retirement
But he hides his sensitive little mind, dickbags
Who just happens to be out in the country camping out at the trailhead
And Nathan's about to be a huge sight to see
Blow this trailer into nothingness, then he stumbles into a trailer park
And this is the trailer that God gave us
So take a look who's next, before you fall
Down, on the ground, next to the garbage man
Talk a little shit, then he strays and that's it
Got laughs, got respect, but he ain't got no respect
And heck, his dick just fellin' out, another g,
Bitch you bad, get a beat and suck a dick
And God sent you all the way, but God damn you tomorrow
You should've put that on the record
Cause now we all going insane
'Cause now you're laying on the couch with that shit
Cause now your corpse's laying dead
On the floor, get a new position
On the rug, there's nothing but a bunch of dead bodies
Going every night with no life in them pillows
Trying to drag each other out of bed
Walking bare-knuckle boxing with sticks shoved against each other
This war, these people don't want a war
They just want a bigger one, they like big hugs
And big hugs, don't you try to be mean and act like you don't understand
I'm tryin' to grow a fuckin' butt like a cow
And I bet you if you'd listen to us
We wouldn't be here so you wouldn't have to do much
Fuck, I'm tryin' to grow a fuckin' butt like a cow
And I bet you if you'd listen to us
We wouldn't be here so you wouldn't have to do much
Fuck, I'm trying to grow a fucking butt like a cow
And I bet you if you'd listen to us
We wouldn't be here so you wouldn't have to do much
Fuck, I'm trying to grow a fucking butt like a cow
Shady 2.0
There's really not that much that we can do other than what you say
But we can do a lot of things, like whatcha do
And I bet you if you did, what you say
It would go a lot deeper, you crazy
And probably hurt a lot of shoulders, but I'm carryin' a lot
As long as I can, I'ma' belt to go to your back, like I'ma' never give up
Even if it means going back to always be tough
Be the first to go in and stop and pick yourself back up
It's probably funny, like I almost have a mental image of B. Real
But there's a certain certain certain certain certain B.
There goes another headache, another loss
I feel like I'm stuck, with a lit fuse
And everything is spirgin' out of control
I just realized every day is like a newfangled day
Every other day is another hungover guy from
Mama-tan, mama-tan, mama-tan, mama-tan
Going in with a hangover, big wench wasted
Shoulda died for this shit to work
Instead I'm a boneheaded alcoholic, constant loop
I'm gettin' you gross
When the mic drops I'm a rakish object to be sneered at
And this second you go amen
"But it wasn't you, it was I"?
Cause at this rate this shit will never stop
You can be as rude as Fred Durst
As Durst didn't you was ass ta spite
Asking for money for drinks for your ass to moan about
You couldn't care less bitch you was ripping on me
And I thought you shit was disgusting was all that And I hate youAnd everyone should get along,
'cause everybody do'es their thing and do'es what
Everybody does',s got a couple's heads set backin' out
And I don't really care what you call me And everyone does'
And I don't really care what you call me And
====================
At first glance, this may seem a little crazy, but I'M CANTO BE CUNT!
I know it feels like I'm
Starting to get really big inside and it's really
Enough bullshit for everybody to hate
You want to start shit, you start seeds?
Shite kick it, start start shit!
Introduceable chump, I'm looking at these cocksuckers at a premium
I might just start feeding off these tits, at a premium
And at the same time at the Mercedes and follow these cocks
And then he will be finished off with Oprah
And I'm starting to get low key, but I'm appreciatin'
So low I might as well put the heater on and get my pants heater lit
I'm in the back seat of a Gremlin and turn off all the music
(Steady on the right, right, left)
evil little evil little evil little
And then I ambush the dealership and I'll have all the
Upfronts ready for anyone type of dealership
Upfront man is in the mood for his shit alone
Man is he up to the business, he's black
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Man, right, left]
[Speeder, lurker]
Up until the very last minute, you
Did just shit on me
My jaws were just slizzling right after, she smacked him
With it, struck him with his booth, strike him with his table
Dripped him to the ground, forced him to the basement
Then bit him with a steel slizzle stand, forced him to the corner of the room
Now look who's back again
Aftermath, yeah, again
Your undoing, your committing, you will not get made fun of
Every time Dre says whats happening in the game, beefed up
The 30 is up, the competition is stiff
Just look at the drama it's playground everywhere we go
Can't pass up a favor if you got 'em asking for my aid
Nah man, you could much prefer to having me whip your ass while you're spraying words
Just know that I will not rest until you get your ass ached
And when we leave the house of pain you'll be missing
And all of y'all, 'bout to catch a glimpse of me
As soon as we roll up on the next victim to be scooped
It ain't no talking to the doe, when I'm punching the doge
I ain't going to back down when I come to life
And have you Cubrickin' and beatin' your deadbeat son
With a stapler, you buggin' me to behave
When I spit at you like I spit at you taquit
I cheat death and destruction with my vato
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like 2pac
I seen, sights flash in the place where I place
Money like gold bar, two black bars
With gold fakes in the wrapper, money like diamond,
Watchin' dollars burn, here's a smidgen
Crack cocaine, put your debit card up in the smoke
And have your infrared up in your mag, jump a fence post
Watch your back, with cat paws, to slow things down
Back when hoes didn't have legs, how did this become a thing?
Back when motz ran roughnin' roaches
And now fox feeds him raw coke, how did this become a thing?
I guess in the name of 'Father, I beg you, to send the best for me]
[Eminem:]
Campaign, yeah, I'm back, let's go back in time and 'quit now's a wasted trip.
Campaign, yeah, I'm back, let's go back in time and 'quit now's a wasted trip.
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, E
Yeah, yeah, you got your hands on my daughter, what do you want me to be mate?
Mateu, you a waste of time, I'mma take you back to 9th grade!
Mateu, you a waste of time, I'mma end up in a fucking trash can right here!
Bitch, I'ma wrap you in knot, I'ma pulverize your head, like a beanpole
You a pricker, you a sic on your opponents senses
I'll be right here when you need me, I'll be right here when you don't
Look, I can't stress enough the difference between me and you
I made this song to prove that I can be this slut from nowhere

====================
If you get in the way
And you see a girl that seems to be on the get-go
Ask about her boobs and they know -- they know
She's got those damn Torches, I've been thinking about that talkin'
Talkin about that damn slit, yeah baby slit that woman, that little girl
That slim kid, girl, little girl, little girl, little girl
Going at me, Ja shit, I don't wanna see you get
Hit, with a baseball bat, bat or some other bat that could give
Someone the key to the room so the cops can come get you.
 If you ev'ry now and it's your birthday tomorrow
And you want to make that threat now get up
Standing there in the sun with your fuckin' eyes out
It's gonna be so fuckin' rough, really fuckin' rough
Will someone please come get me, baby, please come get me
before I get any help I need, baby, from some nutty nutty rapper
Who just struck a deal to come back and blow the shit up
And he ain't gonna be back for don't know what he did.
Who he was, he never told you that he's a black man
And you shouldn't think either way that you may have heard it just yet
'Cause I'm gonna sue you, nigga see ya
What you gonna do, duck, turn and look?
You ain't gonna get on the plane back
When I'm crashing right after you with "Enter theClub"
"It's your mother's birthday, come over here and have a seat"
"Mom, what you make that for?"
"Nothing, he's done it before"
Dude, don't be ridiculous dame"

We find Eddie, and handcuff him, turns around and gives you the boyz!!
Oh shit, oh God, I'm losing my mind. I have no memories, I think I memory laps

Cuz I was in a rage, and I remember I hit em all over the place, all over the place
And I hit em all over the place, and I don't remember why I did it all the way though
I thought I was shady, cause I think I was shady
Did you ever think you'd get caught if you went to Where?
I dunno, I think you did, and I think you did
And I'm gonna be back, and I'm gonna be black and orange, like I don't remember
Fuckin' and I don't give a fuck, like I'm not give a fuck
Pitying lot and I'm gonna start a fire with my nuts under the foreskin
I don't wanna start a war, I don't wanna start one, I don't wanna put up with the fucking after thought
I'm only joking, I'm fucking you, you're only laughing!
Oh shit, I'm having a hard time keeping my temper up
I must be doing some greggin' around here, I must be trying to get my dick sucked
Fuck you, fuckin' tongueless pussies!

====================
My friends call me rash little faggots
But I hold the whole bag,
Sits on both knees and cocks it back right to the rack
'Cause I ain't going no where' (Shout out to Snoop Dogg)
Snoop, you ain't really never mein'
You a loser, I gave you the keys to the shed
Me and Dre went to get that damn mattress back
Baby I'm Slim Shady, I'm goin' no where!
(Snoop)
I'm just kidding daddy, I ain't got no money
I used to sell diapers and buy some poles
But I can't no longer go to sleep because I'm wake up stuck in the middle of my daughter's stunted cornish
(Snoop)
I can't no longer sleep, I'm still standing up
Like I told you I got the whole "M" in me in "speak up motherfucker"
Now I can't even write, I'm standin' up still
Like I told you I got the whole "M" in me in "speak up motherfucker"
Now I can't even write, I'm standin' up still
Like I told you I got the whole "M" in me in "speak up motherfucker"
Shady, what the fuck you sayin'?
Yeah, it ain't business,
I don't even know what you said in that song,
But I just fine so let me ask you one more time
Marshall, you ever been up in the woods yet?
Ever been up in the woods yet?
I've been up in the mountains since the place where I grew up was dry up with the reindeer
And Frodo and Gimli and Oha and Velothan and Veloth
You've all been wind in this motherfucking sky,
Marshall?
Fo' I haven't seen a thing, nothing but silence
Like I been dreaming and working, I'm dreaming and dreaming
I've been dreaming in the thick of motherfucking winter
Tryna get some air in the mouth, nothing (Nothing)
But I think I'm getting somewhere, maybe a nice hotel
Something nice to do some winter music
On the stereo, playing some songs
Some with Elton, some with Peter
Some with Peter, some with Mark
Eminem:
Hello, my name is Em
My name is Mark
My name is Emy
My name is Marko
My name is Marko
Eminem:
Hi, my name is Emy
My name is Mark

Slim Shady, a local rapper, was kinda saving up a cassette for my brother when
he saw this shit on T-V and said, "Man, what the fuck, let me?"
I said, "Fuck it, I'mma put this on"
And got on the bus, drove up and lost two of my dear friends
And now I'm stuck with a thousand dollars, because I just took it?
That's why I ain't got the change, I'm like this is how you get rich?
Sir, how you doin this? You feel sooooo bad you can't stand it?
Well, let me give you the whole rap game, starting with your hoe
You're motherfucking son-of-a-bitch, and I'mma have you through to ya
You'll be cause I'm the rhyme book, where the fuck did it all begin?
I'm a Genius, I'm a fucking Mechanical spider, I'll Break Things Down
Let me walk up in a crowd, blow up your mood, and throw your whole crowd up
And I'm not give a fuck if the crowd disss me, I can turn on you like "Do-si-do"
And you're like "Oh Shit, We're Done"
I'm infinite
I go on
I've been an infinite
I'm a tapeworm, tapeworm, infinite
My home planet, my home planet
And I'm coming for you, like hello, do-si-do
And you'll be waiting right here
On my side of the aisle, tapeworm
I'm infinite
I go on
I've been an infinite
I'm a tapeworm, tapeworm, infinite
My life is infinite, I grow older
I'm tapewormin' for you to drag me to where I want to go
I'm infinite
I go on
I've been an infinite
I'm
====================
Go back to the center of this crowd and make 'em mad
And throw 'em in the mud with me
Is that a bass drum or a stick saw?
A jack hammer or a saw blade?
Who knows?
Maybe that was the last time you saw me you jealous of me
You and me, maybe it was the day you said you left me and say I left you a better man.
Maybe that was the day you said you left me and say I hate you more than me
I tried to salvage a better life for you and failed you.
Maybe that was the day you said you left me and say I hate you more than me
I tried to salvage a better life for you and failed you.
You see, I was trying to salvage a better life for you and I didn't see that coming.
Maybe that's why I couldn't cook, couldn't write a rhyme, couldn't be a father, had to be a piece of shit.
Maybe that's why I can't be mad at you for what you did for me, can't be mad at me.
When I see you with your hands up and I'll all be down and follow suit
I'll restrain you like a rope, keeping you in but one little thing.
And Mariah ain't got no lawyer
Not this year, she very well may be ill
But she's keeping Michael an official illity, fact
I knew that if I get divorced she'll all be ashes
So why don't you all sit at your desk and just let fall the ashes
In the stands, let people come out, and boo while I drop the microphone
'?
Donnell please, no one will listen
Sittin' on the stoop, stoop, stoop
And I don't listen to feet, I just flip 'em the bird
And follow her wherever she lead her bling
Til she she she dead-b-owl, gone be bow-bow like a bow-bow-bow.
And I'm sick of acting like Debbie Downey, you know?
'Cause I'm not just talking clubs and shit
I'm talking everything from room to room
In the club and the hallway like 8 clubs
And I got a secret in Lysol and a white Nike
Swimmin' in magazines and g-stringin' like I'm Slim Shady
I'm Eminem, Shady's my brain, his was the D
I just blew up show to start a new chapter
Brain dead, and I'm regretting my actions
I'm regretting my past actions, past partners
And I'm sorry I didn't do more to deserve it
In the mirror I have, asserteous mirror
With diamond shaped face and sheer build
So Gwen Stefani wouldn't be my first choice
Cause I was Kim, my first choice
'Cause Kim's a fuckin' mess
Fat girl, asserteous!
And I'm sorry I was wrong
In the sense that I was already a prime candidate
For the lead, what that make me all of a sudden
Not gonna be, no why, stop in a million fucks
And I'm sorry I was wrong
In the sense that I was already a prime candidateFor the lead, what that make me all of a suddenNot know what I'm doin'
I don't know what the fuck I'm doin'
I love being broke as much as you do
But I love being back in the game and back in the day
I was writers' block, writers block, writers block, eh
I'm the type that'll let your bitch get what she wants
I bully bitches, spill insults and laugh
That's it, that's all they ever say
I bully bitches, and spill insults and laugh
That's it, that's all they ever say
And as for all these other bags
I bag 'em all, and that's all I ever do
I just do what I'm told, and I'm never asked to do
So I look stupid like you on that jibe
Bitch, I bag you, mentally I'm just using you for a reason
I already said I's a pussy, not Shady, I'm not the first one to do that
Hey, it's me, the real Shady, you're a four-eighty with a strap-on
You'll never, under any circumstances
You're under my thumb, literally, no matter how many times I say it
You'll never, under any circumstances
You're real, you're a piece of shit
If you ever, get dragged to the brink
I'm probably gonna just snap, fuckin' ass, and leave it at that
Like Kim and Kanye, and have them both go
Under my damn thumb, and leave it at that
At least till the day I die
